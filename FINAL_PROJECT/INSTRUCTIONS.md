# Instructions for the Naruto Search Engine

Hello and welcome to **HALM Naruto Search**! 

Halm Naruto search works on the Dataset of English subtitles to 200+ episodes of the Japanese anime series Naruto https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto.

To get the **Naruto Search Engine** to work you need to download the **FINAL_PROJECT** folder with all of its contents (except the Tests folder is not necessary), and run it via Flask python framework.

## Search modes

There are 3 different search modes – **Boolean**, **TF-IDF** and **Stems**. Before inputting the keyword you want to find you have to choose one of the 3 search modes!

**Boolean Search** – allows to look for a single term (e.g. "cat"), or also for a combinations of terms joined by Boolean operators **AND**, **NOT**, **OR** (e.g. "cat OR dog"). Boolean operators in the input-field should be CAPITALISED so that search engine understands them as logical operators and not as the words to look for.

- TF-IDF
 Can search for bigrams when using " "
 What is the result the search shows (i. e. what is TfidfVectorizer, what is a best match etc.)

- Stems
 What are stems
