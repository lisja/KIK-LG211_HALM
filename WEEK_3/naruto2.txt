1
1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:13,930
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,610
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,300
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,900
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,960
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,230
Our two hearts
11
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,550
Kiba!
12
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,860
Naruto!
13
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,360
You okay, Kiba?
14
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,130
Yeah…
15
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,360
Is this also Genjutsu…?!
16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,070
No one, including Akamaru,
can escape from Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
17
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,240
It’s because…
18
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,540
we have an enlarged neural tube…
the cerebrum…
19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,110
Guys, move away from the door!
20
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,550
Parasitic Insects.
21
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,260
Please, Sensei…
Tell me the truth.
22
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,300
If you don’t…I’ll rub you out…
23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,770
I reached the decision
to seal your Genjutsu power
24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,570
at my own discretion.
25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,540
It has nothing to do with
the Third Hokage…
26
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,550
Vent your resentment…
27
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,160
The only one you should hate is me…
28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,560
I heard…!
29
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,560
I heard you and
the Third Hokage talking
30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,960
about trying to destroy
the Kurama Clan!
31
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,830
Yakumo, you’ve got the wrong idea.
32
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,240
You lie!
33
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,070
No way could my mother
and father die in just a fire!
34
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,350
My parents were killed…!
35
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,350
What?!
36
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,490
Shino…
37
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,970
What’s this?!
38
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,440
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
39
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,540
All right!
40
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,110
I’m counting on you guys!
41
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,310
–Right! 					–Right!
42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,510
Now, I’m ready when you are…
43
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,250
One, two…
44
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,220
Charge!
45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,150
Go!
46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
N-Naruto…
47
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,970
Naruto?!
48
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,940
Kurenai Sensei!
What happened to your…?
49
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,080
Yakumo, did you do this…?
50
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,650
That person tried to eliminate me…
51
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,550
So she’s just facing the consequences.
52
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,320
You’re wrong!
53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,050
Yakumo, you’ve
misunderstood something.
54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,560
I heard everything about you and
Kurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai.
55
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,590
Stop, Naruto!
56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,170
Listen up.
Kurenai Sensei sealed your powers
57
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,340
because she cares about you!
58
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,300
What’re you talking about?!
59
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,670
You’re not the only one who’s suffering!
60
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,510
Kurenai Sensei hid the truth all
this time and has suffered alone!
61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Stop!
62
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,750
The…truth…?
63
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,160
The Supposed Sealed Ability
64
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,070
Guy Sensei!
65
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,400
Hey, where is everyone?!
66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,570
Shino and Hinata are standing
watch in the hallway,
67
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,540
but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto
68
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,810
are now inside the world
created by Yakumo’s Genjutsu!
69
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,510
Huh? What do you mean?!
70
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,480
I’ll explain…
71
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,550
Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy.
72
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,690
No… I must now
explain the truth…
73
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Nobody has taken such affectionate care
of Yakumo as Kurenai.
74
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,930
Kurenai’s resolve was to get Yakumo
to give up on being a Shinobi…
75
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,540
Yakumo was completely in low spirits.
76
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,380
Lord Murakumo was also concerned…
77
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,550
Then one day, that incident occurred…
78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,350
The residence of the head family
burned to the ground
79
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,390
and Yakumo stood motionless
in front of it…
80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I saw it at that time…
81
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,400
The form of a monster with
a face like a female demon
82
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,570
hovering in the flames…!
83
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,380
After learning of its identity…
I became frozen with terror.
84
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,880
What is…the truth?!
85
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,960
Sensei… What the heck is happening
to Yakumo…?
86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
This is bad…!
87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Yakumo! You don’t know…
88
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,130
You don’t know anything!
89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,770
Something’s… Yes…
90
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,140
There is something…
in the recesses of my mind…
91
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,550
But… What is it…?
I can’t remember…
92
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,020
Oh no…!
93
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,820
Naruto, stop that!
94
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,250
Huh?!
95
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,560
Naruto!
96
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,560
What is this thing?!
Damn it. Let me go!
97
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,120
All I want to do is live up to
everyone’s expectations, and yours.
98
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,390
And yet…
Why does everyone get in my way?
99
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,360
I just want to become a Genjutsu user…
100
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,560
People have their respective
appropriate paths.
101
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,570
You probably have your own path.
102
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
That’s right…
103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,100
There’s no need to force yourself
to become a Shinobi…
104
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,070
No… I don’t want that!
105
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,340
Everyone may comfort me with words…
106
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,540
But I know.
I know they’re disappointed in me.
107
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,050
I can’t stand having to live
my whole life feeling that burden.
108
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,460
Yakumo, what’s that…?
109
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,960
R-Run, Uroko!
110
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,880
Yakumo!
111
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,730
I remember…
112
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Yakumo…?!
113
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,570
Yes…me…
114
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,900
The person inside me killed
my mother and father…!
115
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,670
I killed them with Genjutsu!
116
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,980
No, Yakumo!
That wasn’t you…
117
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,550
You and that monster are different!
118
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,150
No, we’re not different…
119
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,650
You see, that thing…
was living inside my heart.
120
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Thanks… Kurenai Sensei…
121
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,570
Goodbye…
122
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,070
Stop!
123
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,540
Yakumo!
124
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,650
Wh-What’s…that…?!
125
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,560
In order for us to get
a clear picture of the incident,
126
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,730
we first requested
a complete examination of Yakumo…
127
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,770
As a result, we learned the monster
that appeared at the time of the fire
128
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,050
was an Id Monster so to speak,
created by Yakumo’s sub-consciousness.
129
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,990
An Id…Monster…
130
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,830
Then I made a direct appeal
to the Third Hokage…
131
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,130
Ultimately, Yakumo could
not endure the weight
132
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,630
of living up to our expectations
from the time she was little
133
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,540
and that triggered her sub-consciousness
to attempt to expunge everything.
134
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,840
Yakumo’s sub-consciousness
will probably attempt to
135
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,480
expunge the Kurama Clan
and eventually the entire Leaf Village.
136
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,520
I cannot consent to that…
137
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,720
Despite such a risk,
138
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:23,230
taking the life of Yakumo who has
no awareness of evil cannot be allowed!
139
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,560
It’ll be too late
140
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,570
once her sub-consciousness
completely awakens!
141
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,540
Then we just have to get her
to learn how to control it herself…
142
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,540
or seal her powers if that’s not possible.
143
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,540
But…
144
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,310
Although slightly different
from Yakumo’s case…
145
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,390
There’s a precedent of a baby being used
to seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.
146
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
That’s absurd…!
147
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,220
There isn’t a Jutsu practitioner
148
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,760
who can seal the strong powers
Yakumo possesses…
149
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,670
There might be just one person
who can accomplish that…
150
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,440
However, it will become
a painful mission.
151
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,970
Hopefully, this person can teach her
how to control her powers…
152
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,540
But if it comes to sealing her powers,
153
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,380
the Jutsu practitioner will end up
erasing all the potential in the child…
154
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,850
The Jutsu practitioner will
have to live with the burden
155
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,520
of Yakumo’s resentment
in place of the Kurama Clan…
156
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,090
The Third Hokage said that
and then cried.
157
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
The one who accepted that
painful mission was…
158
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,130
Yuhi Kurenai.
159
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
I see…
160
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,540
So that’s what Kurenai Sensei
was talking about.
161
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,580
I…didn’t know anything about Sensei…
162
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,020
I knew that Kurenai had sealed
Yakumo’s powers…
163
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,550
But it’s the first time I’ve heard
164
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,820
about the incident
her sub-consciousness caused.
165
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,190
Yes… The Third Hokage passed away
166
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,990
and at this point, it’s a secret known only
to the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai.
167
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,170
She made herself into the bad guy
and kept the secret, huh…?
168
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,930
Kurenai Sensei…!
169
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,070
You go, too!
170
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,670
–But… 					–Sakura…
171
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,840
I’ll take over things here…!
172
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,610
Guy Sensei…
173
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,380
You’re concerned about Naruto
and the others, right?
174
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,410
Go to them…!
175
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Right!
176
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,390
I leave Yakumo…to you…
177
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
What is it…?
178
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,600
I don’t know… But…
179
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,430
This feeling…
180
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,540
It’s somehow
entirely different from before…
181
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,340
My insects are acting strange.
182
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,710
What’s going on inside?!
ls Kurenai Sensei okay?
183
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,880
It’s powerful…
184
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,520
A massive Chakra beyond compare
is being produced…!
185
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Naruto…
186
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,180
Why…? Why do you have
to take your own life…?
187
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,540
What…?!
188
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,850
What must be destroyed are the ones
189
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,750
who forced you to shoulder
a heavy burden
190
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,690
and on top of that,
tried to eliminate me…!
191
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Who’re you…?
192
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,860
I crept into an opening in the depths
of your mind and was nurtured.
193
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
My name is Id…!
194
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,750
She’s finally awoken…
195
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,690
Kurenai Sensei,
what is that thing?
196
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,930
It happened soon after I was made
Yakumo’s personal instructor.
197
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,000
It was when I had doubts about
the high level of Yakumo’s Genjutsu
198
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,570
and looked into her deep psyche.
199
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,270
I discovered that thing!
200
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,670
I could only stand motionless
in front of that terrible figure.
201
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,540
It wasn’t Yakumo whom
the Third Hokage said to eliminate…
202
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,540
It was her Id monster…
203
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,750
So that’s what it was…?
204
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,820
This ominous ghastliness…
is more powerful than before.
205
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,550
But I must stop it from getting
into the real world,
206
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,160
even if we have to kill each other…!
207
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Kill each other?! 					I see…
208
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,930
She was that determined…
209
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,300
So that’s why she quit Squad Eight.
210
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,640
I’ll take your feelings into this body
and settle the score…
211
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,810
You jerk!
212
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,480
You’re in the way. Move it!
213
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,850
Naruto!
214
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,230
I don’t know
what the heck you are…
215
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,370
But Kiba, Shino, Hinata,
they’re all waiting for Sensei’s return!
216
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,430
Naruto…!
217
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,940
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
218
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,970
My Jutsu won’t activate in this world…!
219
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,950
You are a thorn in my side…
I’ll erase you first.
220
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Look out!
221
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,550
Yakumo, you’re the only one
who can defeat it now!
222
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,890
What…?
223
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,560
Listen, Yakumo… All people have
a fanged beast in their minds…
224
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,560
It always lives in the depths of
a person’s mind
225
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,400
and will suddenly appear.
226
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,100
The power of the beast that
appears is enormous and
227
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,140
regardless of one’s own will,
it can inadvertently hurt those around it.
228
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,480
But…if that monster can be tamed
229
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,550
and then controlled
with one’s own power…
230
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,750
It becomes a magnificent power
231
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,560
and acts to make
your dreams come true.
232
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,560
Now, fight!
233
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Abate by your own hand
the monster you created!
234
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,540
B-But…
235
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,540
Yakumo, only you can do this!
236
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,550
Die, boy…
237
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,420
Darkness in my mind, abate!
238
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,320
Die!
239
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:48,540
Why…? 					I…served…you well…
240
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,960
Kurenai Sensei,
you’re back to normal!
241
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,000
Kurenai…Sensei…
242
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,540
You did well, Yakumo…
You defeated your own darkness.
243
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,340
Sensei…
244
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,380
You did it, Yakumo…
245
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
Yakumo…
246
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,820
She knew exactly who was
really trying to save her…
247
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,990
–Kurenai Sensei! 					–Sensei…
248
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,320
It’s okay now!
249
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,130
Kurenai Sensei…
250
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,230
You’ll go back to being
everyone’s teacher, right?
251
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
That’s right…
252
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,300
My final mission from
the Third Hokage is over…
253
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
–Sensei! 					–Sensei!
254
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,080
That’s great that things could
get back to normal…
255
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Sakura…!
256
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,810
Naruto…?
257
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,550
I will too.
258
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,560
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
259
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,900
Will always be smiling right near by
260
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,640
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
261
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,380
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
262
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,320
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
263
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,160
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
264
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,100
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
265
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,470
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
266
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,800
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
267
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,310
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
268
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,180
The wind is probably testing our hearts
269
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,520
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
270
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,560
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
271
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,500
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
272
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,130
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
273
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:44,310
Will always be smiling right near by
274
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,220
This isn’t funny!
275
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,750
Why do we have to get all worn out
for someone like him?
276
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,990
Exactly! We were told to protect
the Beauty of Nature,
277
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,560
but he keeps getting in our way.
ls this some kind of joke?
278
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,190
Plus, he uses people as scapegoats
and shields.
279
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,930
He thinks it’s only natural for
Shinobi to die in missions.
280
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,600
I can’t take this anymore!
281
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,300
Me neither.
lf it comes to this, then I’m…
282
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,800
– …gonna use Rasengan!
– …gonna use Gatsuuga!
283
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,270
– And beat up this client up so bad!
– And beat up this client up so bad!
284
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,110
Next time:
“The Weight of The Prized Artifact!”
//%
1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:13,860
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,540
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,230
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,800
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,900
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,130
Our two hearts
11
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Stop!
12
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,720
D-Don’t push my father around!
13
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,860
You idiot, Fuki. Get out of here!
14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,460
What’re you hesitating for?
Take care of him quickly.
15
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,560
That’s your job, right?
16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,930
Get out of my way.
17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,540
Fuki!
18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,170
You’ve got something nice there.
19
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,940
I’ll take that.
20
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,540
Please spare my daughter!
21
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,740
Like I care!
22
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,050
Father…
23
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,720
Father! Father!
24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,720
Stop it!
25
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,630
Y-You jerk.
26
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,550
Here.
27
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,820
It’s okay.
28
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,670
Look out!
29
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,720
Just a little more…
Just a little more, believe it.
30
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,030
Rare menma pickled bamboo shoots?
31
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,360
Right. But only if I can get my hands
on it when it’s in rare bamboo state.
32
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,740
It seems the rare bamboo only grows
on some ungodly cliff…
33
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,540
Then I’ll get it, no matter what.
34
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,210
And then I’ll eat some Ichiraku ramen
with the rare pickled bamboo shoots on top…
35
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,310
No matter what, believe it!
36
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,750
Rare pickled bamboo shoots.
37
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,050
I did it!
38
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,560
I’m saved.
39
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,590
Huh?
40
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,060
What is that?
41
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,200
It’s a person!
42
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,280
Vanished Memories
43
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,720
To think there’d be thunder
even though it’s not raining…
44
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,550
It’s kind of eerie.
45
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,590
You shouldn’t shout like that…
46
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,300
This is a hospital.
47
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,230
You made me shout.
48
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,570
Huh? That white coat.
49
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,540
Could it be that you’re helping out
the Medical Team, Sakura?
50
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,770
Isn’t it lovely? I finally got the white coat.
51
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,010
I see. It’s great that you were here
just at the right time.
52
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,550
I’ve got someone I’d like you
to take a look at.
53
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,380
Someone you want me
to take a look at?
54
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,920
It’s him.
55
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,220
Wh-What? Could that be Dozaemon…?
56
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,560
His name’s Dozaemon, huh…?
57
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,960
I didn’t think he was
your acquaintance Sakura.
58
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,460
No. Dozaemon is a drowned body…
59
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,960
Oh, never mind…
60
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,560
I thought I knew him, but I was mistaken.
61
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,570
I see. Then I leave him to you.
62
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,100
Hey, this is a Leaf hospital.
63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,540
So people outside of the village
can’t be admitted.
64
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,210
Come on, just do this for me.
65
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,540
I’ve got other business to attend to.
So I leave the rest to you.
66
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,710
Oh, hey, Naruto! Hold it!
67
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,550
This is indeed the rare bamboo
I’ve heard about.
68
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,560
Yeah, now I can eat the rare ramen!
69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
What’re you talking about?
70
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,690
It takes three or four weeks to make
71
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,900
the pickled bamboo shoots
out of the rare bamboo.
72
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,200
What?!
73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,270
First, I boil this
and then ferment it slowly.
74
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,470
What, I can’t eat it right away?!
75
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,610
You need a degree of determination
to eat delicious things.
76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Naruto, so this is where you were.
77
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,510
Hey, what’s up with you?
78
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,550
What’s up, nothing, you jerk…
79
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,680
Oww!
80
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,750
So you force a strange patient on me
81
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,090
and intend to eat ramen
by yourself at your leisure?
82
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,550
Ouch. That hurts.
83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,970
Back to the Past Jutsu!
84
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,540
Oh, what’s he doing there?
85
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,480
He’s probing into his memory
from his subconscious.
86
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,550
That reverse hypnosis thing, huh?
87
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,550
Right.
88
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,480
Have you remembered anything?
89
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,560
I see.
90
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,560
It seems he’s lost his memory.
91
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,330
Lost his memory?
92
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,130
Let’s call it a day.
We’ll do more tomorrow.
93
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,540
It seems he doesn’t remember anything.
94
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,540
Not his name or address…
95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,540
If none the doctor’s Jutsu don’t work,
then this is the real deal.
96
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,440
Then, doesn’t he have something
we could use to identify him?
97
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,550
Nope… This is all he had.
98
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,850
What’s this?
99
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,460
It’s a dove flute, also called an ocarina.
100
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,260
Ocarina?
101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,890
It’s broken, though.
102
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,860
Oh, it looks like this will stick.
103
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,130
Not having memory could also
be a temporary state of shock…
104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,570
Anyway, you sign this.
105
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,840
What’s this?
106
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,500
A letter of undertaking.
107
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,640
I told you earlier,
but this is a Leaf hospital.
108
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,080
Outsiders aren’t allowed.
109
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,940
If something were to happen,
110
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,010
you will take responsibility
for everything, Naruto.
111
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,210
What?!
112
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,980
You got a problem?
113
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,850
Fine, okay.
114
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,250
I sure picked up something troublesome.
115
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,760
What’s going on?!
116
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,130
That’s in the direction of the hospital!
117
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,070
Everyone, it’ll be okay.
Please evacuate calmly.
118
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,630
Help me!
119
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,130
Forgive me… Forgive me.
120
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,670
Is there anyone left?
121
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,540
Anyone here?
122
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,320
Sakura, did you evacuate everyone?
123
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,150
I’m checking right now.
124
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,990
Hey, Sakura!
125
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,720
Naruto.
126
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,260
Everything okay?
127
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,360
Somehow.
128
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,960
Hey, where is that guy?
129
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,560
What?
130
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,030
Come to think of it…
131
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,860
He’s not here.
132
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,840
Please help! My baby is…
My baby is still inside!
133
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
What did you say?!
134
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,440
No way. It doesn’t look like
we can get in with these flames…
135
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,610
What’re you doing?!
Hurry up and put out the fire!
136
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,470
I’ll go in!
137
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,410
That’s reckless.
138
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,880
The baby is in the deepest part
of the hospital.
139
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,550
What?
140
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,980
It’s the sound of a flute.
141
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,990
It's him!
142
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,560
He’s getting closer.
143
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,190
Here he comes!
144
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,560
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
145
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,300
– This way! 					– To the right.
146
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,500
He did it! The baby is with him, too!
147
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,570
All right!
148
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,670
My boy!
149
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,810
That was a close shave.
150
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,710
Thank goodness!
151
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,440
Thank you very much…Thank you!
152
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,550
Sure.
153
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,420
Thank you so much.
154
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,090
An outsider with amnesia, huh?
155
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,760
Good grief. What a dilemma.
156
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,860
It’d be okay just to let
that one guy stay, right?
157
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,300
We can’t do that.
158
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,930
For the safety of the village,
159
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,740
we must not overlook even
the slightest thing.
160
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,940
But, we figured out that
161
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,610
he’s not a bad guy
after that incident, right?
162
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,750
Unfortunately, we must not let someone
whose identity we don’t know
163
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,250
stay in the village.
164
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,880
Then, if he were to do something,
165
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,820
I’ll take the responsibility
and figure something out.
166
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,050
Sakura, how’s he doing?
Has he remembered anything?
167
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,560
No, nothing yet.
168
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,360
I see.
169
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,500
I’m begging you.
I’ll let you guys have some of
170
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,230
the rare pickled bamboo
shoot ramen too, Grandma.
171
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,600
Rare…pickled bamboo shoots?
172
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,540
Yeah. I went to pick some on
the way back from a mission
173
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,640
and then found him--!
174
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,010
That’s news to me.
175
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,610
So you were loitering around like
that on your way back from a mission?
176
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,910
Ouch. Oww.
177
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,990
Naruto, so you’re serious about
looking after that boy, huh?
178
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,590
Yeah, it’s true.
179
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,560
All right, then I’ll let that boy
remain in the village.
180
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,890
Lady Tsunade!
181
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,930
I can’t run out the person
who saved a child from this village.
182
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,540
Excellent, Grandma.
Now you’re talking!
183
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,540
I’m Naruto Uzumaki…
Nice to know you.
184
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,810
I-I’m…
185
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,480
Oh, that’s right.
Your memory hasn’t come back yet.
186
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,720
Then, hmmm.
187
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,220
Menma, make it Menma.
188
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,760
Menma?
189
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,960
Yeah. I’d gone to pick some
and then I found you, so…
190
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,690
Menma…
191
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,760
Okay, got it. My name’s Menma.
192
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,970
It’s settled. Nice to meet you, Menma.
193
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,140
Good to meet you, Naruto.
194
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,670
Here you go.
195
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,570
Wow, it looks delicious.
196
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,540
The ramen here is the best
in the world, believe it.
197
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,550
Let’s eat.
198
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,850
Tasty.
199
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,560
But this isn’t the finished product.
Don’t you notice something lacking?
200
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,560
Huh?
201
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,460
Oh.
202
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,430
Come to think of it, there isn’t
any menma pickled bamboo shoots on top.
203
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,400
Right. Until the rare pickled
bamboo shoots are ready,
204
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,840
they’re sealed from your ramen.
205
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,670
Hey, old man, you’ll be
sure to make it, right?
206
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,310
Absolutely.
207
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,540
I can’t wait. Say, Menma.
208
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,550
Let’s definitely come here together
to have some at that time.
209
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,510
Right.
210
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,820
Okay, come on in.
211
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,090
Excuse me for barging in.
212
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,160
As of today, this is your home.
213
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,260
It’s a dirty place,
but make yourself comfortable.
214
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Whoa.
215
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,360
It really is dirty.
216
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,670
Don’t get so hung up on the details.
217
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,900
Y-You’re right.
218
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,440
More importantly, let’s get to sleep and
219
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,880
starting tomorrow we’ll come up with
a way to get your memory back.
220
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,810
Right.
221
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,550
I can’t eat anymore…
222
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,670
Man, I slept well!
223
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,510
Morning, Naruto.
224
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,340
Menma?
225
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,750
Whoa.
226
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,610
Everything’s been cleaned up nicely!
227
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,880
Did you do this?
228
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,750
Yeah. I couldn’t sleep and
had time to kill.
229
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,860
Thanks for that…
230
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,230
Hey, Menma! What’re you doing?!
231
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,060
What do you mean?
I’m hanging up the laundry.
232
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,930
Don’t wash someone else’s underwear!
233
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,470
I’ll do that myself,
so don’t worry about it!
234
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,800
Really?
235
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,510
Now then…
How should we get your memory back?
236
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,750
Oh, I know!
237
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,550
Come with me, Menma.
238
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,760
This is a specialty from the Land of Wind,
Sand Dumplings.
239
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,400
This fine soy powder is used to
resemble sand and they taste really good.
240
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Yeah?
241
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,570
And this one is a specialty from
the Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes.
242
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,300
The crunchy texture is irresistible.
243
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,400
Uh-huh.
244
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,340
And this is a specialty from
the Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans.
245
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,540
So? Have you remembered anything?
246
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,550
No… Nothing at all.
247
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,980
Oh, I thought you might
remember something
248
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,550
if they had a specialty
from your home.
249
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,550
Sorry.
250
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,550
No need to apologize.
251
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,390
Naruto, forget about my memory.
252
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,560
What?
253
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,430
You see, we don’t know how
or when my memory will come back.
254
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,540
More importantly,
you’ve got your own work, right?
255
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,300
Well, you’ve got a point.
256
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,540
I’ve got to finish cleaning
the Great Stone Faces by today…
257
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,140
Then let’s do that.
258
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,310
But before that, wait just a minute.
259
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,510
Huh?
260
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,820
Hey, Menma.
261
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,180
Ma’am…
262
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I’ll carry your things
to your house.
263
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,320
Oh, thank you.
264
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,830
Thank you very much.
265
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,400
No problem.
266
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,610
At any rate, you’ve sure got
a lot of weeds growing in your yard.
267
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,540
My lower back has been
bothering me lately…
268
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,250
The grass grows as much as it wants.
269
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,350
Then I’ll do it.
270
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,550
Oh, my.
271
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,550
I-I will, too!
272
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,560
Thanks so much!
273
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,360
Phew… Finally done!
274
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,500
Naruto.
275
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
What is it?
276
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,000
They want help too!
277
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,770
Huh?
278
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,570
It seems this area here
is all homes of the elderly.
279
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Thanks.
280
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
I leave it to you.
281
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
F-For real?
282
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,710
What’s this?
283
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,380
Actually, thank-you gifts have
been sent to Naruto and that boy
284
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,020
from all over the village.
285
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,850
What’re those two doing?
286
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,630
But really, you’re sure an odd guy.
287
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,790
Am I?
288
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,560
You’ve got a strong
sense of righteousness,
289
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,230
I mean,
you’re the embodiment of kindness.
290
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,600
It’s not something easily done.
291
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,440
I just want to live right.
292
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,540
I don’t want to have any more regrets.
293
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,110
Hm? Menma,
have you remembered something?
294
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,950
Huh? No, not really.
295
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,510
I see.
296
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,980
What?! Is it bird poop?
297
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,650
It’s blood!
298
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,930
Give me a hand, Menma!
299
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,000
Right!
300
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,800
What’s the matter?!
301
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,840
Someone…in this village…
302
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,510
Let’s get out of here!
303
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,010
Menma, I leave this guy to you.
304
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,880
Got it.
305
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,720
Damn it!
306
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,000
Damn you. Come on out!
307
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,540
Damn it! Where’s he hiding?
308
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,910
Naruto…
309
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,490
Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?!
310
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,560
Huh? What’s this…?
311
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,500
Awesome power’s starting to
well up in my whole body.
312
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,770
All right.
313
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,310
Awesome!
314
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,840
Power’s flowing over me!
315
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,550
I see you.
316
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,990
Damn it.
317
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,290
I did it.
318
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,570
It’s a Substitution!
319
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,470
Damn it. He got away, huh…?
320
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,810
You okay, Naruto?
321
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,510
Menma…
322
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,510
That flute just now…
323
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,420
Who in the world are you?
324
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,560
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
325
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,800
Will always be smiling right near by
326
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,580
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
327
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,310
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
328
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,220
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
329
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,060
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
330
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,000
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
331
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,400
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
332
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,700
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
333
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:15,210
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
334
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,120
The wind is probably testing our hearts
335
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,420
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
336
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,560
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
337
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,430
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
338
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,070
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
339
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,210
Will always be smiling right near by
340
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,680
As I thought, he’s no ordinary man.
341
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,920
He won’t be an easy opponent to fight.
342
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,250
Wait a minute.
343
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,820
You are talking about Menma
like his our enemy or something.
344
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,560
There is that possibility, you know.
345
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
He could be with the intruder
from the other day.
346
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,690
What are you talking about?
347
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,930
Weren't you two gonna help us
seek Menma's memory together?
348
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,600
Our mission is to find out
the guy's identity
349
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,870
and to catch the intruder.
350
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,100
Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.
351
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,210
Next time: "Bringing Back Reality"
//%
1
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,760
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:29,590
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,970
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,140
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,300
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,850
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,720
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,010
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:18,680
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,640
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,760
The Beast Within
13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,260
Sasuke!
14
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,300
Why…?!
15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,010
Why do you run away?!
16
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,050
Sasuke!
17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,350
Don’t…
18
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,260
be staring at…
19
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,590
people!
20
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,600
He’s faster than earlier!
21
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,970
The medicine from earlier…
22
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,720
Was there some kind of
special ingredient in it or something…?
23
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,050
Not…bad…
24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,510
Moving around kind of…
made me feel super weird…
25
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,390
Oh, my…!
26
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,010
What was that…all of a sudden…?
27
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,800
Did he really…fall asleep…?
28
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,600
You fell for it, eh?!
29
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,930
It looked like I was sleeping,
but actually I wasn’t!
30
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,550
This is the Shinobi secret…!
31
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,180
Guy Sensei…I did it!
32
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,180
Guy Sensei…I…I…
33
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,350
You fell for it yet again, huh?!
Hey!
34
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,350
You’re sorely mistaken
if you think I’m the kind of person
35
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,590
to sleep spread-eagle
in a place like this!
36
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,680
I…I…
37
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,600
What…? What am I doing
in a place like this…?
38
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,510
What…?
39
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,220
Why…? Why…?
40
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,300
Alcohol…?
41
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,220
He’s just drunk, huh…?
42
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,350
If so…I’ll send you to another world
before you can even feel pain…
43
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,430
Damn it…
I don’t have enough Chakra…
44
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,590
At this rate…
45
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,680
As might be expected,
things will get hairy
46
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,590
if I stay in the water any longer
with this wound…
47
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,590
Why won’t it hit?!
48
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,350
And here I was sleeping comfortably…
49
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,100
You’re a buzzing, annoying fly!
50
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,390
Hey! Bring it on! Hey c’mon…
I’ll show you…
51
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,590
What’re…those movements…?
52
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,140
As you know, in that technique…
53
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,220
one gets stronger the more one drinks
and the more one gets drunk.
54
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,010
I know…
55
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,970
At the restaurant before…
56
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,100
When Lee mistook it for water
and drank a small cup of alcohol…
57
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,600
It took Neji and me, the both of us,
to finally…be able to overpower Lee.
58
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,050
You couldn’t restrain him yourself…?
59
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,100
I could overpower him
if I was fighting him as an enemy…
60
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,590
But well, I couldn’t inflict a serious injury
on my beloved student…
61
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,590
That’s right…
62
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,050
That’s how it was
just with one small cup, so…
63
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,760
If he were to drink
an entire bottle of alcohol…
64
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,970
An invincible strength, huh…?
65
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,720
But it’s just after
he got out of the hospital.
66
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,680
How long will his body
hold on for…?
67
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,430
A Loopy Fist User, huh…?
lt’s my first time seeing one…
68
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,010
If you’re not going to come…
then I’ll go!
69
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,140
His attacks are straight as usual…
70
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,550
Oh!
71
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,470
Ouch!
72
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,010
It’s your fault!
73
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,760
I…I…!
74
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,590
I’m enjoying my youth!
75
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,590
He’s too unorthodox…
76
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,470
And most of all…he’s fast!
77
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,590
Right in the middle of my youth…
78
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,140
Dance of the Camellia!
79
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,590
Here!
80
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,100
I can’t read his movements…
81
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,140
An attack on me…
That’s quite some Taijutsu…
82
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,100
I have no choice…
83
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,590
My attack ability is bones…
84
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,590
You heard that earlier
from the Clone brat, right…?
85
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,350
I’ll sober you up right away.
86
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,590
I’m…not drunk…or anything!
87
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,600
Then I’ll wake you up!
88
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,930
I’m not drunk or anything!
89
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,850
In the first place, I’m a minor!
90
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,970
Minors shouldn’t drink at all!
91
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,590
Unorthodox, isn’t it…?
This is my Kekkei Genkai.
92
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,850
Calm down…Think of a strategy…
93
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,590
Seek…some kind of possibility…
94
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,390
Humph. With that wound…
95
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,350
It seems he wasn’t able
to escape very far at all…
96
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,220
This is my limit…
I can’t move…
97
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,850
Damn it…
He’s already caught up?
98
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,680
And…
99
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,590
My head’s pounding…
100
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,260
And what’s with this wound…?
101
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,140
It seems I was drunk, eh…?
102
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,930
Your appearance…!
103
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,010
It seems you’ve sobered up…
This is my Kekkei Genkai…
104
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,050
Kekkei Genkai…
105
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,800
My Kekkei Genkai freely controls
osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells…
106
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,140
It even controls the concentration
of calcium. It's an ability to form bones.
107
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,930
Basically, there are over two hundred
bones in the human body…
108
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,890
But for me, that’s not a set number.
109
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,590
But bones are bones, after all!
110
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,600
If they break, they break!
111
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,850
Wh-What a hardness…!
112
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,430
Are these really human bones…?!
113
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,050
If so…!
114
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,300
Larch Dance.
115
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,350
I’ve had it…
116
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,640
A little more…you clod.
117
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,350
It’s not like the time before with Asuma…
118
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,140
A-Asuma!
119
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:45,140
There’s probably zero possibility
of someone coming to help...
120
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,850
Hey, what’s the point of thinking
about someone helping…?!
121
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,760
Calm down!
122
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,550
The smell is moving away…
123
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,590
I’m saved…
124
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,510
Who is?
125
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,590
How…?!
126
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,550
I knew it…
127
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,800
My coat?!
128
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,590
It seems you didn’t notice your own smell
that you’re routinely used to smelling…
129
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,640
With that you erased your own smell?
130
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:22,550
You understand well the attributes of scent.
lt figures why I didn’t smell you.
131
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
And…as would be expected,
132
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,890
it’s tough having you guys split up in two
to search for me…
133
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,510
Damn it…
134
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,640
Please wait!
135
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,260
The real deal…is from now!
136
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,590
My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible…
137
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,100
So, I should’ve avoided a big technique
that could be self-defeating…
138
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,220
But it seems this isn’t an opponent
easy enough to be able to beat
139
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,930
without using my Secret Technique…
140
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,590
Here I go!
141
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,590
I just had surgery
and am not at my best.
142
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,350
But if it’d just be opening the first of the
Eight Inner Gates, The Gate of Opening,
143
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,850
I should somehow…
144
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,100
The first gate… Gate of Opening…
145
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,510
Open!
146
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,590
Primary Lotus!
147
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,930
The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones…?!
148
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,590
That’s some speed… But it’s over.
149
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,800
Damn it… No matter how much I think,
I can’t come up with any good strategies!
150
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,600
I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…
151
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,510
With me right in front of you,
you can’t even howl like a loser…?
152
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,970
Eh?!
153
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,590
Die!
154
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,850
You’re mine!
155
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,590
Don’t you be smiling
before you’re going to die!
156
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,720
What?!
157
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,640
Who’re you?!
158
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,590
Heh… It seems
you’re an ally this time…
159
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,640
Who’re you?!
160
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,590
A Sand…
161
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,180
Shinobi…
162
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,470
ally of the Leaf!
163
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,590
For the first time, I spoke to you
164
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,640
And you smiled
165
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,180
For the first time, I was able to speak
166
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,050
In my own words
167
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,600
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
168
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,260
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
169
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,850
My clumsy attempts with words
170
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,590
You listened without turning away
171
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,800
No wonder I get carried away by you
172
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,890
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
173
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,140
I feel so sad
174
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,100
But…
175
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,470
For the first time, I spoke to you
176
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,590
And you smiled
177
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,050
For the first time, I was able to speak
178
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,470
In my own words
179
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,600
For the first time, I spoke to you
180
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,100
And you smiled
181
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,590
For the first time, I was able to speak
182
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,590
In my own words
183
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,260
For the first time, I spoke to you
184
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,590
I heard that the Sand and Leaf
had made up, but…
185
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,050
It wasn’t that we attacked the Leaf Village
for the fun of it.
186
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,220
It was just a mission, same as this time.
187
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,800
Humph! I see.
188
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,800
By the way, weren’t you three
headed this way together?
189
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,890
We had no choice.
Since you guys are weak…
190
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,850
Idiot. Don’t take them lightly.
These guys are out of the ordinary.
191
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,260
Next episode,
“The Sand Shinobi: Allies of the Leaf”
//%
1
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,490
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,410
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,950
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,490
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,200
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:46,080
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:55,490
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:06,330
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:15,660
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,830
What were you gazing at?
10.01	02:16:44:04	02:16:49:17	                    Infiltration: The Set-Up!
11
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,540
How is she?
12
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,700
I don’t know why
she suddenly collapsed…
13
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,410
I see.
14
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,660
The collection ships depart
in the morning.
15
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,370
We should get back to the inn.
16
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,120
But then,
what will happen to Isaribi?
17
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,290
Who cares?
She’s the Demon of the Ocean!
18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,750
But…
19
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,000
Naruto, what in the world happened
with you and that girl?
20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,080
Aw c’mon! I told you
a little while ago, she saved me!
21
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,540
What happened?
22
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,290
Sorry, my hand slipped.
23
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,200
I see.
24
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,620
I’ll clean this up right away.
25
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,750
Anko.
26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,830
Yes?
27
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,750
The studies here,
the Hokage knows about them.
28
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,500
I understand.
29
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,120
So, you’re saying that this girl
named Isaribi saved you?
30
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,580
Yeah, I owe my life to her.
31
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,830
Even if that’s so, there’s no doubt
that this girl named Isaribi
32
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,200
was one of the people
who attacked us.
33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,160
Our mission is to protect
the government’s money
34
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,750
and catch the Demon of the Ocean.
35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,910
That’s right, and no matter
how you look at it,
36
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,450
there’s no doubt that
she’s the Demon of the Ocean!
37
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,330
Yeah, but I think there’s some reason
for all that.
38
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,700
I’m going to follow her and--!
39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,250
You’re talking nonsense.
40
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,160
Besides, even if we were to follow her,
we've got no idea where she is.
41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,700
No, I have one.
42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,490
Really, Shino?
43
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,790
It’s something I heard.
44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,490
It seems there’s one island
in this country
45
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,490
that played a central role in a series
of spiriting away incidents.
46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
Where is it?!
47
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,040
A deserted island where
the Demon of the Ocean lives,
48
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,200
Demon Island.
49
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,490
Demon Island?
50
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,200
Sensei, are you doing okay?
51
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,540
Yes, more importantly,
52
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,540
there’s something I want to tell you
about the Demon of the Ocean.
53
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,490
The true identity of this thing called
the Demon of the Ocean
54
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,490
is a human whose flesh
has been altered.
55
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,490
What?!
56
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,330
What did you say?
57
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,330
Don’t muck things up like that again.
58
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,490
Yes sir.
59
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,200
She's out, the monster!
60
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,080
What the…?
61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,490
– Get out of here.
– You're bad luck.
62
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,790
Take this!
63
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,990
She's the one who was spirited away.
64
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,570
And why would she be
the only one who came back?
65
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,280
What are you talking about?
66
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,490
A spiriting away that occurred
ten years ago in the Land of Sea,
67
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,950
but that was not the working
of a demon.
68
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,350
Orochimaru kidnapped humans
to use as live subjects
69
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,590
for his research at the time.
70
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,850
Orochimaru…
71
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,800
Is Orochimaru mixed up
in this current matter?
72
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,590
Wait a minute.
Orochimaru and tests!
73
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,350
Why are you suddenly
saying such things?
74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,970
I have to explain it to you from
when Orochimaru left the village.
75
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,800
Over ten years ago,
76
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,590
Orochimaru’s desire to satisfy his own
inquiring mind and further his power
77
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,680
was such that he gradually
exceeded the scope of a Shinobi
78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,300
and in the end, got involved in developing
what are called Forbidden Jutsu.
79
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,760
How unfortunate.
80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,590
Naturally, this soon became
known to the village.
81
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,220
After Orochimaru!
82
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Stop that guy!
83
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,470
But Orochimaru, who traveled
in and out of country on missions…
84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,850
had several other private facilities
outside of the Leaf Village…
85
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,100
So one of those is on Demon Island?
86
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,760
So, the people who disappeared?
87
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,260
They were used for
human experiments.
88
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,930
What?
89
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,100
Damn Orochimaru!
What does he think people are?
90
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,720
So, what are we going to do?
91
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,590
It’s obvious, isn’t it?
We get into their hideout!
92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,350
And we have to get
lsaribi back!
93
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,800
It’s settled.
94
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,680
We’ll continue and hit
the Demon of the Ocean’s hideout.
95
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,390
Sensei, how long have you known
about Demon Island?
96
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,640
It’s because Orochimaru
was the Jonin in charge of me.
97
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,590
Huh?
98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,220
Tell me when we get close
to the island.
99
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,300
The pain is gradually getting stronger.
100
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,100
Somebody’s coming.
101
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,590
What shall we do?
102
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,140
Do as you please.
103
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,260
Yes.
104
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,590
The arrogance…
One day I’ll pay him back!
105
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,550
This way.
106
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,600
Hurry!
107
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,890
How is it, Shino?
108
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,220
No problem.
109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,590
Okay!
110
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,590
So, a collection ship
is on the move, huh?
111
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,850
Just the right time.
112
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,390
Good work, I was right to send you
back to Mother Island.
113
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,010
What’s wrong? You’re pale.
114
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,800
When will I return to normal?
115
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,720
Like you said, I’ve gathered
information about the ships
116
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,850
from the market
and the village, even the attacks.
117
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,300
So…
118
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,050
What are you bringing up, Isaribi?
119
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,600
You can’t possibly have forgotten
your role as a prototype.
120
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,510
As a converted body,
your cooperation in generating data…
121
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,100
That was one
of the conditions of the promise.
122
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,680
Don’t worry, we’ll soon be done
getting data from you.
123
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,720
I’ll keep the promise…
as long as I don’t change my mind.
124
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,300
You understand, right?
125
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,590
Yes.
126
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,390
Well, if you understand,
go keep our guests company.
127
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,590
I understand…
128
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,220
You’re vicious, too.
129
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,800
There’s no sign of ‘em.
130
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,590
What is this?
131
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,640
Birds, no fish?
132
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,350
Don’t move!
133
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,510
Too bad, isn’t it?
134
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,180
Don’t mess with Shinobi
from the Leaf Village.
134.01	02:26:06:15	02:26:07:19	You, little…!
135
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,300
Well, well,
aren’t these cute kitties?
136
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,590
Is everyone okay?
137
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,680
Yep.
138
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,590
As always, you people
are addicted to peace.
139
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,930
You’re from last evening!
140
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,720
Your face looks familiar.
141
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,590
The Chunin Exams,
if I remember correctly.
142
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,180
That’s right…
143
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,350
As I recall, Sasuke’s adversary!
144
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,140
The guy who was with
that Kabuto?!
145
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,590
You are correct…
146
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,220
Of course,
I haven’t seen him since then.
147
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,010
You used a strange Jutsu
to suck up other’s Chakras.
148
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,590
You’re the guy who sucked up
all of Sasuke’s strength.
149
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,720
Well, all of you, come at me.
I’m different than I was then.
150
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,220
Okay, I’ll finish you off right now!
151
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,890
Wait, Naruto!
152
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,050
Shino?
153
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,550
You go ahead.
Seems like I’m the opponent for him.
154
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,590
Huh?
155
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,890
His Jutsu is not suited for
your style of close combat.
156
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,260
We can’t have all three of us stay here.
157
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,180
All right.
158
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,590
– We’re counting on you, Shino!
– Be careful!
159
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,300
Wait!
160
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,800
Parasitic Insects, eh?
161
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,050
Found ‘im!
162
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,220
Who?
163
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,680
Welcome, or should I say,
haven’t seen you in a while?
164
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,590
It’s you, Amachi.
165
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,590
I’m surprised!
166
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,260
I can’t believe you’ve come back
after something like that happened…
167
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Like what?
168
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,140
You don’t remember?
169
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,590
Sorry, but I have no business
with you…
170
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,430
Where is Orochimaru?
171
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,640
Orochimaru?
172
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,720
Don’t play dumb.
He’s here, isn’t he?
173
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,590
A Curse Mark responds even
though the operator isn’t around…
174
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,590
Stuff like that happens huh?
175
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,390
True, Orochimaru was here…
176
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,680
But that was over half a month ago.
177
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,300
No way.
178
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,550
It doesn’t matter if you don’t
believe me.
179
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,220
So the pain I felt so far…
180
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,350
has been the influence of Orochimaru’s
presence here half a month ago?
181
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,510
Wait a minute.
182
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,970
Sensei!
183
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,180
You two!
184
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,590
Oh my, you brought Genin.
185
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,890
Anko, you’re all grown up…
186
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,470
Who is that?
187
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,140
Amachi… a Medical Ninja
who partnered with Orochimaru,
188
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,260
and was running
various experiments here.
189
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,800
Orochimaru’s not here.
This whole incident was all his doing.
190
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,300
Him?!
191
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,260
Hey you! How dare you run
those ridiculous tests!
192
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,050
Ridiculous? This is no joke,
I’ve devoted my life to this research.
193
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,300
What was that?!
194
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,890
Look! This one has the physical ability
to adapt to water.
195
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,590
She combines the ability
to breathe underwater
196
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,390
and the muscle strength
to move freely and quickly.
197
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,850
It’s been a dream of mine
for many years,
198
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,220
to form a Ninja corps
for underwater combat.
199
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,590
This is the first step.
200
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,140
A Ninja corps for underwater combat?
201
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,760
That’s right, a military corps able
to move freely underwater
202
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,260
that the common person
definitely could not imitate.
203
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,970
When that happens,
we can divide land and land
204
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,680
and completely control
marine shipping routes!
205
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,720
Wonderful, is it not?
206
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,350
With this strength,
I’ll stand on top of the world.
207
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,890
And I’ll make Orochimaru regret
abandoning this research.
208
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,640
People are not your tools!
209
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,050
Oh my, you're so young,
210
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,470
you don’t understand the greatness
of this research…
211
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,350
Well, you’re average guinea pigs
who don’t know any better,
212
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,850
so I don’t think I want you to understand.
213
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,930
Bastard!
214
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,600
That’s good, Isaribi.
215
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,550
Out of the way, Isaribi!
216
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,930
No!
217
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,430
What’s wrong? You can’t fight
by just running around in circles.
218
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,800
Damn it!
219
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,760
Why are you protecting that guy?
220
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,010
That guy did this to you, Isaribi!
221
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,850
Yeah, but…!
222
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,050
But it can’t be helped.
223
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,220
This is the only person who can
return my body back to normal.
224
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,350
He promised.
225
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,930
Look.
226
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,850
Isaribi…
227
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,590
People are judged based solely
on their appearance.
228
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,640
People don’t dare come near me
just from being covered in bandages……
229
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,100
A monster with these scales
would be out of the question.
230
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,220
I want to return to my former body,
I want to be a human!
231
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,220
For that reason,
I decided I’d do anything!
232
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,970
You’re a human being even now, Isaribi!
233
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,600
Huh?!
234
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,600
And yet you join with those guys
to attack and sink ships.
235
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,140
Isn’t that far more like something
a monster would do?!
236
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,930
Stop it, shut up!
237
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,390
I-I…
238
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,590
I don’t want to hear it!
Shut up, shut up!
239
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,720
Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?
240
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,590
No… I-I’m the same as you!
241
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,180
You’re lying!
242
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,010
What are you talking about?
You’re a normal human.
243
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,140
I want to be like you too!
244
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,390
Don’t cry Isaribi…
I’ll properly return you to normal.
245
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,010
Watch out!
246
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,590
A bulls-eye letter bomb.
247
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,970
Thanks to Isaribi doing a good job
of attracting your attention.
248
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,140
S-Sensei…
249
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,680
I’ll leave the rest to you.
250
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,720
Okay.
251
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,590
Let’s go, Isaribi.
252
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,100
Wait!
253
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,590
Don’t go, Isaribi!
254
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,550
Damn it!
255
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,850
We’d better take care of
this right away.
256
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,800
Give it up… It’s over.
257
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,890
We’ll make you a guinea pig
for Amachi, too.
258
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,260
Insect clone?!
259
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,350
We’re the same
Chakra-eating colleagues, after all.
260
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,510
It won’t be easy to finish a fight.
261
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,430
He disappeared?
262
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,930
What is he thinking?
263
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,930
There you go!
264
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,890
Naruto!
265
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,350
I’m going to strangle you
to death like this.
266
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,590
What--?!
267
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,050
Mind Destruction Jutsu, a success.
268
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,680
All right, you did it, Ino!
269
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,590
Damn it!
Let me go, let me go!
270
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,390
That’s dirty of you!
271
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,180
What are you talking about?
272
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,350
There are no such things as
being too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.
273
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,590
And you call yourself a Ninja?
274
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,050
Shut up!
275
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,220
What?
276
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,680
This place is collapsing.
277
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,890
They’re planning to take care
of us along with the building.
278
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,390
Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me!
279
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,590
Hurry, the entrance is
already useless.
280
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,890
I thought this place would
be traced soon.
281
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,590
It’s an old building,
282
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,850
but a damn good tomb
for the likes of them.
283
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,590
One person didn’t make it in time?
284
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh well, doesn’t have much of an influence
on attacking a collection ship.
285
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,140
Damn! Where’s the exit?!
286
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,300
The wind blows, Ah…
287
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,050
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
288
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,590
What should be brought along?
289
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,590
Assemble them into a piece.
290
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,640
There is no second chance, never
291
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,350
How foolish it is to throw away
292
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
293
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,510
The images.
294
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,590
It probably will not end
295
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,850
It probably will not end
296
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,600
Burn that love-filled heart,
297
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,680
Sail across a thousand dreams
298
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,720
Running freely
299
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,510
To take hold of the world in hand
300
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
The clouds scatter
301
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,590
The sun sets yet again
302
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,100
The solo parade begins to move.
303
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,430
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
304
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,800
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
305
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Well, where’s the exit, Shino?!
306
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,590
How should I know?
307
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,850
Then, what do we do, Ino?!
308
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,100
We just have to stop complaining
and run!
309
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,890
But I don’t see an exit at all!
310
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,760
It seems the exit has collapsed.
311
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,760
– What?! 					– What?!
312
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,590
Are we going to be buried alive?!
313
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,720
– No!
– Since it's come to this…
314
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,100
– I’ll use my Rasengan!
– What're you doing?
315
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,590
– How can you be calm?!
– Oh, shut up!
316
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,850
You guys step back a little!
317
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,590
Next time: “Despair: A Fractured Heart.”
//%
1
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,490
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,290
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,830
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,490
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,080
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,950
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:55,410
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:06,200
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:15,540
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,700
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,450
Kakashi Sensei…
12
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,870
The mission in the Land of Birds
is over…
13
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,500
That is enough.
14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,040
But, then what about Naruto…?
15
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,080
As the leader,
I am responsible for all of this.
16
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,040
Sacrifice is an unavoidable part
of Shinobi missions…
17
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,120
Now…
18
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,490
Let’s go back to our village!
19
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,200
Do you think they’re really going back
to their village, Nagare?
20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,080
Perhaps…
21
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,250
But I’m concerned about that masked guy
who joined up with them later…
22
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,620
Shall I follow him, Hokushin?
23
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,490
No, I’ll do that.
You give the report.
24
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,490
All right…
25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,870
The Death of Naruto
26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,620
How did things turn out…?
27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,160
The two as well as the one
who joined up with them later…
28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,910
seem to have crossed the border
29
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,490
and are heading for
the Village Hidden in Leaves.
30
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,490
I see.
31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,790
And it seems Lord Sagi
took care
32
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,490
of the one who infiltrated the residence
of the feudal lord.
33
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,450
Very nice indeed.
34
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,490
What’re they doing there
for the past hour…?
35
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,540
P-Persimmon! 					Wh-What the--?
36
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,790
– Ouch… 					– That hurts…
37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
It couldn’t be!
38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,750
Substitution Jutsu!
Since when…?
39
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,790
They tricked me!
Those Leaf Shinobi…
40
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,410
Lord Komei… Come out.
41
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,660
Land of Birds Tactician Komei.
42
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,490
You have abused the key position
in this land of tactician
43
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,910
and committed the crime
of assassinating
44
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,490
the previous feudal lord Lord Owashi
and his child Lady Toki.
45
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
And you also ordered a subordinate
46
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,910
to run wild as the ghost
called the Cursed Warrior,
47
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,870
disturbed the public, you undermined
the government of the land,
48
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,490
endangered Lord Sagi’s position
of feudal lord
49
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,080
and attempted to attain
the position himself,
50
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,250
an unforgivable crime of treason!
51
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,750
Therefore, you are ordered
to perform seppuku!
52
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,410
I see… That explains it.
53
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,160
You ensnared me,
didn’t you, Moso?!
54
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,490
You’re disgraceful, Komei!
lf you’re a warrior, kill yourself like one!
55
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,950
Assist him with the seppuku
at once!
56
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,950
– Yes, my lord!
– Yes, my lord!
57
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,200
Is this it now…?
58
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,700
Wh-What?!
59
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,160
Hidden Mist Jutsu?
No! This is…
60
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,080
It does not matter! Kill him!
61
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,120
Yes, my lord!
62
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,040
Begging your pardon,
I shall assist!
63
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,330
Who are you?!
64
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,160
Wh-What is this?
What’s going on?!
65
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,370
– The Cursed Warrior!
– It’s the Cursed Warrior…
66
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
That’s the Cursed Warrior?!
67
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:47,950
Yes!
68
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,620
After him! Don’t let him get away!
69
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,500
– Right! 					– Right!
70
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,620
You guys go after him as is…!
71
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,330
I’ve got something
I want to look into,
72
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,540
so I’ll be going on ahead!
73
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,620
– Roger! 					– Roger!
74
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,160
I knew it!
75
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,500
You two were conspirators, right?!
76
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,330
Hold it!
77
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,870
You’re the guys from
the other night…
78
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,700
I’ve witnessed the true identity
of the ghost.
79
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,750
Who’s there?
80
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,490
Hey-hey, Komei.
81
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,620
You’re the one responsible for
controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
82
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,490
I was also attempting
to investigate
83
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,120
the true identity of
the Cursed Warrior that day…
84
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,080
I was almost sure it couldn’t
be anyone but that person…
85
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,490
What a pain! I’ll expose
the true identity here.
86
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Don’t bother…
87
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,500
Kakashi Sensei.
Where were you until now?
88
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,330
I’ll explain later.
Go on ahead!
89
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,490
Hurry! You’re going with them.
90
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,490
But…
91
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
Let’s go, Tenten!
92
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,660
Wait, Neji!
93
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Come on out…
94
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,410
You were following me
the whole time, right?
95
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,040
If that’s your intention…
96
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,490
Summoning Jutsu!
97
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,490
What is it, Kakashi?
98
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,490
Smoke out the Ninja hiding
on the temple grounds…
99
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,250
Consider it done.
100
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,830
Hey! You there…
101
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,080
Hide-and-seek is over.
Come on out now!
102
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,490
I can’t fool a dog’s nose,
as would be expected…
103
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,370
You finally grace me with
your presence, huh?
104
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,660
Why is there a hole…
in a place like this?
105
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,290
I have heard the feudal lord built
secret passages such as this
106
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,370
all over the land in order to look in
on the lives of the general public…
107
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
The feudal lord?!
108
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,370
Then that Cursed Warrior
has something to do
109
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,580
with the feudal lord…?
110
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,250
At the very least,
it seems he’s not a ghost.
111
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,490
When the time comes,
112
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,540
I’m sure he will reveal
his true identity from his end.
113
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,250
Isn’t it common sense for
hired Ninja
114
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,040
to return quietly to their village
after completing a mission?
115
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,660
It’s different in the case
116
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,290
of the premise of the commissioned
mission breaking down.
117
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,330
There were too many
suspicious points in this mission.
118
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,910
You’re sticking your nose too far
into the business of another land.
119
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,250
Here you could’ve returned safely
to your land
120
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,490
if you hadn’t secretively
sniffed around like a dog.
121
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
Excuse me for being a dog!
122
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,040
Universal Assimilation Jutsu!
123
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,490
Prepare yourself!
124
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,540
What?!
125
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,490
What is this guy?!
126
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,700
Has he introduced properties
of stone into his body?
127
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,870
Since you’ve learned of part
of this land’s secrets,
128
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,200
I can’t let you live!
129
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,490
He seems to be a somewhat
troublesome opponent.
130
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,330
Yeah. That’s good enough, Pakkun.
131
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,250
I’ll be okay by myself from here on.
132
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,120
I see… See you later!
133
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,700
Assimilation: Rock Tank.
134
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,870
I’ll crush you!
135
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,040
A Shadow Clone…?!
136
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,750
This is as far as it goes…
137
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,870
It can’t be…
138
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,040
A Paper Bomb?!
139
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,750
Now… That should be enough, right?
140
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,870
Huh?
141
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,330
Yeah… We should be okay
having come this far.
142
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,410
Th-That voice…?!
143
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,910
N-Naruto…!
144
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,870
I knew it.
145
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,490
The true identity of the Cursed Warrior
wasn’t Lord Sagi?
146
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,450
Your…
147
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,750
Your true identity is…
148
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi?
149
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,910
From the way he was standing still,
150
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,620
I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi.
151
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,250
There’s a profound reason for this…
152
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,250
What’re you doing, Tenten?!
153
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,830
Then tell me sooner!
154
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,620
It seems you also knew
it was Naruto, Neji.
155
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,660
Yeah… Ages ago.
156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,540
Jeez, you two!
157
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,870
I was really worried!
158
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,620
There was a surveillance Shinobi
following us the whole time, right?
159
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,490
Neji, Tenten…
Don’t look back.
160
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,120
We’re being followed!
161
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,120
We’re going back to
the Land of Birds.
162
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,490
Just do as I say… Got it?!
163
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,790
Y-Yes!
164
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,200
Understood…
165
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,120
But didn’t we shake the pursuer
with Substitution?
166
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,490
Yes… Once…
167
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,580
However…
168
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,080
when we chased the Cursed Warrior
from the execution grounds…
169
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,330
a different Shinobi followed us.
170
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,490
Jeez… Am I the only one
who didn’t know?
171
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,000
It was a waste to worry!
172
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,160
Then you,
in the place of Lord Sagi…?
173
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,450
Yeah…
174
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,750
I see… So Lord Sagi is safe!
175
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,000
You okay, mister?!
176
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,250
I’m sorry…
177
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,500
That Moso acted rashly,
178
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,040
forcing me to make
a false confession.
179
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,080
Man, you’ve been beaten up good…
180
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,490
Well, we’ll tell you about
the developments inside.
181
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,790
Sagi is waiting!
182
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,580
Assimilation: Rock Shower!
183
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,410
We’re Wandering Shinobi…
184
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,290
We make do without having a village
by going around to every village,
185
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,490
stealing Jutsu and
devising new Ninjutsu.
186
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,290
For example,
a Jutsu like this one, too…
187
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,200
S-Say what?
188
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,080
Sharingan!
189
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,830
Assimilation: Sand Coffin!
190
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,500
He’s using the same Jutsu
as Gaara!
191
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,490
Assimilation: Sand Funeral!
192
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,580
Sagi!
193
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,660
How’s Chishima doing…?
194
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,830
He’s okay…
There’s no threat to his life.
195
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,490
He’s resting and receiving treatment
196
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,910
in the treatment room
of my residence.
197
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,200
That’s good…
198
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,370
Did something happen to Chishima?
199
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,370
Who…? Who hurt him?!
200
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,490
Komei… I’m sorry for
the misunderstanding!
201
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,620
My lord, I don't deserve
those magnanimous words!
202
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,620
Although he had suffered injuries,
Chishima came to tell me.
203
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,120
At that time…
204
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,250
I must not let you live as is
205
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,410
now that you have learned
of everything!
206
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,250
As the thief who snuck into
the residence of the feudal lord,
207
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,490
your fate is the death sentence!
208
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,250
No way…!
209
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,490
L-Lord Sagi…
210
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,490
Chishima?!
211
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,410
Bro!
212
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,490
Shuriken wounds…?
213
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,910
Go to the residence doctor!
214
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,000
Lord Sagi…
215
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,490
Please listen…
216
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,200
Lord Moso, no,
Moso has betrayed you…
217
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,490
What?
218
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,660
Moso was the one
219
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,580
who killed your father, Lord Owashi,
and Lady Toki!
220
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,950
And Moso had his own Ninja henchmen
use the guardsmen shuriken
221
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,490
to falsely accuse Lord Komei…
222
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,910
I’m sure Lord Komei learned
of Moso’s scheme and…
223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,620
Hang in there, Chishima!
224
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,450
Lord Sagi, please…
Stop Lord Komei’s execution.
225
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,620
We have to go save him quickly!
226
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,450
I must not stop the execution!
227
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,200
Wh-Why is that?!
228
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,330
I won’t be able to have my revenge
229
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,700
if Moso realizes that
I have learned the truth…
230
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,120
Are you saying it doesn’t matter
who is sacrificed
231
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,870
if it’s for the sake of your revenge?!
232
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,490
Then what would you do?
233
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,450
Komei is being kept under strict watch
by powerful soldiers.
234
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,490
We would have no chance
of winning
235
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,080
if theywe were to cause
a rebellion there…
236
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,080
Then I’ll go!
I will save Komei on my own!
237
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,080
You don’t have a problem
with that, do you?
238
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,910
Lord Sagi…
239
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,250
Do as you like…
240
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,620
And so I disguised myself
as the Cursed Warrior.
241
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,490
I played the part of Cursed Warrior
242
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,490
and attempted to look for
the assassination culprit…
243
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,870
But against my intentions…
244
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,580
Instead of finding
the true culprit…
245
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:04,490
Komei… I was used as a tool
to incriminate you.
246
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,250
I thought the Cursed Warrior
I encountered in my bedroom
247
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,620
was you, Lord Sagi…
248
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,000
And so I headed for
the abandoned temple
249
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,120
where the Cursed Warrior
once vanished.
250
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,950
There I encountered
the Cursed Warrior, but…
251
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,330
That Cursed Warrior wasn’t me.
252
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,500
Perhaps it was a fake
that Moso devised.
253
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,790
That’s it, believe it!
All of it was that old man Moso’s trap!
254
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,370
That Moso!
255
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,580
Did he think to first dispose
of me
256
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,370
and then eventually attempt to rule
the Land of Birds
257
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,490
by doing away with Lord Sagi?
258
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,910
That guy acting like a good guy!
259
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,620
I’ll grab him up and kick his butt!
260
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,910
Naruto, was it?
You did good work.
261
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,490
However…
262
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,790
I will take care of things
from here on!
263
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,500
Well… But…
264
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,040
I will even the score by myself.
265
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,620
As long as the score isn’t settled…
266
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,950
the clock inside my heart…
will remain stopped in the past!
267
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:41,870
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
268
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:53,490
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
269
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:04,790
What dreams did you chase to get here?
270
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:17,000
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
271
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:28,490
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
272
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:39,950
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
273
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,660
I’ll be close to you
274
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,490
What do you mean you will
even the score on your own?!
275
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,450
What good can you do
going by yourself?!
276
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,290
Even you did avenge them,
the dead won’t come back!
277
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,750
Do you still insist on having  revenge?!
278
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,250
Would that make you
feel better?!
279
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,490
Would that really make
your father and sister happy?!
280
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,410
Next time: “When Time Stands Still”
//%
1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,680
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,100
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,760
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,260
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,890
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,350
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,180
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,930
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,470
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,590
With this, you’ve woken up, right?
21
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,100
We had a hindrance back then…
22
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,260
but it won’t be like
that this time.
23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,100
I’ll show you…
the true power of Sharingan.
24
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,590
Fine…Then I’ll go all out too!
25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,600
You take a good look
with your Sharingan…
26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,970
at my Way of Ninja!
27
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,550
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,470
You can’t beat me by just pointlessly…
increasing the number!
29
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,970
You little--!
30
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,590
I can spot the real body in
one shot with my Sharingan.
31
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,590
I deliberately went along
with your game…
32
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,590
I won’t go easy on you now!
33
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,220
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
34
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,470
Father-Son:
The Broken Crest
35
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,140
What was up…
with those eyes of Big Brother’s?
36
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,640
That wasn’t…
just an ordinary Sharingan.
37
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,590
And…quite a bit of time’s
passed since then…
38
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,470
but things are still kind of awkward
between him and Father.
39
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,220
Good morning, Father…
40
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,550
Yeah, good morning.
41
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,680
Sasuke… how have things
been going at the Academy lately?
42
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,590
It’s boring with just school classes.
43
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,930
I’m always number one, so…
44
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,930
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
45
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,390
W-Wow…
46
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,390
This is the fundamental
Jutsu of the Uchiha.
47
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,050
The Sign is as I taught you earlier.
48
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,100
You build up Chakra,
49
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,590
stop it once at around between
the mouth and the chest area,
50
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,800
and spew it out at once after that.
51
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,180
Try it.
52
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,930
Okay!
53
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,800
Father…is teaching me Jutsu himself.
54
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,390
Finally… Father has also recognized me!
55
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,260
I must live up to his expectations!
56
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,010
I too can…!
57
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,390
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
58
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,590
Sure enough, it won’t go like
it did with Itachi, huh?
59
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,590
It might’ve still been
too soon for you.
60
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,220
A member of the Uchiha Clan
is not recognized as full-fledged
61
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,510
until they can use the Fire Style.
62
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,640
The Uchiha crest…
63
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,350
means those who possess
the Uchiha that controls fire.
64
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,470
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
65
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,550
Damn it! One more time!
66
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,930
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
67
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,930
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
68
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,180
Today for sure!
69
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,890
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
70
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,720
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
71
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,590
Sasuke…!
72
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,010
Wait a minute.
73
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,590
What is it?
74
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,760
What…?
75
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,470
Oh… Don’t move.
76
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,590
Okay, finished!
77
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,050
Mother…
78
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,470
Hmm?
79
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,970
No… It’s nothing.
80
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,050
Okay…
81
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,180
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
82
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,140
Sure enough, it won’t go
like it did with Itachi, huh?
83
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,800
It might’ve still been
too soon for you…
84
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,590
I’m just, getting started.
Damn it! One more time!
85
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,600
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
86
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,300
Father!
87
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,930
Hmm?
88
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,970
One more time…
89
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,850
One more time…
Please join me.
90
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,470
It’s still too soon for you.
91
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,680
Even if I were to teach you
for only after a week…
92
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,390
It’s not that…
93
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,800
I’ve gotten…the hang of the Jutsu.
94
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,140
So I want you to see it.
95
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,390
Failure is not an option!
96
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,180
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
97
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,760
That’s my boy.
98
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,100
You’ve done well.
99
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,470
From now on, improve yourself
and soar large
100
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,430
so as not to bring shame
to the crest on your back.
101
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,930
Right!
102
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,050
And…let me say one thing.
103
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,180
Don’t chase after
your older brother anymore.
104
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,640
Mother…?
105
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,300
Hmm?
106
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,720
What does Father really think of
Big Brother and me?
107
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,590
What is it all of a sudden?
108
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:36,590
The other day, Father said to me,
“That’s my boy.”
109
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,720
He’d always said that only
to Big Brother.
110
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,220
So I was really happy.
111
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,850
I see…Good for you.
112
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,430
But lately, Father and Brother
haven’t been getting along, so…
113
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,180
I was thinking…
114
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,260
that I might just be
a replacement for Big Brother.
115
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,590
Your older brother’s your older brother.
And you are you.
116
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,470
Your father cares deeply
about you both.
117
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,680
Then why does he only think
about Big Brother?!
118
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,220
That’s not it…
119
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,890
Your father has to protect
the Uchiha Clan
120
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,590
as a representative of the clan.
121
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,010
What about it?!
122
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,590
Itachi is just bigger than you
and is your elder.
123
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,590
He’ll naturally be entrusted
124
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,140
with that much more work
for the clan, right?
125
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,590
Your father is the supervisor
of the work, so…
126
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,010
it might be that his eyes were
likely to go towards your older brother.
127
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,180
But, this is just between us.
128
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,590
When he’s with me,
129
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,590
your father does nothing
but talk about you.
130
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,510
He’s just always sullen
and awkward, so…
131
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,140
I’ll catch up to Big Brother
no matter what!
132
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,350
Damn it…!
133
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,300
Big Brother’s back is still
far out of reach.
134
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,590
Forgive me, Sasuke…
Maybe another time.
135
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
Clan…Clan…
136
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,180
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own “vessels”
137
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,350
and don’t know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there.
138
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,640
My “vessel” is
dismayed at this foolish clan.
139
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,510
I feel like…ever since that day,
140
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,590
he hasn’t been the same
as he was before.
141
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,350
Big Brother…
142
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,590
Today, when school’s finished,
143
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,680
will you join me for
some Shuriken Jutsu training?
144
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,010
I’m busy.
You should have Father teach you.
145
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:09,590
But even I know that you’re better
at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.
146
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,300
You always treat me like
a nuisance like that.
147
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,590
Forgive me, Sasuke.
Maybe next time…
148
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,010
I don’t have the time to
be dealing with you today.
149
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,470
You always say, “Forgive me, Sasuke,”
and poke me on the forehead.
150
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,850
and you say “today,”
but it never happens.
151
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,600
Thank goodness…
he’s the same as before.
152
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,220
Big Brother…
153
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,510
His eyes looking back
at Father that time…
154
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,590
It wasn’t just an ordinary Sharingan…
155
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,350
And…
156
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,590
Father…?
157
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,590
Hmm?
158
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,590
Are there several types
of Sharingan?
159
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,640
Oh…You’re already interested
in Sharingan?
160
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
However, it's still too soon for you.
161
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,100
It’s totally different from
the Fire Style Jutsu.
162
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,220
But someday, I too…!
163
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,720
After all… I’m your kid, so.
164
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,600
Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu
above the Sharingan,
165
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,100
the Mangekyo Sharingan.
166
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,600
Mangekyo Sharingan…
167
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,220
In the long history of the Uchiha,
168
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,590
it’s a legendary Visual Jutsu
that only a few develop.
169
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,930
And it’s said that it only opened
under a particular condition.
170
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,760
A particular condition…?
171
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,720
Don’t chase after your
older brother anymore.
172
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,180
I wonder what he thinks of my
relationship with Brother?
173
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,600
Father…
174
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,590
Why doesn’t Big Brother care
about me?
175
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,390
He’s a bit peculiar…
176
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,970
He’s a type of person who doesn’t
care for making friends with people.
177
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,140
Why?
178
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,100
Who knows…?
179
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,720
Even I, his father, can’t read that boy.
180
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,590
Here I spoke because I wanted
more of Big Brother’s attention.
181
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,590
Father isn’t against it.
182
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,720
Here, Sasuke!
Your box lunch.
183
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,590
I’ll watch your Shuriken practice
after you come home.
184
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,550
It’s not practice, it’s training!
185
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,640
I’m off!
186
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,140
That’s good…
187
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,800
It’s not that Father dislikes
Big Brother, after all.
188
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,100
Big Brother graduated from the Academy
at the top of his class at age seven.
189
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,600
He learned to use
the Sharingan at age eight.
190
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,930
And he was promoted
to Chunin at age ten.
191
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,680
But, I’ve got the same Uchiha blood
flowing inside me as he does.
192
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,760
I won’t lose to him!
193
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,590
You’re not gonna tell me this is
the best you can do, are you?
194
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,760
You boast about your Way of Ninja
and this is all you've got?
195
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,970
Are you still thinking that
I’m a member of your comrade game?
196
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,180
If that’s the case, you're…
197
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,800
a hopeless fool!
198
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,550
Stop wasting time!
199
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,590
Give me all you’ve got,
200
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,220
you number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja!
201
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,050
When I recalled the parts one by one,
202
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,510
I felt as though
I had understood everything
203
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:45,970
Faded words which I kept so close to me
204
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:55,680
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
205
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,590
and this distant yearning for you
206
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:11,800
I live, simply repeating this cycle
207
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:23,590
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
208
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:33,970
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
209
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,640
I’ll keep these thoughts…
210
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,590
Just as Neji said,
211
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,180
it seems Sasuke’s in
the darkness right now.
212
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,590
Damn it.
213
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,680
He really did hit me with
all his might.
214
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,590
Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade
or anything anymore?!
215
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,890
Don’t all those things we
did together in Squad Seven
216
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,590
mean anything to you?!
217
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,260
Next episode,
“The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan!”
//%
1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,060
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,270
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,440
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,730
Hurry!
13
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,890
Right…
14
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,560
We’re close!
15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,890
There are two enemies left…
16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,350
There are three of us…
lt’s three against two.
17
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,770
We might be able to do it with
one more contact if we do it well.
18
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,350
All right! All right!
Let’s do it!
19
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,890
No! It’s four against two!
20
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,520
Okay, okay! I’m sorry.
21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,890
Counting Akamaru,
it’s four against two!
22
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,150
Let’s finish it quickly with
our new technique next!
23
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,890
Say, say. If necessary,
I’ll do an awesome Shadow Clone,
24
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,480
so it’ll be okay!
25
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,850
That’s reassuring…
26
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,020
But my strategy comes first. Got it?
27
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,520
Y-Yeah…
28
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,900
For that purpose,
29
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,730
we have to catch up
before the sun sets at any cost.
30
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,650
I know. Full throttle!
31
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,480
The sun’s starting to set…
32
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,060
Neither Jirobo nor
Kidomaru have come.
33
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,770
It seems they’re having
a hard time.
34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,890
It doesn’t matter…
More important is Lord Orochimaru.
35
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,480
We’ve only completed one-third
of the journey in half a day…
36
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,270
They all have Curse Marks, huh…
37
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,890
No questions asked, huh?
38
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,520
This is gonna be different
than that time before
39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,730
with your surprise attack…
40
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,650
Too much interference…
41
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,690
Yeah, this is bad…
42
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,850
We don’t know whether
we’ll make it in time at this rate!
43
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,520
Damn! We still can’t catch up…
44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,060
No, this is good enough.
45
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,810
We’ll maintain this distance
and continue the pursuit…
46
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,850
Wh-What do you mean?
47
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,890
I mean, we’re delaying
the attack until dawn breaks.
48
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,690
Get real!
We can’t afford such leisure !
49
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,850
That’s right! Besides, if we’re going
to attack anyway,
50
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,810
isn’t it more advantageous
to use the darkness and attack?!
51
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,230
For us, the darkness works
to our advantage
52
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,890
only the moment
we launch the attack.
53
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,850
It’d be close to impossible
to grab Sasuke,
54
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,770
get away from them and escape
to a safe location
55
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,060
in just that one moment.
56
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,650
If we couldn’t get Sasuke
back in that one moment,
57
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,850
they’d probably just focus
on guarding the coffin.
58
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,730
If that happens, we wouldn’t stand
a chance in the darkness.
59
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,730
On the contrary,
60
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,730
for the part where they wouldn’t
have to move needlessly,
61
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,350
suddenly they’d get the advantage.
62
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,900
It’d be a different story
if we had Neji’s Byakugan, but…
63
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
Hey, come on.
64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,890
Aren’t you forgetting Akamaru’s nose
and mine as well??
65
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,980
I was sure to include your senses
of smell in the calculations!
66
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Even so, up ahead they have
the geographical advantage.
67
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,940
Plus…
68
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,020
if I can’t use my Jutsu,
it’ll be no use.
69
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,150
Even if I seal off their movements
with Shadow Possession Jutsu…
70
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,650
the effect would be reduced to half
if clouds were to cover the moon.
71
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,060
It’s a drag, but there are too many
dangers, and uncertain elements.
72
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,060
But!
73
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,100
Got it!
74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,270
Naruto?
75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,890
You’re the leader…
76
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,980
I’ll follow your instructions, Shikamaru!
77
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,850
Right. I’m counting on you!
78
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,440
The Vessel Arrives Too Late
79
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,310
Hey, Tayuya!
Will we really make it in time?
80
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,310
I was just told to deliver
Master Sasuke by tomorrow.
81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,890
By tomorrow, huh?
82
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,890
I can’t say that we have
lots of time to spare,
83
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,520
but I guess we’ll make it in time.
84
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,890
I hope so.
85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,650
Lord Orochimaru…
86
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,150
Sasuke…
87
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,560
No Sasuke…yet?
88
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,890
He’s running out of time…
He can’t go on any longer.
89
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,850
Lord Orochimaru…
90
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,690
Several bodies have been
prepared for you!
91
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,890
And…you could even use me,
if necessary…
92
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,520
It has to be Sasuke…
93
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,560
How long do you think I’ve waited?
94
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,310
It’s a matter of urgency!
95
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,020
The Third Hokage’s Jutsu…
96
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,890
His curse was stronger
than expected!
97
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,900
Take this! Sealing Jutsu!
Reaper Death Seal!
98
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,900
Wh-What’s this sensation?
99
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,850
Seal!
100
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,890
My arm…
101
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,060
If you don’t “reanimate” right now,
you’ll lose everything!
102
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,060
Is that what you want?!
103
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,060
Lose everything…
104
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,480
I’ve selected and prepared
proficient bodies for you.
105
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,440
Please leave it to me! Also…
106
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,480
I’ll handle the recovery
of Sasuke as well.
107
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,890
Shall I use Kimimaro?
108
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,900
Curse you …
109
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,310
Third Hokage!
110
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,400
Release!
111
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,230
Listen well, everyone!
112
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,650
I shall release you from this prison…
113
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,150
However, it’ll only
be one of you!
114
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,810
Now all that’s left is to
wake up Kimimaro, huh?
115
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,890
Just as I thought…
116
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,900
I wasn’t summoned this time, either.
117
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,520
Dr. Kabuto, I…
118
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Take care of your body.
119
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,190
Your role is now finished.
120
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,890
It’s not Sound Ninja Five now,
Kimimaro…
121
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,310
I…still haven’t…
122
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,440
Your replacement has
already been found.
123
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,520
He possesses power equal
to your “Earth” Curse Mark.
124
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,100
He has been given
the “Heaven” Curse Mark.
125
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,270
Additionally, he even
has the Kekkei Genkai.
126
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,890
Wonder who’s stronger…
127
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,890
What’s the matter?
Don’t get too excited.
128
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,890
Dr. Kabuto…
129
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,890
M-My life, how much do I have left?
130
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,270
You shouldn’t talk anymore…
131
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,400
P-People… People are born
with some kind of meaning…
132
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,690
Since people are born,
133
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,560
there must be some kind
of important calling.
134
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,770
Recently I’ve started thinking so…
135
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,560
That the meaning for being born…
136
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,770
For people, finding the meaning is…
137
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,400
the only freedom God has given.
138
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,940
I understand what you want to say.
139
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,890
Indeed, Lord Orochimaru
is now suffering.
140
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,730
It’s an unprecedented
difficult situation,
141
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,190
but I’ll mince no words.
142
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,600
What can you do now?
143
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,940
You’ve now lost your value
as a “vessel.”
144
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,520
A new vessel is heading this way.
145
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,560
Well…
146
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,100
At this point in time,
it’s too late, but…
147
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,020
Okay! You said you were going
to let one person out of here.
148
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,890
You’re going to keep
your promise.
149
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,480
What’re you doing?
Open the door now!
150
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,940
What? There was another one?
151
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,600
Hurry up and…
152
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,400
No…I…
I’ll be eaten here, right now…
153
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,900
I’ll let you out of here…
154
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,270
And I shall grant you
just one wish.
155
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,560
My clan that was captured
for your experiments.
156
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,890
Please release them.
157
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,600
Sure. Consider it done.
158
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,100
You don’t have to worry.
159
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,350
Your strong will is going to remain
as Residual Aura inside me.
160
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,310
It’s not like you’ll lose everything.
161
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,770
Now then, your flesh is mine…
162
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,480
With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body
will, once again
163
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,940
be unable to reanimate
for several years.
164
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,810
However, there is the next time.
165
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,650
I-Indeed…
166
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,600
my body no longer has value
as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
167
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,890
It will now be difficult for me
who has lost everything…
168
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,890
to find my own calling.
169
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,770
I’ve finally understood that…
170
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,810
Even if it’s not me,
171
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,190
I’ll bring in the new “vessel”
even if it costs me my life.
172
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,690
That’s my repayment to
Lord Orochimaru…
173
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,020
That’s the only redemption
for me for being worthless…
174
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,350
Hold on a minute!
175
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,190
Are we almost there?
176
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,560
No… It should still take a while.
177
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,190
More importantly…
178
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,400
What were those idiots
Jirobo and Kidomaru doing?!
179
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,850
We caught up!
180
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,600
All right! I’ll take care of
this nice and quick!
181
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,690
R-Right away?!
182
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,560
Eat this!
183
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,980
Multiple Fists Barrage!
184
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,600
Chakra in his palm…?!
185
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,890
Shadow Clone Transformation, eh?
186
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,270
Rasengan!
187
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,600
N-No way… His hands now…?!
188
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,350
There’s no point if
I catch you before you do it!
189
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,730
Now, Kiba!
190
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,520
Tunneling Fang!
191
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,890
This was also a Shadow Clone?!
192
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,020
Luring Sakon into alignment with me…
193
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,690
and aiming at me from the start?!
194
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,480
You think you succeeded
just with that?!
195
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,480
Damn!
196
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
I’ve been nailed.
197
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,650
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
198
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,890
A diversion…
199
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,900
He’s coming!
200
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,890
Tayuya! What’re you doing
idling away?!
201
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,190
N-No!
202
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,600
Why do you move forward?!
203
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,060
I can’t dodge!
204
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,890
Here you go!
205
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,690
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
206
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,100
Shikamaru! Let’s get out of here!
207
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,230
Yeah!
208
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,980
Punks…!
209
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,730
You scums… Messing around with us.
210
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,650
They were full of openings
just as I thought.
211
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,890
Having too much ability individually
is also a problem…
212
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,560
It went well.
213
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,850
Yeah, it went just as calculated!
214
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,890
Just in terms of teamwork,
ours was way better than theirs.
215
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,230
I won’t let you get away!
216
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,310
For the first time, I spoke to you
217
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,440
And you smiled
218
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,890
For the first time, I was able to speak
219
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,850
In my own words
220
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,400
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
221
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,890
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
222
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,650
My clumsy attempts with words
223
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:57,310
You listened without turning away
224
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,600
No wonder I get carried away by you
225
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:10,690
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
226
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,890
I feel so sad
227
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,890
But…
228
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,230
For the first time, I spoke to you
229
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,270
And you smiled
230
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,940
For the first time, I was able to speak
231
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,020
In my own words
232
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,650
For the first time, I spoke to you
233
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,890
And you smiled
234
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,310
For the first time, I was able to speak
235
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,270
In my own words
236
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,890
For the first time, I spoke to you
237
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,730
Damn it! To come this far
and have another one appear!
238
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,560
On top of that, there’s something out
of ordinary about this guy.
239
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,600
What’s this bloodcurdling feeling
on my back?
240
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,890
Indeed, we are even on numbers,
two against two.
241
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,230
But this…
242
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,890
I’m sorry, Naruto.
He’s my miscalculation.
243
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,850
Next episode: “Miscalculation:
A New Enemy Appears!”
//%
1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,890
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,850
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,400
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,900
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,650
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:46,520
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:55,890
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:06,770
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:16,100
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,270
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,650
Hey, Akamaru!
12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,810
Wait up, Akamaru.
13
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,690
Akamaru!
14
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,150
Naruto… Umm…
15
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,890
I made you a box lunch.
Eat it if you like.
16
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,350
Oh, thanks.
17
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,150
Wh-What’s this?
18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,440
What the heck’s the idea, you guys…?
This isn’t a picnic.
19
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
I’m sorry.
20
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,400
Come on, it’s okay, right?
21
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,730
A cinch mission just
the three of us can manage.
22
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,890
You yourself said
you weren’t fired up, right?
23
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,890
I’m not fired up!
24
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,890
It’s a mission to catch a petty thief.
25
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,480
It’d be the same no matter
who went on the mission.
26
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,980
Look. Under normal circumstances,
27
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,940
a three-man team of Kiba, Hinata
and Shino would be fundamental.
28
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,890
But unfortunately, Shino is absent
as he’s off on a different mission.
29
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,400
It’d be better if even you were there
than not, right?
30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,890
What, Old Lady?!
That’s taking it too far!
31
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,850
I’ll do my best.
32
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,730
This is a mission I kind of
can’t get into, though.
33
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,890
There’s probably no need to take
the trouble to determine a troop leader.
34
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,480
Anyway, your mission is
to capture the man who stole…
35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,900
the Misogi tea jar owned by
the feudal lord of the Land of Tea.
36
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,890
This man, Gosunkugi.
37
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,190
According to sources,
he’s now hiding in the Land of Stone.
38
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,020
Get over there lickety-split
and catch him lickety-split.
39
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,400
Hearing that makes me feel
less fired up than ever.
40
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,310
Here, Akamaru.
41
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,980
Well, missions like this are okay
once in a while, right?
42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,890
Let’s take it easy.
43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,400
It's a cinch mission, so all the more reason
I want to finish it up quick.
44
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,810
What’ll happen if the Pervy Sage
comes back while I’m gone?
45
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,520
I’m sorry, Naruto.
46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,690
I…um, I was so happy to be
on a mission…with you.
47
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,890
Huh? What did you say, Hinata?
I can’t hear you.
48
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,940
What’re you blushing for?
You’re a weird one.
49
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,890
Well, hold your horses… Look.
50
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,190
We’ll be in the Land of Stone
once we cross that mountain pass.
51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,890
Be sure to fortify yourself
with food by then.
52
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,230
It’s kind of complicated
when it’s like eating myself.
53
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,350
Hey, this is good!
54
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Hinata, you’d make a great wife!
55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,020
What?
56
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,350
Wife…?
57
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,230
Land of Stone
58
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,890
This is the first post station
of the Land of Stone.
59
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,150
Doesn’t it look…kind of rough?
60
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,310
The Bounty Hunter
from the Wilderness
61
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,350
What’re these guys doing…
staring like that?
62
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
This doesn’t feel like
we’ll be able to do this lickety-split.
63
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,560
What is it, Akamaru?
64
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,980
Could it be that Gosunkugi guy
is among them?
65
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,350
Got you, Gosunkugi!
66
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,520
It’s a photo.
67
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,690
What, this is Gosunkugi, isn’t it?
68
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,060
Three million ryo?
69
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,900
What’s the meaning of this?
70
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,890
Look…They’re hanging over there,
and here, too.
71
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,100
All right, I’ll try asking someone.
72
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,190
Asia Saloon
73
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,150
Hello!
74
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,890
Can I help you?
75
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,480
I have something I’d like to ask you.
76
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,060
What, if you’re not a customer, beat it.
77
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,350
Then I’ll order something…
I’ll have ramen.
78
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,100
I’ll have a hamburger steak with cheese.
He’ll have milk.
79
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,520
This is funny. Milk?
Hamburger steak with cheese?
80
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,810
And ramen on top of that?
81
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,440
Are you making a fool of me?
Get out, brats!
82
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,730
If it’s the money, we have some.
83
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,190
That’s not the issue.
84
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,650
Oh… It’s dangerous for kids
to carry such a large amount of money…
85
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,810
I’ll take charge of it for you.
86
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,890
After all, there are lots of bad men
in this town.
87
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,060
Hey, what’re you doing?
Are you still in?
88
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,940
Oh, just a minute.
I got the money. I’ll be right over.
89
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,560
Huh? What’s with you?
Hey, let go!
90
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,190
You’re the one who’ll let go.
91
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,690
How about that?
92
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,770
You brat… You want to fight?!
93
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,810
That’s the plan… Bring it!
94
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,730
You punk!
95
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,940
Hold it, Naruto.
96
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,890
Naruto, look around.
97
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,190
This is bad.
98
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,060
Master, milk.
99
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,890
Who the hell are you?
100
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,310
O-Okay, coming right up!
101
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,850
Here you are.
102
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,890
Thanks.
103
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,980
Now, no need to hesitate.
Drink up.
104
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,650
It’s a treat from
old billiard-ball head over there.
105
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,850
"Billiard-ball head" means me?
Knock it off, you jerk!
106
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,020
Who would treat some puppy milk?
107
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,100
You want to get killed?!
108
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,730
Bounty, Michizo Manaka.
109
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,560
You can take the credit, Master.
110
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,310
Take the money for the milk
from his bounty…
111
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,890
And the money to repair the table, too.
I don’t need change.
112
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,060
He’s strong.
113
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,890
Are you in the same trade as I am?
Sorry about that.
114
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,770
Wait!
115
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
Something you want?
116
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,850
Who the heck are you, old man?
117
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,890
"Old man," you say?
118
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I’m Sazanami, a bounty hunter.
119
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,650
How cool!
120
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,400
Old man!
121
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,190
Say, say…
That thing earlier was cool.
122
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,520
Hm? The iai-nuki?
123
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,850
It was so fast I couldn’t see when
you drew your sword.
124
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,850
It was really surprising…
125
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,980
I bet that’s what they mean
when they say “In a blink of an eye.”
126
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,310
Life and death is on the line
for us bounty hunters…
127
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,900
No matter how many lives we can have,
it wouldn't be enough
128
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,850
if we couldn’t draw our sword
faster than others.
129
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,900
Say, say! Say, say!
What’s a bounty hunter?
130
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,310
Let’s see…
131
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,890
There are people who offer a bounty
in order to capture bad guys.
132
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,400
And a bounty hunter catches
those bad guys and receives the bounty.
133
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,980
Hmm.
134
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,980
Then this guy has
a bounty on him, right?
135
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,890
Boy, that’s…
136
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,940
Why’s there so much money on his head?
137
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
This guy’s just a simple thief…
138
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,310
A simple thief, you say?
139
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,890
Boy, this guy’s a super A-rank bounty
140
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,600
who has killed dozens of people
for the sake of stealing.
141
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,310
What?!
142
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,850
No way.
143
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,150
Say what?
144
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,020
What’s the meaning of this?
I haven’t heard about that.
145
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,810
The feudal lord who commissioned
this mission
146
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,810
might not have known about that.
147
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,730
Mission?
148
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,600
Yeah. We’re Hidden Leaf Ninja
149
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,270
and we came to this town
to capture Gosunkugi.
150
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,100
Leaf?
151
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,730
So you’re Ninja, huh?
152
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,890
This is interesting.
153
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,600
So even kids like this
are qualified to be Ninja?
154
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,400
What?! Don’t make fun of us!
155
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,270
Well, don’t get so mad.
Sorry about that…
156
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,890
I’ll treat you guys to something. Milk?
157
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,350
We’re not Akamaru.
I want ramen!
158
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,810
Then I’ll have a hamburger steak
with cheese.
159
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,730
I-I-I guess I’ll have ramen, too.
160
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,890
Okay. Come with me.
161
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,060
Jeez, no way would there be
ramen in a bar.
162
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,890
Hey, old man. Would even miso ramen
topped with pork be okay?
163
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,440
Sure, have anything you like.
164
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,890
What is this? We’re rapidly moving away
from town.
165
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,400
I don’t see a ramen shop anywhere.
166
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,810
Now then…
167
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,730
I don’t see any ramen shops.
168
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,890
So what I said earlier about treating
you guys is canceled.
169
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,770
Sorry, but you guys are going to die here.
170
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,890
O-Old man…
171
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,230
You guys are going to die here.
172
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,850
Hey, old man…What’s the idea?
173
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,600
To think you guys would know
that Gosunkugi is in this town.
174
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,480
So what if we do know?
175
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,810
Gosunkugi is my prey…
I can’t hand him over to you.
176
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,890
Knock it off!
You should just go get him yourself.
177
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,270
No, even if you guys are kids,
178
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,350
it’s a different story when it comes
to Leaf Ninjas.
179
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,310
It’s better to have fewer…
wait, no competitors.
180
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,730
Old man.
181
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,770
Here I go.
182
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,810
Hinata!
183
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,060
That’s dirty!
184
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,890
Naruto!
185
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,940
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
All-Four Jutsu!
186
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,480
Interesting.
187
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,890
Bring it.
188
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,890
I won’t lose at speed!
189
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,980
Damn it! Where are you?
190
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,480
Too slow.
191
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,150
Boy…
192
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,310
Now you’re the last one.
193
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,560
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
194
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,310
Oh…
195
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,560
I won’t let you do as you please!
196
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,850
Over here!
197
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,980
You’re mine.
198
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,850
Almost.
199
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,560
Forgive me, boy.
200
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,310
I’ll be the one to defeat him,
no matter what.
201
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,350
Akamaru.
202
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,890
Damn it! He got us good.
203
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,600
Hinata, you okay?
204
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,060
Y-Yeah.
205
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,650
Where’s Sazanami?
206
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,890
Could it be he went after Gosunkugi?
207
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,190
I can’t just sit here like this!
He’ll beat us to the draw.
208
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,890
Damn it! Where is that old man?
209
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,350
Did he leave town?
210
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,440
Going after Gosunkugi?
211
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,310
Akamaru, we’re counting on you!
212
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,100
The most crucial treasure is missing here.
213
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,020
Filthy hyena.
214
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,560
I waited a long time for you
to make your move.
215
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,560
Unfortunately, I have
an important job to do.
216
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,400
Time is valuable.
I’ll get right to taking care of you.
217
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,600
Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail.
218
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,100
Gosunkugi, here I come!
219
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,890
You can’t move anymore.
220
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,190
It’s over.
221
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,270
Finish him.
222
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,850
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
223
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,350
Gosunkugi, you’re under arrest!
224
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,060
Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?
225
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Retreat!
226
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,190
I won’t let you get away!
227
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,890
Wait.
228
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,650
Boy…
229
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,060
You must not go.
230
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:06,890
Old man!
231
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,770
H-Hey, Old Man Sazanami.
232
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,650
Stay away from him.
He’s too much for you guys.
233
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,230
How could such a strong guy be beaten?
234
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,560
Gosunkugi isn’t a mere thief.
235
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,890
He’s a Shinobi, same as us.
236
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,890
Shinobi.
237
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,150
Sazanami!
238
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,890
Is this one of Gosunkugi’s comrades?
239
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,850
You! As I recall,
you were in the bar before…
240
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,310
Damn!
241
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,890
Who was that guy?
242
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,400
Hm, what?
243
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,480
A wanted flyer.
244
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,440
Did he mistake us for Gosunkugi?
245
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,690
No, that’s not it.
246
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,810
"This man who calls himself Tokichi
is a major criminal
247
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,310
who has killed a family of three…"
248
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,890
"He has a bird-shaped birthmark
on his chest."
249
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
A bird-shaped birthmark…?
lt couldn’t be…
250
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,400
What is it, Hinata?
251
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,480
I can't tell because
his face is covered with scars…
252
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,020
But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark.
253
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,100
Oh!
254
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,890
He has a bounty on his head, too?
255
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,650
What the heck is going on
with everything?
256
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:41,890
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
257
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:53,520
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
258
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:04,890
What dreams did you chase to get here?
259
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:16,940
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
260
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:28,480
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
261
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:39,900
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
262
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,850
I’ll be close to you
263
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,890
A long, long time ago just recently,
on an overcast clear day…
264
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,890
It was night since morning.
265
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,100
The righteous rogue Sazanami’s
string of his past unwinds and frays.
266
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,890
Ah, the fatal foe Gosunkugi!
267
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,890
Although the situation is
now clear to me,
268
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,890
there are times when
a Shinobi cannot back out!
269
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,890
Hey, hey, hey, Gosunkugi!
270
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,270
Give it up and submit to arrest!
271
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,310
Next time: “Hunt or Be Hunted?!
Showdown at the OK Temple”
//%
1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,820
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,030
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,270
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,710
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,380
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,110
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,820
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,720
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,130
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,900
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,400
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,770
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,740
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,210
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,780
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,290
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,820
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,900
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,000
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,780
He's late.
21
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,730
Naruto!
22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,830
Stay still.
23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,330
Why's it that only
our squad's teacher is late?
24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,240
The other squads have gone off
somewhere with their new teachers,
25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,810
and Iruka Sensei's also left.
26
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,970
Don't look at me.
27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,810
Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?!
28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,920
Hey!
29
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,950
It'll be his fault because he's late.
30
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,160
Man! You're asking for it!
31
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,160
I like stuff like this!
32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,340
A Jonin wouldn't get caught
in such a weak booby trap.
33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,870
That's right. You're such an idiot...!
34
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,420
I got him, I got him...
35
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,350
I-I'm sorry, sir.
36
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,790
I tried to stop him,
but Naruto did it on his own...
37
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,220
It's all good.
38
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,760
Get real.
ls he really a Jonin?
39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,670
How can I put this?
40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,810
As for my first impression
of you guys...?
41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,710
Well, I hate you.
42
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,450
Pass or Fail: Survival Test
43
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,920
Let's see.
44
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,820
First off, let me have
you guys introduce yourselves.
45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,720
Introduce ourselves...
46
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,160
What should we say?
47
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:44,500
Your likes, dislikes, your future dream,
hobbies, things like that!
48
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,710
Hey!  Before that, please tell us
about yourself.
49
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,610
Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.
50
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,480
I don't feel like telling you
guys about my likes and dislikes.
51
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,190
I've never really thought
about my future dream...
52
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,830
As for my hobbies, I have many.
53
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,400
In the end,
isn't all we know his name?
54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,230
Yeah.
55
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,500
Next is you guys.
56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,200
Let's start with you.
57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,840
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
58
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,810
I like instant ramen,
59
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,010
but what I like even more
is the ramen from Ichiraku
60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,780
that Iruka Sensei treats me to.
61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,150
What I dislike is the three minutes
62
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,150
after pouring hot water
in the instant ramen.
63
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
My hobby is eating and
comparing ramen!
64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,490
And my future dream...
65
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,190
is to surpass the Hokage!
66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,730
And so I'm going to get
the entire village
67
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,830
to acknowledge my existence!
68
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,630
I see...
69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
this kid's grown up in
an interesting way.
70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Okay, next.
71
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,540
I'm Sakura Haruno.
72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,040
What I like... I mean, who I like is...
73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,150
And, my hobby is, 					I mean...
74
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,350
My future dream is...
75
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,790
And?
What about your dislikes?
76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,290
Naruto!
77
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,330
Girls at her age are probably
more interested in love
78
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,830
than the Ninja Arts.
79
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,930
And lastly.
80
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,270
My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.
81
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,240
I have lots of dislikes,
but no likes in particular.
82
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,140
Oh...
83
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,810
And...
84
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,820
I don't feel like summing up
my ambition as just a dream
85
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,020
but I do have an ambition!
86
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,820
The ambition to restore my clan
and without fail...
87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,290
to kill a certain man!
88
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,670
He doesn't...
89
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,540
mean me, does he?
90
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,170
Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.
91
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,170
I knew it...
92
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,280
Good!
93
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,810
The three of you are very distinctive
and interesting!
94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,080
We'll have a mission tomorrow!
95
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,820
Yes, sir! What kind of mission?
96
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,820
First, we'll do what we can do
with just four people.
97
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,320
What-what-what?!
98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,730
A survival exercise.
99
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,900
Survival exercise?
100
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,830
Why are we doing an exercise
101
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,670
even though this is supposed
to be a mission?
102
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,100
We've had more than our share
of exercises in the Academy!
103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,270
This is no simple exercise.
104
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,410
Then... then what kind of exercise is it?
105
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,750
Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?
106
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,860
Uh, well, if I tell you,
I know you'll grow disenchanted.
107
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,160
What?
108
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,660
Of the twenty-seven graduates,
109
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,200
only nine will be recognized
as junior ninjas.
110
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,710
The remaining eighteen will
be sent back to the Academy.
111
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,810
In other words, this exercise
is an extremely difficult test
112
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,480
with a failure rate of 66% or higher!
113
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,820
See, see?
114
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,150
You got disenchanted!
115
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,150
That's crazy!
116
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,820
To have suffered that much!
117
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,420
T-Then, what was
the graduation test for?
118
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,830
Oh, that.
119
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,360
It was just to select those who have
the potential of becoming Genin.
120
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,760
Whaaaat?!
121
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,570
Well, that's the way it is.
122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,440
I'll be determining whether
you pass or fail.
123
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,770
Bring your complete set
of Ninja tools!
124
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,440
We meet at five in the morning.
125
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,950
N-No way am I going to be
dropped now!
126
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,850
I've got to have my strength
recognized for real.
127
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,320
I'll be separated from Sasuke
if I fail this test.
128
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,360
This is an exercise of love!
129
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,030
Okay! You're dismissed.
130
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,800
Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.
131
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,870
You'll throw up.
132
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,780
Morning.
133
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,610
Hi, folks. Good morning!
134
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,320
You're late!
135
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Well, a black cat crossed
my path, you see.
136
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,630
Ahem! Oh well...
137
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,330
Okay, it's set for 12:00!
138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,810
Today's assignment is to take
these bells away from me by noon.
139
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,650
Those who can't do it won't get lunch.
140
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,380
They'll be tied to that...
141
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,820
and I'll eat my lunch
before your very eyes.
142
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,820
So that was the point...
143
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,120
for us not to eat breakfast...
144
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,820
But, hold on.
145
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,830
Why are there only two bells?
146
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,960
There are only two,
so at the very least,
147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,560
one will have to
go to the logs.
148
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,730
That person will be disqualified
for failing the mission...
149
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,670
and will return to the Academy.
150
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,470
It might be one person
at the very least,
151
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,070
or it could be all three of you.
152
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,810
You can use your Shuriken.
153
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,150
You won't be able to take the bells
unless you come with the intent to kill me.
154
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,820
But, that's dangerous, sir!
155
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,650
Y-Yeah, that's right!
156
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,820
You couldn't even evade
a chalkboard eraser!
157
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,990
In this world,
158
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,820
those who aren't skilled enough
tend to complain more.
159
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
Well, just ignore the loser...
160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,830
Begin when I give
the "ready-go" signal.
161
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,830
Loser, loser, loser.
162
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,620
Don't be so hasty.
I didn't say start, yet.
163
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,030
No way...!
164
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,830
I didn't see him at all.
165
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,130
So this is a Jonin.
166
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,830
But, that's fine.
167
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,200
At least you came with
the intent to kill me.
168
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,740
How can I put this...?
169
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,910
I feel like I'm finally starting...
170
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,240
to like you guys.
171
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,780
We're going to start.
172
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,120
Ready... start!
173
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,820
What do you want to know?
174
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,090
I didn't think you just
came here to drink tea.
175
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,400
The Jonin in Naruto and company's
Group Seven...
176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,730
What kind of teacher is he?
ls he strict?
177
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,170
You mean Kakashi?
Does he concern you?
178
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,480
I heard a rumor that concerns me.
179
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,820
What's this?
180
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,490
It's a pass-fail list of
the junior ninjas
181
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,660
Kakashi has been
in charge of up until now.
182
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,890
Let me have a look.
183
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,940
T-This is...!
184
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,280
Fundamentally, ninja must mask
their presence and hide.
185
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,690
Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...
186
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,960
Alright! Let's face off
fair and square!
187
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,960
Oh?
188
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,960
That goof.
189
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,030
Say, aren't you a bit
off kilter?
190
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,870
What's off kilter
is your hairstyle!
191
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,750
I'll teach you the first
Shinobi Battle Jutsu...
192
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,820
Taijutsu.
193
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,860
Taijutsu...?
194
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,830
That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...
195
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,360
That being said...
he's going to use weapons?
196
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,440
Make-Out Paradise
197
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,910
What's the matter?
198
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
Why don't you come at me?
199
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,280
But hey... what's with the book?
200
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,810
Why do you ask...?
201
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
It's because I was curious
about what happens next.
202
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,620
Don't worry.
203
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,790
With you guys as opponents,
204
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,120
it makes no difference
if I'm reading or not.
205
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,830
I'm going to rip you apart!
206
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
Darn! This time a spin kick!
207
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,800
Man!
208
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,610
Wha--?!
209
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,980
Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them
from behind multiple times, fool.
210
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,080
The way his hands are positioned...
211
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,880
Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!
212
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:57,920
No way!
213
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,380
With Naruto as his opponent,
214
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,320
that's too strong a Ninjutsu
no matter how you look at it.
215
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,520
That Sign...
lt's a fire-style skill.
216
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,990
That idiot teacher's doing more
than just running around?
217
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,690
Naruto, get out of there quick!
218
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,860
You'll die!
219
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,860
Too late.
220
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,370
Leaf Village Secret!
Ultimate Taijutsu!
221
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,710
One Thousand Years of Death!
222
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,950
Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.
223
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,450
Those two are idiots.
224
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,090
Alright...
225
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,500
Even so, isn't that against the rules?
226
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,270
What're we supposed to do
about his strength?
227
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,740
Darn it!
228
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,080
It wasn't supposed to be
like this.
229
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,120
It... can't be!
230
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,990
This is more than just a rumor.
231
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,830
Kakashi's test might
be a bit difficult...
232
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,870
Even so, this means absolutely
no one has passed...!
233
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,240
That's right...
234
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,870
Kakashi has never had someone pass.
235
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,070
They have all...
236
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,810
been annihilated...
237
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,880
What's the matter?
238
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,650
You won't get lunch if you can't
take the bell by noon.
239
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,720
I know that, I say.
240
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,960
You're not very energetic,
241
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,830
considering you said that
you'd surpass the Hokage.
242
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,900
Darn it! Darn it!
I can fight even if I'm hungry.
243
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,770
I didn't even have dinner last night.
244
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,440
I shouldn't have gone on a diet.
245
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,280
I just got a bit careless earlier!
246
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,420
Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...
247
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,720
But... I've got to take the bell,
no matter what.
248
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,820
No matter what...
249
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,730
I'm... not...
250
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,360
turning back now!
251
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm going to become a Ninja!
252
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,810
Security is your greatest enemy!
253
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,480
Now for my favorite
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
254
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,290
Seven... Narutos?
255
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,830
What? They're not just images?
256
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,830
Are they all real?
The real thing?
257
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,710
Not the clone,
but the shadow clone, eh.
258
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,810
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!
259
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,110
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
260
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,660
Those aren't just images
but actual clones!
261
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,830
That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
262
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,870
It's the forbidden Jutsu
that did in Mizuki.
263
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,200
Judging from your ability,
264
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,770
that Jutsu should have
a one-minute limit.
265
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,740
Even if you talk trash,
266
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,810
Naruto is Naruto
after all is said and done...
267
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,650
You still can't beat me with that skill.
268
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,820
W-What?! Behind me?!
269
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,490
Ninja shouldn't let
the enemy take them from behind.
270
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,260
Right, Kakashi Sensei?
271
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,330
Using the Shadow Clone,
272
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,830
I had one of them come up
273
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,840
from the bottom of the river
and sneak behind you!
274
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,270
Here's one for that attack
on my butt earlier!
275
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,380
Naruto, not bad!
276
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,810
So... a diversionary tactic, eh?
277
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,820
Now... allow me to punch you!
278
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
What?!
279
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,630
The one who got punched was...
280
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,900
Naruto?
281
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,810
Ouch!
282
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,940
You...!
283
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,980
You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!
284
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,450
You used the Transformation Jutsu
to change yourself, didn't you?!
285
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,280
It's you!
286
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,820
You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.
287
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,450
You smell like Kakashi Sensei!
288
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,620
The smell of an old guy!
289
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,290
Why you--!
290
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,860
Hey! For the time being,
let's try undoing the Jutsu.
291
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,830
If we do that,
only the two will remain... so...
292
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,830
You should've realized that sooner,
you idiot!
293
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,070
You're me, you idiot!
Just undo the Jutsu!
294
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,810
Naruto...
295
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,450
You're embarrassing to watch...
296
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,780
That was the Substitution Jutsu,
you fool.
297
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,350
Essentially, it's a skill used
to quickly switch one's own body
298
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,450
with an object or animal.
299
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,860
This makes your enemy think
you're being attacked,
300
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,090
but then you strike during
their unguarded moment.
301
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,200
After letting himself get caught
by the real Naruto,
302
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,940
the Jonin fool switched bodies
with one of the clone Narutos.
303
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Not only did he make Naruto
think he'd been nailed...
304
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,740
he used Naruto's own attack on him.
305
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,280
A bell?!
306
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,690
You really must have been in a hurry.
307
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,350
You've dropped a bell!
308
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,030
What the heck is this?!
309
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,770
Of course it's a trap...
310
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,900
H-H-Hey!
311
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,840
That jonin doesn't lower his guard
even when he's fighting Naruto.
312
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,110
The bell!
313
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,820
You have to think when using Jutsu.
314
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,820
They can be used against you.
315
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,790
Also...
316
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,290
...don't get caught in
an obvious trap, you fool.
317
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,900
A Ninja must see
through deception!
318
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,900
I know that, I say!
319
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,040
You know, I'm telling you
because you don't get it.
320
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,070
Listen up!
321
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,410
Your movements are wasteful.
322
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,980
Now!
323
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
He finally dropped his guard!
324
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,150
You're so...
325
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,490
No way!
326
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,130
You jerk Sasuke!
327
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,830
You're overdoing it!
328
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,370
Darn it!
329
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,130
At this rate, there's no way
I can beat Kakashi Sensei.
330
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,540
But if I don't take the bell...
331
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,340
I won't get lunch...
332
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,670
No... I'll fail the test!
333
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,780
He says a Ninja must see
through deception,
334
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,710
but I have no idea what that means.
335
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,810
How in the world can I take
the bell back
336
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,810
from Kakashi Sensei?!
337
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,820
Next episode:
"You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision"
338
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't miss my outstanding performance!

00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:10,749
<i>C'mon!</i>
2
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,722
<i>Running like a fugitive,</i>
3
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,925
<i>Being chased by something</i>
4
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,263
<i>Inside my heart is pounding</i>
5
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,999
<i>My throat dry like it's withering</i>
6
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,803
<i>For no single one,</i>
7
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:39,578
<i>To none does belong,</i>
8
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:45,317
<i>This time is ours, right now...</i>
9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,823
<i>Unraveling the pain,</i>
10
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,655
<i>Unraveling our hearts,</i>
11
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:54,060
<i>Unraveling shadows</i>
12
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,362
<i>Stifling our breath,</i>
13
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,334
<i>Reaching for beyond,</i>
14
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:01,836
<i>Tearing through the dark</i>
15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:10,304
<i>In fighting and in love</i>
16
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,909
<i>To the distant light above,</i>
17
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,548
<i>Yes, we are on the way</i>
18
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,589
<i>I wanna rock...</i>
19
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:27,687
<i>Rockin' my heart</i>
20
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,182
<i>It seems I've overused</i>
<i>my Sharingan...</i>
21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,790
Are you alright, Sensei?
22
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,389
Not really... It will be hard just to
move for about a week...
23
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:50,826
Well...
24
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:53,594
It would be better if
you didn't move for a while.
25
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,899
O-Okay...
26
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:01,467
Hey! Sensei's awake.
27
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:03,337
Come on!
28
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:05,345
Your Sharingan is fantastic,
29
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,937
but if it puts that much of a strain
on your body, it may not be worth it!
30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,410
S-Sorry...
31
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:12,246
But you know...
32
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:15,114
He did take down
a real powerful Ninja like that!
33
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,918
We probably don't need to
worry for a while.
34
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,552
Anyway, that kid with the mask...
What was he?
35
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,794
He was an ANBU black ops
from the Hidden Mist village.
36
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,965
It's a mask that the elite
Ninja Tracking Unit wears.
37
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:30,197
The elite Ninja Tracking Unit?
38
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:33,232
They're commonly called the
"fire extinguishing corps,"
39
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,774
and their duty is to erase all traces
that a Ninja ever lived.
40
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,103
The body of the Ninja reveals
a variety of things...
41
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:44,914
Ninjutsu secrets and Chakra characteristics
which permeate the Ninja of their village...
42
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:49,888
the composition of secret medicines
used on a Ninja's body...
43
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:53,488
For instance, if I were to die,
44
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,128
every secret about my Sharingan
would be investigated thoroughly,
45
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,561
and in the worst case,
46
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,727
there's a danger that
my entire Jutsu could be stolen.
47
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,170
In other words,
Tracker Ninja are specialists
48
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,265
that prevent village secrets
from leaking out
49
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,576
by killing Rogue Ninja
who've run away from their village,
50
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:16,014
and completely eliminating
their bodies.
51
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,816
First, I'll cut the mouth cloth
and have him spit up blood...
52
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:25,881
It's alright.
53
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,655
I'll do it... myself...
54
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:32,223
What?
You've already come back to life...
55
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:40,365
Darn, you really are rough...
56
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,302
You too, Zabuza.
57
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:47,243
Please don't pull them out
so violently or you really will die.
58
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:55,278
How long do you plan on keeping
that shady-looking mask on?!
59
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,285
Take it off!
60
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:02,552
It's a relic from the past,
and it's been handy for trickery...
61
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:11,168
But if I hadn't rescued you,
you certainly would have been killed.
62
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,639
If you were going to put me
into a state of apparent death,
63
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,540
you didn't need to aim for
the secret opening on my neck.
64
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:20,510
You're really a nasty one.
65
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:22,807
It couldn't be helped...
66
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:27,949
Besides, I didn't want to mark up
your immaculate body.
67
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:32,417
And also, I can aim more accurately
on the point on the neck
68
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,461
where there's not much muscle.
69
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,258
You'll be numb for about a week
and won't be able to move.
70
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:45,600
But since you're Zabuza,
perhaps you'll soon be able to move...
71
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:52,844
You're so innocent, smart,
and untainted...
72
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,909
That's what I like about you.
73
00:04:57,818 --> 00:05:00,150
I am, after all, still a child.
74
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:04,185
The fog has lifted.
75
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,116
Yes.
76
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,387
Will you be alright the next time?
77
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:11,492
The next time...
78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,725
I'll be able to see right
through the Sharingan.
79
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:21,063
<i>The Forest of Chakra</i>
80
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,106
<i>What is this?</i>
81
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:26,607
<i>Even though Zabuza is dead...</i>
82
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,782
<i>this indescribable uneasiness...</i>
83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,115
<i>it must mean something</i>
<i>very important...</i>
84
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:35,220
<i>I have a feeling</i>
<i>I've overlooked something.</i>
85
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,683
What's going on?!
Sensei?
86
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:39,684
What?
87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,354
Oh... so to continue my earlier story...
88
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:44,686
Ninja trackers...
89
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:48,257
take care of the bodies of people they've
killed, immediately and on the spot.
90
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,359
So what about that?
91
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,939
What did that kid with
the mask do with Zabuza?
92
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,344
How should we know?!
93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,208
That masked one
took Zabuza away!
94
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,109
That's right...
95
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:09,479
If he needed proof he'd killed Zabuza,
he could simply have taken the head...
96
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:11,816
And the question is...
97
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:15,988
the weapon the Ninja tracker kid
used to kill Zabuza...
98
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:18,596
A regular Senbon...
99
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:20,699
That's impossible...
100
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,763
Right... it's impossible?!
101
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:28,800
What have you guys
been clamoring on and on about?!
102
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:32,739
It's probably that...
Zabuza is alive!
103
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:35,572
What?
104
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,217
What the heck do you mean?!
105
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:41,777
But Kakashi Sensei,
you made sure that he was dead!
106
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,118
It's true, I did make sure...
107
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:48,926
But, he was probably just in
a state of near-death.
108
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:58,469
The Senbon that Tracker Ninja used has
a very low ability to kill
109
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,803
unless it hits a vital spot...
110
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,302
It's something that was originally used
for medical treatments
111
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:05,845
such as acupuncture therapy.
112
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:10,350
Ninja trackers know all about
the structure of the human body...
113
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:15,110
putting people into a state of apparent
near death is probably simple for them.
114
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,553
First, he went to the trouble of
taking Zabuza's corpse
115
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,651
which was probably heavier
than he is.
116
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:27,265
Second, he used a Senbon,
a weapon with a low ability to kill.
117
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:30,164
From these two factors,
118
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:35,140
that youth wasn't aiming to
kill Zabuza but to save him.
119
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,569
Aren't you reading
way too much into it?
120
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,738
No...
121
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,276
If something seems fishy,
make preparations before it's too late.
122
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,616
That's also an iron clad rule
of the Shinobi!
123
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:57,553
<i>Humph... To hear that Zabuza</i>
<i>may be alive and to be pleased...</i>
124
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:01,193
Sensei, what do we do to make preparations
before it's too late?
125
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,459
You won't even be able
to move for a while...
126
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,165
I'll assign you training!
127
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:14,612
W-Wait a minute! Even with training,
we're not gonna be that strong!
128
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:19,681
Our opponent is a Ninja whom even you,
with the Sharingan, had a tough fight with!
129
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:22,551
Are you trying to kill us?!
130
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,257
Sakura...
131
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,358
Who was it that saved me
during my difficult battle?
132
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:31,892
You've all quickly grown...
especially Naruto!
133
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,798
You've grown the most!
134
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,301
<i>He clearly does seem somewhat</i>
<i>stronger than before, but...</i>
135
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:48,876
So you noticed, Kakashi Sensei!
Now it's getting interesting!
136
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,941
It's not interesting at all...
137
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:58,146
Who the heck are you?
138
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:01,216
Hey, Inari!
Where've you been?!
139
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,990
Welcome back... Grandpa...
140
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,825
Inari, what sort of greeting is that?!
141
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:09,025
These are the Ninja
who escorted your grandpa!
142
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:11,969
It's okay, it's okay.
Right, Inari?
143
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,513
Mom, these guys will die...
144
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:23,749
There's no way they can
oppose Gato and win.
145
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,785
Say what, you little brat!
146
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,018
Now listen up!
147
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm a super hero who's gonna become
an awesome Ninja
148
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,052
named Hokage in the future!
149
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,559
I don't know if it's Gato or
Chocolat or whatever...
150
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:37,188
I'm not worried
about those guys, at all!
151
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:42,368
Huh, a hero. That's ridiculous!
There's no such thing!
152
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,728
W-What did you say?!
153
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,127
Stop that!
154
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,799
If you don't want to die,
you'd better hurry up and go home...
155
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,311
Inari, where're you going?
156
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,185
The sea...
I'll be looking at the sea...
157
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,450
I apologize.
158
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:09,587
Shucks!
159
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:14,123
That brat... I need to tell him
a thing or two!
160
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,330
Huh?
161
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,233
<i>Is he crying?!</i>
162
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,988
D-Dad...
163
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,331
So, now the training begins!
164
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:53,196
Yes, sir!
165
00:10:53,874 --> 00:11:00,609
So... before that, let me again explain
Chakra power for a Ninja, from the basics.
166
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:01,812
At this point...
167
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:06,013
Of course we know about that!
Chatora, right?
168
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:07,743
It's Chakra...
169
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:10,451
Yes, Sakura...?
170
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,124
Are you listening, Naruto?!
171
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,689
It's tiresome, so I'll explain it simply!
172
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:22,131
Chakra is energy that
a Ninja needs when he uses a Jutsu!
173
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:24,599
It's made up of two energies:
174
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:29,234
1) Physical energy gathered together
from each and every cell in the body and
175
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:35,912
2) Spiritual energy accumulated based
on numerous trainings and experiences!
176
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:41,045
In other words, Jutsu wrings out and
combines these two energies
177
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,418
from within the body,
178
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:45,617
and this is called
"combining the Chakra."
179
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:51,092
Then Chakra is activated
by forming hand "signs."
180
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,258
That's exactly right!
181
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:56,867
Iruka Sensei really does
have good students.
182
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,432
Whatever! I may not understand
difficult explanations,
183
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:04,476
but I'll just learn it with my body!
184
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:06,211
Naruto is absolutely right...
185
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:09,409
We're already able to use Jutsu...
186
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:13,679
No! All of you still haven't used
Chakra efficiently.
187
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:14,782
What?!
188
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,187
Hold on and listen...
189
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,488
As Sakura explained earlier,
190
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,597
combining Chakra means picking up
both the physical and spiritual energies
191
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:26,530
and mixing them together
within the body.
192
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:33,398
And of course the amount of each energy,
the preparation of the energy,
193
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,999
changes based on
the Jutsu you want to activate...
194
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:39,840
All of you at present aren't
using Chakra efficiently!
195
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:44,175
Even if you're able to combine
a lot of Chakra,
196
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:47,118
if you're not able to control it
in a balanced way
197
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,486
the effectiveness of the Jutsu
not only will be cut in half
198
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,892
but it may not even
be activated at all.
199
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,157
Wasting energy will prevent you from
battling for long periods.
200
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:59,756
These are some of
the weaknesses that can occur.
201
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,562
W-What should we do...?
202
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,602
You need to learn to control
the Chakra with your body!
203
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:11,403
It's difficult training that requires you
to put your life on the line to master!
204
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:15,013
W-What will we do?
205
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:17,048
Hm?
206
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:18,744
Tree climbing...
207
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,551
Tree climbing?!
208
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:21,718
That's right.
209
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,082
But it's not just simple tree-climbing!
210
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,421
You will climb
without using your hands.
211
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,284
What? How?
212
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,422
Well! Just watch.
213
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:49,675
He's climbing...
214
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,978
Perpendicular to the tree
and with his feet!
215
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,248
So see, kind of like this...
216
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:02,521
Focus the Chakra on the bottoms of your feet
and make them stick to the tree trunk.
217
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,993
If you use Chakra well,
you can do things like this.
218
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,255
Wait a minute!
219
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,226
How does something like that
make you strong?
220
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:12,696
So this is the main point...
221
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:15,366
The aim of this training is
to accumulate
222
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:19,071
the required amount of combined Chakra
to the required spot...
223
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,974
This is surprisingly difficult
even for an expert Ninja.
224
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,877
The amount of Chakra used
for tree climbing is very subtle.
225
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:32,923
And the bottoms of the feet are
the most difficult place to gather Chakra.
226
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:37,058
Anyway! In other words,
if you master that control
227
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:42,534
it will be possible to master
any Jutsu. In theory, that is!
228
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,035
The second aim is to maintain
that combined Chakra.
229
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,003
Ninja combine the most Chakra
during battles.
230
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,177
Under such situations,
231
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,910
"control" and "maintenance"
of Chakra becomes most difficult.
232
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:02,183
So anyway, nothing's really gonna
happen with me saying this and that...
233
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:06,090
You'll need to learn it with your bodies
234
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,430
Use that Kunai to put a mark
at the spot
235
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,229
where you can climb up to
under your own strength now.
236
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,034
Next make an effort to
put a mark further from it.
237
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,374
You aren't good enough to
walk up from the start,
238
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:30,507
so run and use your momentum
to get used to it... You got it?!
239
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:36,780
This training is nothing!
Hah, it's too easy for me!
240
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,989
After all, I'm the man
who's grown the most!
241
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:44,923
Enough with the talk...
Now get to it. Try climbing any tree.
242
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:50,828
<i>OK, so first I need to gather</i>
<i>the Chakra on the bottoms of my feet...</i>
243
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:03,244
Ready!! Here I go!
244
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,857
<i>I didn't think it'd be this difficult to</i>
<i>maintain a constant amount of Chakra...</i>
245
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,161
<i>If the Chakra is too strong</i>
<i>you get pushed back...</i>
246
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:31,877
<i>But if the Chakra is too weak,</i>
<i>there's no sticking power and that happens.</i>
247
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:35,071
Well...!
248
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:37,773
The difference between Naruto and Sasuke
seems about right.
249
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:39,550
This is pretty easy!
250
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:40,953
What?!
251
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,722
S-Sakura!
252
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:54,063
So, it looks like the one with the best control
of the Chakra is Sakura, the girl...
253
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:00,036
Wow! Way to go, Sakura!
254
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,234
Just what you'd expect from
the girl I set my sights on!
255
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,204
<i>But it does sort of tick me off!</i>
256
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:05,567
Whatever!
257
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:08,540
<i>I wanted Sasuke to notice me...</i>
258
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:11,043
<i>Why does this always happen?!</i>
259
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:14,147
Well, not only does Sakura have
knowledge about Chakra,
260
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:17,346
her control and stamina
are pretty good.
261
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,917
It looks like...
262
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:24,597
She might be the closest one to
becoming a Hokage... unlike someone else.
263
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:29,092
And also, the Uchiha Clan
isn't really that great...
264
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,198
Shut up Sensei!
265
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,203
<i>Sasuke won't like me then!</i>
266
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:40,811
<i>Having said that... Naruto and Sasuke...</i>
267
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:44,282
<i>Those two have an incredible amount</i>
<i>of Chakra hidden in them...</i>
268
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,477
<i>that Sakura can't even match!</i>
269
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:50,280
<i>If this training goes well,</i>
<i>this will become an asset to them...</i>
270
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,919
OK! First I'll catch up to Sasuke!
271
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,455
I'll do it... for sure!
272
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:01,600
<i>Whatever!</i>
273
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,500
<i>Even if they do that,</i>
<i>it's just a waste...</i>
274
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:29,289
Unbelievable...
275
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,454
Even you got beaten and
had to come back?
276
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,259
The Ninja from the Hidden Mist Village
look like total weaklings!
277
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:36,636
You can't even clean up after
your subordinates,
278
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,933
and you think you're a "demon"!
Don't make me laugh!
279
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,738
<i>So they're drawing swords...</i>
280
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,143
Hold on. Wait.
281
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:54,844
Hey... There's no need to stay silent!
282
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:58,121
Why don't you say something?
283
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,761
Don't touch Zabuza
with your dirty hands!
284
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:07,256
I-It's gonna break...!
285
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,130
<i>N-No way...</i>
286
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,467
<i>He moved...in an instant...</i>
287
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,069
I wouldn't do that...
I'm ticked off!!
288
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:25,409
Next time...
289
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:27,883
If you lose again next time...
290
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:30,445
remember that there'll be
no place for you here!
291
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:32,921
I'm leaving!
292
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:40,165
Haku... Such unnecessary actions...
293
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:41,956
I know...
294
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:47,098
But it's too early to take down
Gato right now...
295
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:49,504
If we make trouble here...
296
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:55,047
We'll be pursued by them again.
297
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,615
We must restrain ourselves for now.
298
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:00,649
Yeah...
299
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,447
You're right.
300
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,587
Ohhhhh...
301
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,127
Ou-ch!!
302
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,075
<i>I'm totally worn out!</i>
303
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,605
<i>How much stamina</i>
<i>can those two have?</i>
304
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,580
<i>But Naruto isn't getting</i>
<i>any better at all.</i>
305
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:39,757
<i>He'll soon give up and</i>
<i>start throwing a tantrum.</i>
306
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:42,752
Shoot!
307
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,430
<i>See! He sure is</i>
<i>an easy one to figure out!</i>
308
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,401
Hey, Sakura!
309
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:51,666
Can you give me some tips?
310
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:52,502
What?
311
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,441
Let's keep it a secret from Sasuke!
Come on, come on.
312
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:03,173
He's getting stronger and stronger...
How strong will he get?
313
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,109
At any rate Naruto...
314
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:09,917
the amount of your dormant Chakra
is probably more than Sasuke's.
315
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:15,357
And it's even more than mine!
316
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,758
I look forward to it... I really do.
317
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:58,391
That Inari...
He was crying all by himself.
318
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,935
He was looking at the sea
and crying the entire time.
319
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,439
He's always crying all alone.
320
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,532
What's that gonna do?
321
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,872
What happened
that made him so sad?!
322
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,977
Next time:
"The Land Where a Hero Once Lived"
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,320
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,220
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,300
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,100
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,270
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,310
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,550
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,150
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,590
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,070
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,510
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,340
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,520
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,850
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:21,260
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,020
It’s a custom where balance is preserved
by fighting and removing life.
20
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,860
This is the friendship
of the Shinobi world.
21
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,560
This is a fight for life with the pride
of the village and
22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
one’s own dream on the line.
23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,730
Heh, I’m convinced.
24
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,670
Anything is fine.
25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,270
Just tell us the content
of that fight-for-life test.
26
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,110
Very well.
27
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,710
Now then, this is where I’d
like to explain the third exam.
28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,180
But actually…
29
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,660
Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who was
given the task of judge, to speak first.
30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,390
I leave it to you…
31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,500
There’s something... I’d like you all
to do...
32
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,500
before the third exam.
33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,010
And that is a preliminary
to the third exam,
34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,710
with participation in
the main battle on the line.
35
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,050
Preliminary?
36
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,150
What do you mean…preliminary?!
37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,860
Sensei, I don’t understand
the point of that preliminary.
38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,730
Why aren’t we doing the next exam
with the remaining test-takers?
39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,560
This time around,
40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,600
perhaps because the first and
second exams were easy,
41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,600
there are a few too many
people left, you see.
42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,270
In accordance with the rules
of the Chunin Exams,
43
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,010
a preliminary will be held in order to
reduce the number advancing.
44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,550
N-No way!
45
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,350
As Lord Hokage said before,
46
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,720
many guests will be coming
to the third exam.
47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,230
So we can’t have long pointless matches
and our time is limited as well.
48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,630
Therefore, those of you
not in top physical condition…
49
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,800
Hey, is he okay…?!
50
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,510
The teacher doesn’t look well himself?!
51
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,680
Excuse me.
52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,550
Those of you who wish to drop out,
please speak up now.
53
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,720
The preliminary will
begin immediately, so…
54
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,650
Immediately, you say…?!
55
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,920
But we finally made it through
the second exam.
56
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,090
This is a pain…
57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,560
Huh? What about our meal?
58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,600
Narrowing the Field:
Sudden Death Elimination!
59
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,210
Okay!
60
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
I’m going to do my best, no matter what!
61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,980
I promised Kabuto, too…
62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,550
And oh...
63
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,820
I forgot to mention this, but it will
be individual battles from now on.
64
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,560
It is your decision, so feel free
to raise your hands and drop out.
65
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,390
Who’s going to quit?!
66
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,100
Sasuke?!
67
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,340
The waves of pain are
coming faster...
68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,540
Sasuke… I knew it.
69
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,810
Sasuke, you should quit
these preliminaries!
70
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,550
Huh?!
71
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,380
L-Look, you haven't been yourself
72
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,080
ever since you got worked
over by that Orochimaru guy!
73
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,460
That bruise hurts even now, right…?
74
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,560
Bruise…?
75
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,560
At this rate…!
76
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,900
I gave him a parting gift.
77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,140
Sasuke will definitely seek me…
in search of power.
78
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,330
You’re the only one left.
79
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,730
Please…
80
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,900
Please, quit!
81
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,640
I’m…scared.
82
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,180
Sakura…
83
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,880
I knew it.
84
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,120
What shall we do?
85
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,550
We should remove him
from the exams
86
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,750
and isolate him with
Anbu bodyguards on him.
87
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,090
We should recommend that
he retire immediately.
88
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,860
He’s not the kind of type to
just obey like that…?!
89
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,230
After all, he’s of the Uchiha clan.
90
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,400
What’re you talking nonsense for?!
91
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,340
I’ll make him stop, by force if needed!
92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,440
The Curse Mark responds even
when one’s just building up Chakra
93
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,610
and attempts to forcibly
extract his strength!
94
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,550
It’s a prohibited Jutsu that eats
into the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!
95
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,820
It’s a wonder that kid is even enduring it.
96
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,050
He should really already be dead!
97
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,890
Lord Hokage!
98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,260
You’re in no condition to
fight properly, Sasuke…!
99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,560
Shut up.
100
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,500
I understand!
101
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,530
Be quiet!
102
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,470
But you’ve been enduring the pain
this whole time, right?!
103
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,140
Please be quiet!
104
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,680
No matter what you say, Sasuke...
105
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,680
I’m going to tell the teachers
about the bruise!
106
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,910
If I do that...
107
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,420
Well…
108
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,750
Oh…?!
109
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,390
What…?
110
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,000
Excuse me…I’ll quit.
111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,930
K-Kabuto…?
112
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Let's see...
113
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,940
Kabuto Yakushi of
the Leaf Village, correct?
114
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,550
Then, you may step back.
115
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,220
Okay.
116
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,550
Kabuto!
117
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,690
Why’re you quitting?!
118
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,390
Tell me! Why?!
119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,590
This guy…
120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,700
I’m sorry, Naruto…
121
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,600
But my body is worn out.
122
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,540
Actually before the first exam...
123
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,510
when I wrangled with
the guys from Sound Village,
124
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,510
I’ve had no hearing at all in my left ear.
125
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,050
To fight right away…
126
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,480
and to be told that my life would
also be on the line, I can’t go on.
127
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,560
I’ve seen that face a few times.
128
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,100
As I recall, I think he dropped out
of the main battle before, as well.
129
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,170
What in the world is he thinking?
130
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,440
Anko.
131
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,910
Uh…yes.
132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,710
Kabuto Yakushi.
133
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,750
According to the data,
he has failed six straight times.
134
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,250
What about his background?
135
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,550
From his time at the Academy,
136
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,560
he was a student who did
not really stand out,
137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
and his grades were ordinary.
138
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,230
He finally passed the graduation
exam on his third try.
139
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,800
After that, as for the missions
he carried out,
140
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,100
two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.
141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,440
It’s not a battle record to
write home about.
142
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,470
However…
143
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,540
However…?
144
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,510
It’s about before the Academy.
145
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,550
Hmm?
146
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,810
Do you remember the story...
147
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,390
about the one boy brought back
from the Kikyo Pass battle?
148
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,020
I remember.
149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,560
As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivor
at the battlefield
150
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,430
was taken back by a Jonin from
the medical unit.
151
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,130
So he’s that boy…?
152
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Don’t take arbitrary actions.
153
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,810
Have you forgotten
Orochimaru’s orders?
154
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,680
I leave it to you guys.
155
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,710
You in particular, Yoroi.
156
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,320
There should be no problems
here with your ability.
157
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,090
This is where you can
show your strength.
158
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,390
Those of you who are irritated that
I’m ahead of you.
159
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,800
So you’re Orochimaru’s favorite, huh?
160
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,270
Don’t get all high and mighty, kid.
161
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,930
I understand, Yoroi sir.
162
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,310
Oh.
163
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,550
Naruto… Sasuke…
164
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,180
I wanted to play with you guys
a little more.
165
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,550
But if I do more than this…
166
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,520
The old me might get stirred up.
167
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,090
I am a spy so far as it goes.
168
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,260
I cannot expose myself, here.
169
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,570
Also…if you are going to watch.
170
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,100
My role of information collecting
has served its purpose…
171
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,540
Master Orochimaru.
172
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,850
I’ll save the fun, for some other time…
173
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,250
Sasuke…
174
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,550
And Naruto...
175
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,550
You too.
176
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,940
Now then, there are no others
who will quit?
177
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,780
I must tell the teachers,
about Sasuke’s bruise!
178
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,820
Huh?!
179
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,650
Be quiet about this bruise.
180
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,130
Why’re you acting tough like that?!
181
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,570
I don’t want to watch you suffer
all the time anymore!
182
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,600
For me you are…!
183
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
This has nothing to do with you!
184
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,370
It’s none of your business.
185
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,880
I said it once before…
186
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,050
I’m an avenger.
187
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,730
This is not just a mere exam to me.
188
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,730
The Chunin business has
nothing to do with me.
189
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,110
“Am I strong?”
All I want is the answer to that.
190
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,870
By fighting with those who are strong!
191
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,440
And…
192
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,480
I’m Gaara of the desert.
193
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,750
Hey, you there…
ldentify yourself.
194
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,550
I declare.
195
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,550
You are absolutely no match for me.
196
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,690
If I have the opportunity to fight you
in the next exam,
197
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,600
we won’t run or hide.
198
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,530
And they’re... here!
199
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,980
I will not allow even you
to take my path away from me!
200
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,710
Sasuke…
201
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,680
You!
202
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,480
What’re you doing putting up
a front, you idiot?!
203
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,150
Here Sakura is this worried about you--!
204
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,150
Naruto!
205
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,930
I want to fight you, too.
206
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,060
Huh?!
207
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,400
What Orochimaru said
is sitting on my mind.
208
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,940
I will let Sasuke do the test...
209
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,380
– and see how things go.
– Wha--?!
210
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,110
L-Lord Hokage…!
211
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,850
However, if the Curse Mark opens
212
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,550
and the power gets even a little bit
out of control,
213
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,880
get in there and stop it.
214
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,750
All right.
215
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,990
But...!
216
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,660
I understand.
217
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,100
Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.
218
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,270
The preliminaries to come
will be one-on-one individual battles.
219
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,710
In other words,
actual battle format.
220
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,980
There are now exactly twenty people,
so we will conduct ten battles.
221
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,720
The winners will be able to
advance to the third exam.
222
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,220
There are no rules at all.
223
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,230
You will fight until someone dies,
collapses…or admits defeat.
224
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,570
And... please admit defeat right away
if you don’t want to die.
225
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,770
However, in case I judge
that a match is over…
226
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,550
err... I don’t want to needlessly increase
dead bodies,
227
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,850
so I will intervene and stop the match
or something to that effect.
228
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,390
What holds the key to your destinies is…
229
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,720
Open it.
230
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,900
This.
231
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,110
The names of two foes will be
randomly selected and
232
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,640
displayed on this electronic signboard.
233
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,710
Now then, let’s get right down to it
234
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,480
and announce the two names
for the first battle.
235
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,230
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
236
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,900
To think it’d be so soon…?!
237
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,640
I couldn’t ask for more.
238
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,210
No way…!
239
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,880
Why Sasuke?!
240
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,150
Now then, the two displayed on
the signboard, come forward.
241
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,900
For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado and
Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.
242
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,470
No objections, right?
243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,300
– Right. 					– No!
244
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,520
All I can do now is watch…
245
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,990
Sasuke…
246
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,690
Sasuke!
247
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,760
If you want to fight me, don’t lose!
248
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,130
Sasuke… You’re acting strange…
249
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,770
Is it because of the Curse Mark…?
250
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Sasuke, do your best!
251
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,140
I guess I’ll wait and see…
252
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,210
The pain won’t go away!
253
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,250
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
254
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,050
Now then, we will begin the first battle.
255
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,190
Everyone other than the two foes,
please move to the upper area.
256
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,470
Hey! Kakashi Sensei!
257
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,310
Sasuke!
258
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,510
Huh?
259
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,920
Don’t use the Sharingan.
260
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,550
So you knew?
261
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,820
If that Curse Mark on your neck
gets out of control,
262
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,320
it could endanger your life.
263
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,230
I believe it.
264
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,470
Well, the match will be
called off at that time.
265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,540
I’ll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.
266
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,200
Called off, you say?!
267
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,550
It seems this Curse Mark thing
is responding to my Chakra.
268
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,860
This is my final Chakra…
269
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Sharingan!
270
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,630
Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!
271
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
If I carelessly build up Chakra,
272
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,540
it would extract my spirit energy,
273
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,510
and bring out the Chakra
inside my body to no end.
274
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,180
In other words, in this match,
275
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,250
I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,
not to mention the Sharingan!
276
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:10,990
However... Yoroi’s ability is
the worst for you, Sasuke.
277
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,940
Now then… How will I go…?
278
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,580
Don’t act rashly…Sasuke.
279
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,160
Now then, please begin.
280
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,220
Let’s go!
281
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,730
Yeah!
282
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,710
Oh no!
283
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,560
He did it!
284
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,270
My strength…?!
285
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,050
W-What is this?
286
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,220
My body strength has suddenly…!
287
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,990
Sasuke!
288
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,600
Sasuke…!
289
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,540
You…my Chakra…
290
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,540
You just noticed now…?
291
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,760
Hey, can you hear it?
292
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:32,000
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
293
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:41,540
The ocean spans limitlessly
294
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:49,890
Please keep that smile on your face forever
295
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,830
Or else I’ll cry
296
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,700
You won't have to search around you
297
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,470
It’s all ok now.
298
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:13,310
Everyone is inside
this hand
299
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,550
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
300
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,220
When you forget what happiness is
301
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,020
Just sing.
302
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,500
Light is born, and darkness was born
303
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,600
The two are one
304
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,070
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
305
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,580
Hey, can you hear it?
306
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,380
Dang it!
The pain won't go away!
307
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,850
This darned Curse Mark is
responding all the time!
308
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,520
But I won't let this
exam get called off!
309
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,090
How will I do?
How should I fight?
310
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,200
Am I strong?
311
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,260
All I want is the answer to that.
312
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,840
I won't let this thing swallow me up
in a place like this!
313
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,440
Next episode: "Bushy-Brow's Jealousy --
Lions Barrage Unleashed!"
//%
1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,190
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,090
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,200
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,960
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,140
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,170
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,450
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,020
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,410
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,210
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,380
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,720
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
The waves of pain are coming faster...
20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,920
Sasuke, you should quit
the preliminaries!
21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,890
Huh?!
22
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,590
L-Look, you haven't been yourself
23
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,460
ever since you got worked over
by that Orochimaru guy!
24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,970
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
25
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,530
To think it’d be so soon…?!
26
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,910
I couldn’t ask for more.
27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,140
For the 1st battle,
28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,810
Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha
have been selected.
29
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,050
No objections, right?
30
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,220
- Right!
-No!
31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,520
The pain won’t go away!
32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,560
Don’t use the Sharingan.
34
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,270
So you knew?
35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,540
If that Curse Mark on
your neck gets out of control,
36
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,770
it could endanger your life.
37
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,770
I believe it.
38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,110
Well, the match will be
called off at that time.
39
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,350
I’ll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.
40
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,650
Called off, you say?!
41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,860
It seems this Curse Mark thing
is responding to my Chakra.
42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,530
In other words, in this match,
43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
I can hardly use even
my regular Jutsu,
44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,570
not to mention the Sharingan!
45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:18,610
However… Yoroi’s ability is
the worst for you, Sasuke.
46
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,650
Now then, please begin.
47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,570
You… my Chakra…
48
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,540
You just noticed now…?
49
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,310
Bushy-Brow's Jealousy -
Lions Barrage Unleashed!
50
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,710
You… my Chakra…
51
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,980
You just noticed now…?
52
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,760
Yes…Yoroi has unorthodox ability
to absorb Chakra.
53
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,530
It’s a magnificent art that
absorbs spiritual and physical energy
54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,630
simply by holding his palm against
an opponent’s body.
55
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,840
And, if all of your Chakra
is absorbed, Sasuke,
56
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,680
you’ll be forced to rely upon
the power of my Curse Mark…
57
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,690
Now, release that luscious power…!
58
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,360
That is the only way
you have to survive.
59
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,860
You…little!
60
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,570
To think you still have strength left…
61
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,140
Though you’re just a guinea pig.
62
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,710
That was a close one…
63
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,050
Put your mind at ease…
I’ll end this right away!
64
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,230
What’s the matter, what’s the matter?!
65
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,640
You already finished?!
66
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,210
His aim is one, close-quarter fight.
67
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,150
What should I do!?
68
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,350
At this rate, things will go downhill…
69
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,860
Sasuke Uchiha…
ls this the best you can do?
70
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,590
Sasuke…
71
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,870
Sasuke!
72
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,740
You call yourself an Uchiha with that?
73
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,010
Don’t be looking so lame!
74
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,340
Give your best!
75
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,510
That guy…
76
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,550
That’s it!
77
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,390
Oh!
78
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,960
You can’t afford to be inattentive!
79
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
I’ll finish you with this!
80
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,540
Is this as far as it goes…?
81
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,720
He…vanished?!
82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
That’s my…!
83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,060
What?!
84
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Huh?
85
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,740
But then…from here on is my original.
86
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,910
It’s over…
87
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,380
The Dancing Leaf Shadow…?!
88
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,010
Eat this!
89
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,190
Dang it…!
lt’s responding every time…
90
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Please…!
91
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,550
I’m begging you…
92
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,550
Stop!
93
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,730
You! Sasuke!
Don’t be looking so lame!
94
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,640
To think they’d be worried about me…
95
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Is this it…?
96
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,710
I won’t be swallowed up…
by this thing...
97
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,010
No way!
98
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,890
The Curse Mark receded!?
99
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Here I go!
100
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
You’re weak!
101
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,670
You’re weak.
102
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,550
I’m not done, yet!
103
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,760
Lions Barrage!
104
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,090
There’s no need to check.
105
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,540
I’m stopping the match from
going any further…
106
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,880
Therefore, the winner of the
first battle, Sasuke Uchiha…
107
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,920
passes the preliminaries!
108
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,820
Yes!
109
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,600
Well. Good job…
110
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,840
Before that Lions Barrage,
111
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,810
your movements were that
of Guy’s Taijutsu…
112
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,650
So you copied it with the Sharingan
113
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,490
when you wrangled that one time
with that Lee kid?
114
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,760
Sasuke! You, you…
115
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,000
won in a lame way!
116
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,570
Look at you, all battered up!
You idiot!
117
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,540
Man, that loser…
118
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,510
Sasuke…Thank goodness.
119
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,380
Okay, I’ll win, too!
120
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,350
Lee… Because of you,
I’ve managed to save my neck.
121
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,320
Things would’ve gotten hairy
122
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,090
if I hadn’t seen your technique
in close-quarters combat.
123
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,000
But it doesn’t appear to be a technique
that I can use heavily.
124
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,540
I see… So before, he copied a part
of the technique I only used once?
125
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,350
Sharingan!
126
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
That’s your ability…
127
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,420
Sasuke… you’re quite a person.
128
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,960
You get rapidly stronger…
129
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,400
I kind of…feel a bit of fear.
130
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,940
For a sequence of
high-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,
131
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,970
it’s impossible to acquire this
without training
132
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,840
that whittles away flesh and blood.
133
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,510
No matter how much you
use the Sharingan,
134
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,550
it can’t just be mastered in
a short space of time…
135
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,980
Moreover, his idea for that
finishing move…
136
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,560
Kakashi… this boy reminds me
of when you were a kid…
137
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,070
Last year’s number one rookie
was Neji Hyuga.
138
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,900
This year’s number one rookie
is Sasuke Uchiha.
139
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,140
I wonder which one is stronger…?
140
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,710
Really, he’s something else.
141
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,150
To think he’d develop the true power
of the Sharingan in situation like this…
142
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,720
What’s most to be feared…
is the Uchiha ability?
143
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,460
That was surprising…
144
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
To think he brought the Curse Mark
that was getting out of control
145
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,970
into submission with his will…
146
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,840
Tsk. Again?
147
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,850
It just make it more interesting!
148
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,550
Yeah! He is Sasuke after all…
149
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,990
This is as far as we’ll go…
150
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,460
I’m hungry…
151
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,360
W-Wow!
152
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,190
Nothing special.
153
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,670
Magnificent…
154
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,670
Sasuke Uchiha...
155
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,080
We medics will give you
the best of treatment.
156
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,850
You guys are out of your territory.
157
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,680
Huh?!
158
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,050
I’ll take him under my care…
159
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,820
Now, I’ll take you into the back…
160
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,820
and seal the Curse Mark.
161
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,960
Can we wait until
the preliminaries are over?!
162
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,630
I want to watch the matches
of those who will remain in the main battle.
163
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,060
No!
164
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
Don’t get so heated.
165
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,970
If we let things be
any further,
166
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,540
the situation might become irrevocable.
167
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,470
I won’t accommodate you anymore.
168
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,940
Now then, come on…
169
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,680
Sasuke…
170
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,560
Hm?
171
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,850
Sakura... Speaking of which,
during the match…
172
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,550
did you see something that looked
like a strange wound on Sasuke’s neck?
173
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,190
What?
174
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,130
Please promise me…
175
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,900
Don’t say anything about
this bruise to Naruto.
176
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,700
What?
177
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,900
Listen… this is also teamwork.
178
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,540
It won’t do to have him
unnecessarily worried.
179
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,210
I-I don’t know either.
180
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,140
I see…
181
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,120
Umm, now then…
182
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,720
We will get right to it and
begin the second match.
183
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,540
Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame
184
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,510
Which weakling is it?!
185
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,760
Both of you, come forward.
186
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,560
We will now begin the second match.
187
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,900
That’s the Sound Ninja…
188
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,140
The guy who had both
his arms broken by Sasuke!
189
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,950
It seems like you’re proud
of your arms…
190
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,420
You!
191
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,150
S-Stop it!
192
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,900
He’s going to fight with those arms?
193
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,740
I wonder if Shino is going to be okay…
194
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,940
He’s fine. He’s strong!
195
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,710
What…?
196
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,540
I’d square off with anybody except him…
197
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,550
Now then, please begin.
198
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,980
Now, Zaku…
199
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,550
How you fight will be a sight to see…
200
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,580
If you fight here,
you’ll be finished…
201
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,480
Withdraw!
202
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,580
Somehow, this one still works, so…
203
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,230
One arm is enough to take care of you!
204
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,270
You can’t beat me with
just one arm.
205
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,970
Stop pestering me!
206
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Take this!
207
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,310
Slicing Sound Wave!
208
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,880
Okay.
209
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,450
Hang in there.
lt’ll be over right away.
210
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,060
Curse Sealing!
211
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,190
Next time, even if that Curse Mark
starts kicking in again…
212
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,330
the power of this Curse Sealing
should suppress it.
213
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,540
However, this Sealing Jutsu makes
the strength of your will its foundation.
214
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,710
If something happens like
you not believing in your own strength
215
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,210
and that will were to weaken…
216
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,110
the Curse Mark will
once again start to rage.
217
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,550
Out of character.
218
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,320
It appears he’s quite tired…
219
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,820
To think you’ve become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu…
220
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?
221
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,240
You…
222
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,550
Long time no see, Kakashi.
223
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,550
Orochimaru…
224
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,130
Hey, can you hear it?
225
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:32,400
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
226
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,880
The ocean spans limitlessly
227
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:50,250
Please keep that smile on your face forever
228
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:57,190
Or else I’ll cry
229
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,060
You won't have to search around you
230
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,600
It’s all ok now.
231
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:13,540
Everyone is inside
this hand
232
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,020
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
233
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,550
When you forget what happiness is
234
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,390
Just sing.
235
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,630
Light is born, and darkness was born
236
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,960
The two are one
237
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:41,440
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
238
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,940
Hey, can you hear it?
239
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,350
This is surprising.
240
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,550
I never thought you’d appear.
241
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,560
Why are you after Sasuke?
What’s your purpose?!
242
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,060
Even though you’re one of
the legendary three Ninja,
243
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,560
I must not retreat.
244
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,730
I’ll stop you here,
even if it costs my life!
245
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,170
Next episode: “Kakashi and Orochimaru:
Face-to-Face!”
246
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,540
Well, it’s sink or swim.

00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,272
<i>Inside my heart is pounding</i>
5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,008
<i>My throat dry like it's withering</i>
6
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:35,812
<i>For no single one,</i>
7
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:39,587
<i>To none does belong,</i>
8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,326
<i>This time is ours, right now...</i>
9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,832
<i>Unraveling the pain,</i>
10
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:51,664
<i>Unraveling our hearts,</i>
11
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:54,069
<i>Unraveling shadows</i>
12
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:57,371
<i>Stifling our breath,</i>
13
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,343
<i>Reaching for beyond,</i>
14
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,845
<i>Tearing through the dark</i>
15
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:10,313
<i>In fighting and in love</i>
16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,918
<i>To the distant light above,</i>
17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,557
<i>Yes, we are on the way</i>
18
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,598
<i>I wanna rock...</i>
19
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,695
<i>Rockin' my heart</i>
20
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,523
It looks like you've got some time
to kill there all by yourself.
21
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,732
What happened to the blond boy
and that stuck up boy?
22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,892
They're in the middle of
the tree-climbing training.
23
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,630
You don't have to do that?
24
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,297
I'm exceptional, so Kakashi Sensei
told me to guard you.
25
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,404
Really?
26
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,843
What?!
27
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,439
You got a minute, Tazuna?
28
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,209
Huh? What's up, Giichi?
29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,478
Uh, actually...
30
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,023
I gave it a lot of thought.
31
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:29,087
Building this bridge...
will you let me quit?
32
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:33,328
Why so suddenly? Not you too?!
33
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,427
Tazuna, I've had a bond
with you from the old days.
34
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,201
I'd like to cooperate,
but if we push it too far,
35
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:42,673
Gato will set his sights
on us, too.
36
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:49,014
Also... if you get killed,
everything is lost!
37
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,948
Why don't you just
stop building the bridge?
38
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,416
Not a chance...
39
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,388
This is our bridge.
40
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,068
This is the bridge that
everyone in town has built
41
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:12,296
believing that it would generate
distribution and transportation
42
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,636
for this poor Land of Waves
that has few resources.
43
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,707
But if it goes so far as
to take our lives...
44
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,908
It's already afternoon...
45
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:21,813
Let's call it a day.
46
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:24,642
Tazuna!
47
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,586
Giichi... you don't have to
come back tomorrow.
48
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:41,365
<i>The Land Where a Hero Once Lived</i>
49
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:44,736
Damn it!
50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,308
What the heck is up with this?
51
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,126
<i>I won't lose to you!</i>
52
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:26,308
Say, where are we going?
53
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,980
I was asked to get some ingredients
for dinner on the way home...
54
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:32,516
WILL DO ANY KIND OF WORK
55
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,851
Thief!
56
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,752
<i>What's up with... this town?</i>
57
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,288
We're here...
58
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,333
Welcome...
59
00:04:58,311 --> 00:04:59,938
<i>There's hardly anything here...</i>
60
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,951
You pervert!!
61
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,084
You're... wrong...
62
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,524
Man, I was really surprised earlier.
63
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,694
What's going on with this town?!
64
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:23,494
<i>Again?</i>
65
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,262
Hey, you...
66
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:29,831
What?
67
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,309
Gimme some!
68
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:45,817
Oh... Here...
69
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:47,924
Yaaay!
70
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:50,720
Thank you.
71
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,270
This is how it's been ever
since Gato showed up.
72
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:02,371
Here, all the adults
have turned into cowards.
73
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:12,043
So that's why now
that bridge is necessary...
74
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,419
It's a symbol of bravery...
75
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,114
in order to restore their spirit,
so they don't keep running away...
76
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,681
For the people of this land...
77
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,693
who have set their minds
on remaining passive...
78
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:29,464
If we can just...
complete that bridge...
79
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,262
this town will return to
how it once was...
80
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,340
and everyone will come back.
81
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,845
<i>Sasuke... Naruto...</i>
82
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:07,700
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>
83
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,407
<i>Are you telling me that</i>
<i>Sasuke's still climbing?!</i>
84
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:15,872
<i>Darn it...</i>
85
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,809
<i>He's gradually catching up...</i>
86
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,583
<i>Darn it! No! No!</i>
87
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:28,193
<i>If I let myself get distracted by Sasuke,</i>
<i>my concentration will be disturbed!</i>
88
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,093
Hey Sakura,
can you give me some tips?
89
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:35,032
Huh?
90
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,996
Without telling Sasuke, okay, okay?
91
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:40,466
Listen.
92
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:45,805
Chakra uses spiritual energy,
so you mustn't get too strained or frantic.
93
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,475
Relax and concentrate on the tree
so that you can constantly accumulate
94
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,779
a fixed amount of Chakra
in the bottom of your feet.
95
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:54,346
<i>Concentrate!</i>
<i>Concentrate!</i>
96
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:57,179
<i>Okay. I'm getting good vibes, I say!</i>
97
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,257
<i>Okay! This is it!</i>
98
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,187
Hey... Naruto!
99
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:05,424
Jeez, what the heck's
wrong with you?!
100
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,665
Don't interfere while
I'm trying to concentrate!
101
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:11,232
U... Uh... Well...
102
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,729
W-What is it?!
103
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:18,343
<i>I'm not used to</i>
<i>him speaking to me first...</i>
104
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,239
Y-You asked Sakura to give
you some tips before...
105
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,579
What did she say to you?
106
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:33,623
I'm not telling!
107
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,541
Man...
108
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,134
This is really fun!
109
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:55,442
It's been a long time since we've had
a meal with this many people!
110
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,019
Seconds please!
111
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,189
Stop eating if you're going to vomit!
112
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,164
No, I'll eat.
113
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,933
I have to eat even
if it means enduring.
114
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,826
I have to get strong
as quickly as possible, so...
115
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,606
Yes yes!
116
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:23,606
But vomiting is different.
117
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:34,119
Excuse me, why is there
a torn picture hanging here?
118
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,921
Inari was looking at this
all through dinner.
119
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,187
This torn part looks like someone who was
in the picture was deliberately torn off.
120
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:49,399
It's my husband...
121
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,663
He's a man who was
once called a hero of this town...
122
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,003
Inari! Where are you going?
123
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,182
Dad!
124
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,354
I'm always telling you not to
talk about that person in front of Inari!
125
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,363
What're you saying happened with Inari?
126
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:29,169
It appears there's
some kind of good reason.
127
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,277
Inari had a father
not related by blood...
128
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:38,777
It was like they were a real father
and son who got along really well...
129
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:45,216
Back then, Inari was a child
who laughed all the time...
130
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:48,122
However...
131
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,025
However...
132
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:03,203
Inari has changed...
ever since that incident with his father.
133
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,406
The word bravery was eternally taken
134
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:14,853
from the people of this island
and from Inari...
135
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,189
With that day,
that incident, as the trigger.
136
00:11:19,326 --> 00:11:22,295
That incident?
What happened to Inari?
137
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:26,531
To explain the incident,
I must first...
138
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:31,704
tell you about the man
who was called the hero of this land.
139
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,204
Hero?
140
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,075
It was around three years ago...
141
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:39,212
when Inari met the man...
142
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:42,912
Potchi!!
143
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,913
Potchi!!
144
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:47,315
Wrong!
145
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,882
His name's Shooting Star...
146
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,882
As of today, he's my dog!
147
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,458
He's not Shooting Star!
He's my Potchi! Give him back!
148
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,420
Potchi's my friend!
149
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,893
Who's going to give him
to the likes of you?!
150
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:02,800
Shut up!
151
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,404
Potchi!!
152
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:16,612
That's cuz you wouldn't
hand him over quietly...
153
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:19,176
Now I couldn't care less
about that dog!
154
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,519
Hey, let him go!
155
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:26,320
What have you done?!
Are you trying to kill Potchi?!
156
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,929
Heh! He's your special mutt, right?
157
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,993
Then save him, quick.
158
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,634
What's the matter?
159
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,862
Is it okay with you if he dies?!
160
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:46,806
<i>Of course I'm not okay</i>
<i>with him dying!</i>
161
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,675
<i>He's my only friend!</i>
162
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,448
- <i>But...</i>
- Look. He can't even dog paddle
163
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,749
- even though he's a dog!
- <i>But...</i>
164
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,955
<i>I'm sorry, Potchi...</i>
<i>I can't swim...</i>
165
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:03,087
Hey! If you're his owner,
dive in after him!
166
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,138
This is bad, Akane.
What if he can't swim?
167
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,308
S-Save me!
168
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:18,570
Leave him be.
169
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:20,172
B-But...
170
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,942
Then why don't <i>you</i> go
save him if you like?
171
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:30,084
<i>I-I don't want to die...</i>
<i>Somebody save me!</i>
172
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:34,191
P-Potchi!
173
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:36,786
Potchi!
174
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:38,888
I'm gonna digress, but...
175
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,498
Potchi learned
how to dog paddle then.
176
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:47,338
Potchi!
177
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,549
Shooting Star escaped. Get him!
178
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:12,188
<i>Ohhh... I can't breathe...</i>
<i>This... is it...</i>
179
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,031
Are you awake, boy?
180
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,607
I gave those kids
a good scolding.
181
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,476
Here, eat!
182
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,180
<i>Is this God? Oh...</i>
183
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:37,815
Did you... save me?
184
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,685
Just eat! Start with that.
185
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:46,458
I see. You were betrayed
by your dog, too...
186
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:51,102
In my country, dogs are creatures
that have a keen sense of loyalty...
187
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:54,673
Well, you betrayed
your dog's trust first,
188
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,208
so there's nothing
you can do about that.
189
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:00,607
I was scared and couldn't move.
190
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,978
I wanted to save him...
191
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:08,114
But... I have no guts, so...
192
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:09,547
That's right.
193
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,884
Of course a kid your age
would be scared.
194
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:16,688
But you know... boy.
195
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,125
Just remember this.
196
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,098
Huh?
197
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:23,966
If you're a man choose
a lifestyle you won't regret...
198
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,835
For things I truly
hold dear to myself,
199
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:32,307
I'll protect them until the very end
with both these arms.
200
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,572
Even if it's tough, or sad,
I'll stick it out...
201
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:38,277
even if it looks like
I might lose my life!
202
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,347
His name was Kaiza and
203
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:49,128
he was a fisherman who'd come to this land
from another country in search of his dreams.
204
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:53,191
After that, Inari really took to Kaiza.
205
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,762
It may have been because Inari
had lost his real father
206
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,771
when he was too young
to remember anything.
207
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:02,132
But he was very attached to Kaiza.
208
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,608
They were like father and son...
209
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:08,276
It didn't take long
for Kaiza to become...
210
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:10,717
a member of the family.
211
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:16,687
And he was a man
this town needed.
212
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,456
We... we've got trouble, Kaiza!
213
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,855
The river dam has broken
from this rain!
214
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:24,528
At this rate,
District D will be consumed!
215
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:25,524
What?!
216
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:26,389
Dad!
217
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
Inari, go out back and
get some rope!
218
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:29,167
Okay!
219
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:30,728
Its no good!
220
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,835
The only thing we can do is
to attach a rope and pull...
221
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,867
Don't talk nonsense!
How are we going to attach a rope?!
222
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,974
We'd die if we were to go
into such a furious current!
223
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:42,010
But if we drag our feet,
District D will be annihilated!
224
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,440
What should we do?
225
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:44,643
I'll do it.
226
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,080
Kaiza!
227
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:49,748
Don't be foolish!
228
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:51,752
Even you wouldn't be able to!
229
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,218
Dad!
230
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,054
Don't worry...
231
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:57,261
Your dad's unmatched.
232
00:16:57,864 --> 00:17:01,595
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so...
233
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,435
<i>For things I truly hold dear to myself...</i>
234
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,210
<i>Even if I lose my life...</i>
235
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:25,357
<i>I'll protect them to the end...</i>
<i>with both these arms!</i>
236
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,859
Dad, hang in there!
237
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:40,463
He did it!
The rope... the rope's attached!
238
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,440
Okay, everybody pull!
239
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,533
Yeah!
240
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:48,744
From then on... the people of this land
called Kaiza a hero.
241
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:53,115
And he became a father
that Inari could be proud of.
242
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:58,181
It was around that time when Gato
set his sights on this land.
243
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:01,119
And then, one night...
244
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,502
I heard...
245
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,712
That you're going to protect
this town with those arms...
246
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,346
I dare you to!
247
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:01,120
Listen up!
248
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:05,857
This man resisted through force,
the policies of the Gato corporation
249
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:08,053
and disturbed the order
of this nation.
250
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:11,323
Therefore, he will now be executed!
251
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:22,204
I just hope that such trivial matters
will never occur again.
252
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,234
Dad!
253
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,171
Stop, Inari...
254
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:34,047
Do it...
255
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:39,085
Dad...
256
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,922
Dad!
257
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,798
Didn't you tell me?
258
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,806
That you'd... protect...
259
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:12,416
me and the people of this land...
with both your arms?
260
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:16,023
Dad, you liar...
261
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,431
Ever since then,
Inari has changed...
262
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,705
as well as Tsunami...
and the townspeople...
263
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:35,280
Hero, that's just stupid.
There's no such thing!
264
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,029
What're you doing, Naruto?
265
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:58,893
You've had enough training for today.
You've built up too much Chakra.
266
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,963
You'll die if you move
any more than that.
267
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,672
I'll prove it.
268
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,342
Prove what?
269
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:10,071
I'll prove that...
270
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,448
there <i>are</i> heroes...
271
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:18,217
in this world!
272
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,599
Huh? What do you want, lady?
273
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,431
As for me, I'm training right now.
274
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,602
Cuz we don't know when
Zabuza will strike next...
275
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,473
Getting strong for someone special
is something I understand very well.
276
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,275
So I'm going to get
stronger and stronger.
277
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,012
I'll show Inari that there are heroes
in this world.
278
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,655
Next time:
"Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!"
279
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,320
As for me, I'm going to
kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,820
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,930
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,200
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,610
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,280
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,010
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,820
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,660
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,030
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,830
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,330
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,700
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,670
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,110
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,680
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,190
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,820
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,000
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,900
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,420
You have to think when using Jutsu.
21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,020
They can be used against you.
22
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,230
Also, don't get caught
in an obvious trap, you fool.
23
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,900
A Ninja must see
through deception…got it?
24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,130
I know that!
25
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,840
You know, you say that because
you don't get it. Listen up.
26
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,210
Your movements are wasteful.
27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,810
Now!
28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,320
He finally dropped his guard!
29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,420
You're so...
30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,820
No way!
31
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,530
You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it.
32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,440
Damn! Another substitution…?
33
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,110
He must have found out my location
with those Shuriken!
34
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,810
He purposely lowered his guard!
Serves me right…
35
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,110
I fell for the trap.
36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,380
So he's over there, eh…
37
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,620
Sasuke…Where are you…?!
38
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,090
Don't tell me,
Kakashi Sensei already…
39
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,830
No!
40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,530
That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!
41
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,870
Safe! He didn't notice me.
42
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,500
Sakura, behind you.
43
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:11,900
Huh?!
44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,410
What's up with that "A Ninja must see
through deception" stuff?!
45
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,150
Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again!
46
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,190
I fell for it again!
47
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,260
You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision
48
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,120
What was that?! Huh?!
49
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,660
Hold on! Where's Sensei?!
50
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,020
Huh?! What's going on?!
51
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
Huh?! What's what?!
52
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,760
Sakura…
53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,830
Sasuke?!
54
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,730
Sa…Saku…ra…
55
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,340
P-Please…help…me…
56
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,280
Maybe I went a bit overboard…
57
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,020
But it's really something
she should notice…
58
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,020
Was that voice…Sakura's…?
59
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,630
Shinobi Battle Skill ♪2, Genjutsu.
60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,830
Sakura was easily lured.
61
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,170
Genjutsu, huh...?
62
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,800
An illusory mind-controlling technique.
I'm not surprised she got lured.
63
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,800
However…
64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,710
I'm different from them.
65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,020
Why don't you say that after
you get a bell…Sasuke?
66
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,080
It's no use just using
straightforward attacks.
67
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,180
A trap?!
68
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,450
What?!
69
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,740
This guy's...?!
70
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,840
What a guy.
71
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,810
There's no time
to read "Make-Out Paradise."
72
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,250
What…? 					I…?!
73
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,230
That's right! I saw Sasuke on
the verge of dying and I…
74
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,030
Sasuke!
Don't die and leave me here!!
75
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,030
Where are you?!
76
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,440
So that's what it looks like
behind the logs.
77
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,280
Oh! There are box lunches on the stone!
78
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,020
A Ninja must see through deception... eh?
79
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,630
Well! I'll acknowledge that
you're different from those two.
80
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,400
Horse!
81
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,830
Tiger!
82
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,370
Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!
83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,810
What?! That's not a Jutsu
that a Genin can do…
84
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,040
He shouldn't have
enough Chakra yet!
85
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,730
He's gone!
ls he behind me?! No, above me?!
86
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,160
Where is he?!
87
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,060
I'm under you!!
88
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:36,830
Wha--?!
89
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,900
Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu.
90
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,150
Shinobi Battle Skill ♪3, Ninjutsu.
91
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,620
How's that? You can't move, heh?
92
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,360
Although, you're…already starting
to make your mark.
93
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,490
But, oh well.
94
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,830
They do say that the nail that sticks up
gets hammered down, so…
95
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,800
Damn it!
96
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,810
I don't have to naively take those bells.
I'll just eat in secret right now!
97
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,580
Let's eat!!
98
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,250
Hey.
99
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,620
I was just joking…
100
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Too late!
101
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,290
Darn it…! Is there this much of
a difference in strength…?
102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Sakura...
103
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,270
This time it's a freshly severed head?!
104
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,880
What's up with her?
105
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,490
Sasuke?
106
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,960
You're okay!
107
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,830
Hey, cut it out!
Don't cling to me!
108
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,530
There's not much time left until noon.
I'm going.
109
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Sasuke, you're still going
after the bells?!
110
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,470
I was able to touch them last time.
Next time I'll be able to take them.
111
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,580
What?! 					I-I see.
112
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,380
Sure enough,
you're awesome, Sasuke.
113
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,820
There's no way I can take
the bells from Sensei.
114
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,720
At this rate, I'll face
separation from Sasuke…
115
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,830
Uh…say. There's really no time left…
116
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,260
So let's just take it easy and
try again next time.
117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,830
I'm the only one
who can kill that man.
118
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,900
Huh…? What?
You mean Sensei?
119
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,800
At that time…I was crying.
120
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,040
Crying…?
121
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,040
My…
122
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,950
What…? What is it…?
123
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,820
I'm an avenger. I must become stronger
than that man…
124
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,020
I don't have time for setbacks here...
125
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,830
...to kill a certain man!
126
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,000
Damn it…I wasted my time talking.
127
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,170
Sasuke...
128
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,480
Oh-oh, your stomachs are growling…
129
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,950
By the way, about this exercise…
130
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,790
Well! There's no need for you guys
to go back to the Academy.
131
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,830
What? I… All I did was lay unconscious.
132
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,700
Is that okay?
133
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,840
Love is victorious!! Cha!!
134
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,540
Yahooooo!
135
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,080
Then, then!
That means the three of us…
136
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,810
Yes. The three of you…
137
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,680
must quit being Ninja!!
138
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,490
N-No way!
139
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,570
Kakashi hasn't passed
a single person this whole time…
140
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,030
Iruka…
141
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:10,070
Even I don't know if it's good for
those kids to become Shinobi right away…
142
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,650
However…
Kakashi's judgments were correct…
143
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,250
Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?!
144
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,320
Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to
take the bells.
145
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,790
But why do we have to be told to "quit"?!
146
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,830
That's because you're all squirts who
don't have the qualifications to become Ninja.
147
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,830
Oh!
148
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,830
Sasuke!
149
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,540
I'm saying you're squirts.
150
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,480
Don't step on Sasuke!!
151
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,450
Are you kids thinking that
being a Ninja is easy? Huh?
152
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,220
Why do you think you're doing
this exercise in teams?
153
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,630
Huh?! What do you mean?
154
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,990
Put simply…
155
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,330
it's as if you guys have no
understanding of the answer to this test.
156
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,830
Answer…?
157
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,810
Yes. The answer that determines
passing or failing of this test.
158
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,810
That's…what I've wanted to ask
about for a while now.
159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,410
Man, are you guys brainless or what?
160
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,980
Don't you get the meaning of
the three-man squad?!
161
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,860
Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?!
162
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,830
That's…teamwork!
163
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,260
You mean, working together?
164
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,700
Exactly. But it's too late even
if you realize that now.
165
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
You might've been able to…
166
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,100
take the bells if the three of you
had come at me…
167
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,770
Well, it's too bad.
168
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,810
Now wait a minute.
169
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,450
Why use teamwork if
there were only two bells?
170
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,750
If the three of us were to desperately go
take the bells with one having to hold back,
171
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,820
that wouldn't be teamwork.
That'd create internal discord.
172
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,350
Of course!
173
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,990
This is a test set up to purposely
place you against each other.
174
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,960
It's under just such conditions
where one's own interests aren't the issue.
175
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,800
The intention was to select those
who could prioritize teamwork…
176
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Despite this, you fools…
177
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,870
Sakura!
178
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,340
You were only concerned with Sasuke and
you didn't even know where he was.
179
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,810
And you didn't care for Naruto who was
right in front of your eyes…
180
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,480
Naruto!
181
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,320
All you do is run solo…
182
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,820
You labeled the other two as hindrances
and acted on your own…
183
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,130
Missions are carried out in squads!
184
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,560
There's no mistaking that Ninjas need
unsurpassed individual skills…
185
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,830
But "teamwork" is considered
more important than that.
186
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,570
Individual actions that disrupt teamwork
throw the team into crisis and lead to death…
187
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,710
For example...
188
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,650
"Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies…"
189
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,950
What?! What?! Whaaat?!
190
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,350
Is what will…happen.
191
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,420
Oh, I was so surpised.
192
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,030
On top of having a hostage taken,
193
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,830
you're faced with two impossible choices
and end up being killed.
194
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,100
Every mission is
a life-risking assignment.
195
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,840
Look at this…
196
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,110
The many names engraved
on this stone…
197
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,080
These are all Ninjas who are called
heroes in the village.
198
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,820
That-that-that-that! I like thaaat!
199
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,620
I've decided now to get
my name engraved there, too!
200
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,830
A hero! A hero!
I'm not going to die like a dog!
201
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,830
But…they're not just ordinary heroes.
202
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,000
No kidding. Then, what kind
of heroes are they?
203
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,540
Hey! Hey!
204
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,470
They are heroes
who were killed in action.
205
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,240
Killed in action?
206
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,610
It means they died
performing a mission.
207
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,220
This is a memorial.
208
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,230
The names of my friends
are also engraved here...
209
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,810
I'll give you guys one more chance!
210
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,880
However, after noon it'll be
a harsher battle to take the bell.
211
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Those who want to take on
the challenge can eat lunch.
212
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,190
However, don't let Naruto have any.
213
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,460
It's punishment for breaking the rules and
attempting to eat lunch on your own.
214
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,160
If someone lets him eat…
215
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,830
that person will be disqualified
on the spot.
216
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,810
I make the rules, here. Got it?!
217
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,810
I must be going.
218
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,380
Listen to me, Iruka.
219
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,810
What?
220
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,320
No matter what the result,
don't hold it against Kakashi…
221
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,650
Alright.
222
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,710
I'm okay with not eating lunch!
No sweat at all!
223
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,140
No sweat…
224
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,780
Here.
225
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,790
H-Hey, Sasuke.
Sensei just said…!
226
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,630
It's okay.
There's no sign of him now.
227
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,500
The three of us are going to go
take the bells together.
228
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,200
It'll be trouble for me
if he becomes a hindrance, so...
229
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,500
Sasuke…
230
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,150
Sakura…
231
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,990
Thanks…
232
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,190
Don't thank me.
Just hurry up and eat.
233
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,400
But…
234
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,830
I'm on…a diet…
I mean I just eat less than Sasuke.
235
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,600
So you don't need to worry.
236
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,600
But…
237
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,810
See…
238
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,270
Wha--?!
239
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
Hurry it up.
We don't know when he'll be back…
240
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,410
It's just this one time.
241
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,120
Okay? You got it?!
242
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,790
I got it.
243
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,060
You three!
244
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,830
Yiiikes!
245
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,810
You defied the rules so that
means you know what's coming…
246
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,710
Do you have…something to say?
247
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,120
But you see…
248
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,490
What?!
249
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,830
But! But! But!
You said, Sensei!
250
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,590
These guys…
251
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,830
We're a three-man squad, right?
252
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,330
That's right!
The three of us are one, so…!
253
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,370
That's right! That's right!
That's right!
254
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,940
That's right!
255
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,110
The three of you are one, eh…
256
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,820
You pass!
257
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:09,820
What?!
258
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,120
Whaaat?!
259
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,820
You pass!
260
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,160
We passed?! Why?!
261
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,830
You guys are the first.
262
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,900
Up until now, it was always just dunces
who would meekly listen to what I said.
263
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,640
A Ninja must see through deception…
264
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,540
In the world of Ninja,
265
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,580
those who break rules and codes
are branded as garbage…
266
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,280
But…
267
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,790
Those who don't cherish their friends are
garbage worse than that.
268
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,130
He's… He's…kinda…cool…
269
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,830
That's it for the exercise…
270
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,100
Everyone passes!
271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,540
Group Seven starts their mission
tomorrow!
272
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,440
Yes, Sir!
273
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,310
I did it!! I'm a Ninja!
Ninja! Ninja!
274
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,180
Let's go home.
275
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,420
Cha!
276
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,590
I...
277
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,760
knew this is how it'd turn out!
278
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,730
Untie the rope!
279
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,730
Oh, please! It'd been nothing but
blah missions until now.
280
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,800
And just when I thought I'd finally
gotten an awesome mission,
281
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,670
to think it'd be bodyguarding
this old man.
282
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,810
He mocks the heck out of me,
calling me a brat.
283
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,840
I'll tell him a thing or two.
284
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,510
Someday I'll be…
Hey, are you listening?!
285
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,320
Next episode: "A Dangerous Mission!
Journey to the Land of Waves!"
286
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,820
Don't miss me kick butt!
//%
1
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,790
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,670
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,210
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,790
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,460
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:46,340
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:55,790
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:06,590
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:15,920
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,090
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,090
Follow My Lead!
The Great Survival Challenge!
12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,960
I-I’ll do my best!
13
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,880
Looks like it’ll be interesting,
huh, Konohamaru?!
14
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,170
Here…Here…
15
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,180
Heck no, heck no!
No way in heck, believe it!
16
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,590
Why should I have to do
some babysitting mission like that?
17
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,510
I don’t care what you say,
Old Lady Tsunade. I refuse!
18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,430
The team organization has already
been announced to the students!
19
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,470
I don’t care about that!
20
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,590
As for me, I want to train more,
get stronger and…
21
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,470
“I’ll become Hokage someday,
believe it,” huh?
22
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
A person like that…
23
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,010
would never betray the expectations
of his adorable juniors, would he?
24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,140
Become a unit leader and
issue appropriate instructions…
25
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,590
Protect the lives of your men
and promptly carry out your mission…
26
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,720
I thought this mission I’m giving you guys…
27
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,760
is ideal practice for becoming Hokage.
28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,970
Ideal practice for becoming…Hokage?
29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,850
If you’re going so far as to say that,
then it can’t be helped…
30
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,010
It’s too bad…
31
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,550
Whoa! Kidding, kidding,
kidding, just kidding!
32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
Say so sooner if that’s the case.
33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,590
Practice for becoming Hokage…
34
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,930
Yeah-yeah…
That has a nice ring to it.
35
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,720
He fell for it.
36
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,930
Jeez, he’s naïve…
37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,350
Naruto…
38
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,590
Now then,
my adorable team members…are…
39
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,390
These guys…?
40
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,550
Oh! Why the heck are you
on that side?!
41
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,590
Man, I don’t want to do such
a troublesome mission either.
42
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,590
Shikamaru will be
an assistant to us instructors.
43
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,590
I will now begin the explanation
of the outdoor training
44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,510
to be conducted over
one night and two days.
45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,970
This is the spot you all
will be setting out for…
46
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,100
Great Stone Face of Warudakumi
on the summit of Mount Takurami.
47
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,390
The team leader will not take routes
other than the ones indicated on the map…
48
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,970
in order to ensure the safety
of the Academy students.
49
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,600
Along the way, there will be obstacles such
as instructors disguised as enemy Ninja,
50
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,550
as well as trap and the like.
51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,800
But you Academy students
should be able to safely evade them
52
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,760
if you act according to the instructions
of your team leaders.
53
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,350
You’ll see
the Stone Face of Warudakumi
54
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,300
after you cover about
eighty kilometers.
55
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,390
The team that brings the secret document
hidden there back to the village…
56
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,430
will have completed the training
upon crossing the finish line.
57
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,720
There is only one secret document.
58
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,890
This will be a competition
with the other teams.
59
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,390
All right.
We’ll finish first, no matter what!
60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,800
You guys ready?!
61
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,100
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
62
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,760
An important thing about survival is
acquiring food with your own resources…
63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,140
This is called Beef Sashimi Grass
and it grows in this area…
64
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,850
You can eat it raw and
65
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,300
it becomes precious food
when the chips are down…
66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,590
– Wow! 					– Wow!
67
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,600
All right! All members acquire food!
68
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,180
– Yay! 					– Yay!
69
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,350
This is it!
70
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,970
Let’s eat…
71
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,590
That’s a Blowfish Sashimi Grass.
lt’s a very similar poisonous grass.
72
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,970
See? The shape of the leaf
is a bit different, right…?
73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,970
You two be careful as well, okay?
74
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,260
– Okay! 					– Okay!
75
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,590
Listen up, an important thing in survival
is to acquire food by your own resources.
76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,590
Something’s not right!
77
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,640
Disappointing, isn’t it…?
78
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,260
I’ve got an uneasy feeling…
79
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,510
Let’s see…
80
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,510
The geography in this area
throws magnets out of kilter…
81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,590
When you can’t use a compass…
82
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,890
Huh?
83
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,590
You’re wearing a watch, right?
84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,640
Oh…yes!
85
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,550
Look for the bisecting angle,
86
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,930
which divides the 12:00 direction and the
current direction of the hour hand in two…
87
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,220
And then, when you line up that direction
with the sun as of now…
88
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,590
the approximate 12:00 direction is south.
89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,890
Remember that!
90
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,470
– Okay! 					– Okay!
91
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,890
Let’s…see…
92
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,510
Huh? This way…?
93
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,180
Hey, Konohamaru…
94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,970
This way?
95
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,600
No doubt about it…
96
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,720
He’s totally lost…
97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,510
Right, right!
98
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,590
Yikes…This is bad, believe it.
99
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,890
A-All right! This way!
100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,140
Come with me, believe it!
101
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,970
Will it be okay?
102
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,260
That was a more challenging route
than I thought, wasn’t it, guys?
103
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,590
Challenging, my foot!
We’re back at where we came from!
104
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,800
Man, we can’t trust you,
Brother Naruto!
105
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,590
Then why don’t you try?!
106
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,390
Give me that!
107
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,010
Oh… It’s this way.
108
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,590
N-Not bad…
109
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,350
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?!
110
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,590
What’re you doing, Konohamaru?!
Give me that!
111
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,850
Sorry… Here.
112
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,680
Let me see…
113
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,510
Oh, it’s that way!
114
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,100
What were you guys doing?!
115
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,100
Hey, we’ve come back again!
116
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,050
What…? How in the world can
we get out of here?!
117
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,010
All right… I’ll do my best!
118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,050
I don’t feel good…
119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,970
Hey!
120
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,350
Good grief…
121
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,430
Are you guys okay?
122
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,180
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
123
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,590
What did you say…just now?!
124
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,510
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
125
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,760
Lee Sensei…!
Ahh, that has such a lovely ring to it.
126
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,180
This is youth, this is extreme youth!
127
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,180
Now, run towards that setting sun!
128
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,720
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,300
Your sweat sparkling in
the setting sun is wonderful!
130
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,930
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
– Yes, Lee Sensei!
131
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,050
Finally made it, huh…?
132
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,300
Now, I guess I’ll check out
Naruto’s team in action.
133
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,590
Now then… Show me what
you’ve learned until now!
134
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,760
Go!
135
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,470
All right! Formation One, Konohamaru!
136
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Sexy Jutsu!
137
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,800
Adults are a cinch with this Jutsu.
138
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,970
You idiot!
139
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,890
You wish, Brother Naruto!
140
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,010
Times are evolving!
141
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,220
New formation!
142
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,590
– Cheesecake Jutsu!
– Cheesecake Jutsu!
143
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,140
Fashion Model!
144
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,010
Movie Star!
145
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,140
Tanning Salon Receptionist!
146
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,010
– We're Cheesecakes!
– We're Cheesecakes!
147
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,590
I’d like to say, just what
I’d expect of my best pupils,
148
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,220
but you still don’t have
enough “bust-waist-hip.”
149
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,260
Jeez…This guy’s such a pain…
as always.
150
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,890
Iruka Sensei!
151
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,430
What is it?
152
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,590
A report from the observatory…
153
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,470
Wow… It’s warm…
154
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,890
Good thing we listened to you
and prepared it ahead of time.
155
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,590
We would’ve been soaked if
156
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,850
we were even a little slow
putting up the tent!
157
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,590
Reading ahead is important for
a Ninja…
158
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,760
In particular, if you don’t acutely
sense the weatherr,
159
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,590
it could end up being fatal,
so be careful.
160
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,100
– Okay! 					– Okay!
161
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,640
What’re you doing, Moegi?
Pull it properly, believe it!
162
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,760
I’ve had it!
I don’t want to do this!
163
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Moegi! Stop saying selfish things
and hold it!
164
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,590
But…
165
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,300
What, really?!
166
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,590
It seems it’s going to directly hit
the Leaf Village before dawn…
167
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,590
Jeez, why now…?!
168
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,010
The communication from
the observatory
169
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,100
was probably delayed due to the storm.
170
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,590
We have no choice, then…
171
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,590
The training is suspended.
172
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,050
Convey the order to all
the teams immediately!
173
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,720
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
174
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,350
Why’d you put the tent away?!
175
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,050
Brother Naruto, what’s the deal?
176
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,430
This path isn’t on the map.
177
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,010
We fell behind the others more
than I thought.
178
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,550
We can’t be resting
179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,300
Then, this path…
180
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,100
Yeah… It’s not on the map.
lt’s a shortcut route!
181
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,390
– What?! 					– What?!
182
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,430
Will this be okay?!
183
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,590
What’re you doing?!
We’ll be late if we don’t hurry!
184
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,550
Don’t talk nonsense!
185
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,470
We haven’t learned that method
of climbing!
186
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,590
Right! Chakra control comes after
we’ve become senior students!
187
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,760
That makes no difference.
You can do anything if you get serious!
188
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,300
Come on! Let’s go!
189
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,590
Damn it…!
190
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,590
Grab on!
191
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,470
Wh-What’re you doing?!
192
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,590
Oh! Let go, Konohamaru!
193
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,720
If I let go, he’ll blow away!
194
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,350
Let go of the bag, Udon!
195
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,800
I-I can’t…!
196
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,720
It can’t be helped…
197
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,590
No! I can’t hold on any longer!
198
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,260
That was a close one!
199
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,180
I issued an evacuation advisory
200
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,800
to all the teams encamped
at the foot of the mountain.
201
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,590
I see… Now all that’s left is
Naruto’s team…
202
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,590
Iruka Sensei!
203
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,300
I found this on an unplanned route…
204
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,590
An unplanned route, you say?!
205
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,350
What do we do now?
We’ve lost our tent and our food…
206
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,010
There’s no point in saying that!
207
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,260
What?! It’s because you put your foot
on my backpack in the first place…
208
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,470
What’re you talking about?!
209
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,590
If my foot hadn’t gotten caught,
we would’ve blown away.
210
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,390
Now, now…
Stop fighting, believe it.
211
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,850
Why didn’t you close the zipper, Udon?!
212
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,600
Sorry…
213
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,100
Now, now…
Don’t say that, Konohamaru!
214
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,350
When you get right down to it,
215
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,390
it’s your fault for entering a strange route,
Brother Naruto!
216
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,760
Right, right!
217
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,680
What?
218
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,970
We got behind because
219
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,550
you got caught in a trap
and were lost forever!
220
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,760
Hey, what did you say?!
221
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
You can’t justify yourself, can you?!
222
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,590
We could’ve gotten through faster
if you guys hadn’t gotten in the way!
223
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,800
It’s because our leader’s
not dependable!
224
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,470
What?!
225
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,550
Heh! How silly!
226
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,590
– What did you say?!
– What did you say?!
227
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,590
What?!
228
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,470
Ohh… I’m hungry…
Temporary ceasefire.
229
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
This is the spot.
230
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,590
That Naruto…
231
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,510
After all I told him about
following instructions!
232
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,720
Taking the direction of the wind
under consideration,
233
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,890
they’re above here, I guess…
234
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,590
Okay, let’s go, Shikamaru.
235
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,260
Right.
236
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,850
What’s this?!
237
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,010
It’s all stuff we need hot water for…
238
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,050
About the only thing we can eat
is the baumkuchen cake…
239
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,680
I’m hungry…
240
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,890
You’re asking too much!
241
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,550
This is survival,
242
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,470
so it’s common sense to have things ready
that can be eaten right away!
243
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,890
Right, right!
244
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,510
I won’t share if you’re going to complain!
245
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,010
I’m taking the big one.
246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,220
The biggest one…is mine!
247
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,800
The big one… The big one…
248
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,590
Okay, eat up!
249
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,640
What…? But…
250
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,970
It’s divided in three?
251
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,590
You’re not having any here,
Brother Naruto?
252
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,140
Back in the day,
253
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,100
I also went without food once
when I screwed up during training.
254
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,600
We couldn’t all pull together
and Kakashi Sensei got mad at us…
255
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,220
Cripes! Who cares about
three working as one?!
256
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,050
It's called teamwork.
257
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,590
I figured it out at that time.
258
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,590
The important thing for
a Ninja isn’t rules or codes,
259
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,100
but teamwork acting for
the sake of comrades…
260
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,430
Here.
261
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,300
Sakura…
262
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,760
Brother Naruto…
263
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,550
Well as for me,
I don’t like sweets, so!
264
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,590
– Oh… 					– Oh…
265
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,930
You’re one to talk
having bought it yourself!
266
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,930
Your stomach growled.
267
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,300
You have some too, Brother Naruto!
268
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,220
It’s pretty slippery.
You okay, Shikamaru?
269
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,930
Yeah…
270
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,930
Damn it… How could that Naruto
take such a dangerous route?!
271
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,510
Jeez… He’s always causing
some kind of trouble.
272
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,890
What a pain he is…
273
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,350
It seems they were here
until just a little while ago…
274
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,100
He really does cause…trouble.
275
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,850
The finish line is right
before our eyes!
276
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,720
That method of climbing isn’t fair,
I tell you!
277
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,010
Right! I knew we shouldn’t have
shared the food!
278
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
What is it, Udon?
279
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,800
What’re you doing?
We’ll leave you behind!
280
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,260
Something’s…coming…
281
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,590
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
282
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,800
R-Run while you can!
283
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,180
G-Got it!
284
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,930
H-Hurry it up…
285
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,800
Brother Naruto!
286
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,590
– Brother Naruto!
– Brother Naruto!
287
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,260
Brother! Brother Naruto!
Hang in there!
288
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,600
What should we do, Konohamaru?!
289
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,510
We’ll go help him…
290
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,220
But…it looks like
it'll crumble again!
291
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,640
Brother Naruto!
Let’s go, Udon, Moegi!
292
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,430
Are you awake, Brother Naruto?!
293
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,550
That was close. So I made it into
a space between the rocks, huh…?
294
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,300
We’re coming to help!
295
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,970
Idiot! Run, quick!
296
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,760
Konohamaru…
297
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,260
We can’t do it…
Let’s call for help--
298
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,180
Brother said it before!
299
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,590
The important thing for
a Ninja is teamwork!
300
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,300
Konohamaru, you…
301
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,300
No! If I move even a little,
the support rock will give way
302
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,260
and you guys will end up
getting entangled in this!
303
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,140
Brother Naruto! Have you forgotten
what you yourself said?
304
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,760
You can do anything…
305
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,640
…if you get serious!
306
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,010
You guys…
307
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,350
Konohamaru Gang!
Help Brother Naruto!
308
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,590
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
309
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,470
Be careful!
310
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,590
Easy does it!
311
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,550
Yeah.
312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,100
But hurry.
313
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,100
It moved…Time it right and
toss it away in one shot.
314
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,100
Got it!
315
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,510
One, two…!
316
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,390
Yes!
317
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,680
It’s a big success!
318
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,760
We did it, we did it!
319
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,550
That was a close one…
320
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,680
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!
321
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,890
You guys okay?
322
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,680
Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru!
323
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,590
Naruto! Above you!
324
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,600
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
325
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,430
Run towards Shikamaru!
326
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,050
– Brother Naruto!
– Brother Naruto!
327
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,300
Naruto!
328
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,680
Rasengan!
329
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,590
Naruto…
330
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,590
Man, making us get all nervous…
331
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,050
Excellent, Brother Naruto…
332
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,720
Thank goodness!
333
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,590
Yeah!
334
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,930
So, what’s the meaning of this?
335
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,890
So you see…
336
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,180
It was all Brother Naruto’s orders!
337
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,470
We were opposed,
338
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,590
but he forced us to move ahead
saying the only way to finish first
339
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,600
was to take a dangerous shortcut!
340
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,390
I said many times we shouldn’t
because it’s dangerous!
341
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,590
But…
342
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,430
– Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
– Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
343
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,350
What…? What?
344
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,510
It seems that’s about the size of it…
You’re prepared, right, Naruto?
345
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,680
Say…
346
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,010
Since when did your teamwork
get so good?
347
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,140
Naruto!
348
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,720
I’ve had it with lectures!
349
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,720
Hey, wait! Naruto!
350
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,760
Wait!
351
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:41,590
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
352
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:53,180
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
353
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:04,590
What dreams did you chase to get here?
354
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:16,600
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
355
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:28,140
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
356
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:39,590
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
357
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,510
I’ll be close to you
358
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,590
Across the verdant wild
came the slender giant!
359
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,510
Equipped with two wakizashi,
a wandering bounty hunter!
360
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,470
The target is Gosunkugi,
the villainous thief!
361
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,890
A fierce battle of hunt and be hunted!
Then comes the voice to halt the action!
362
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,680
Hey, hey, hey!
That bastard thief is mine!
363
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,050
Enter Naruto Uzumaki!
364
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,680
Next time:
"The Bounty Hunter from the Wilderness"
//%
1
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,980
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,190
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,350
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:53,060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,940
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,980
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,440
I’ll let you out of here.
13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,600
And I’ll grant you one wish, too.
14
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,690
You don’t have to worry.
15
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,890
Your strong will is going to remain
as Residual Aura inside me.
16
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,690
It’s not like you’ll lose everything.
17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,890
Now then, your flesh is mine.
18
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,940
With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body
has once again
19
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,650
become unable to reanimate
for several years.
20
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,890
However there’s a next time…
21
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,890
I-Indeed. My body no longer has value
as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
22
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,480
It will now be difficult for me
who has lost everything…
23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,020
to find my own calling.
24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,940
I’ve finally understood that.
25
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,230
Even if it’s not me…
26
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,730
I’ll bring in the new “vessel,”
even if it costs me my life.
27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,020
That’s my repayment to
Lord Orochimaru.
28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,850
That’s the only redemption for me…
who was worthless.
29
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,890
Miscalculation: A New Enemy Appears!
30
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,060
They’re fast.
31
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,890
Akamaru.
32
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Come quick after you’ve set the bombs!
33
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh no!
34
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,350
All right.
35
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,350
Great.
36
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,350
Akamaru, well done.
37
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,940
Messing with me.
38
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,690
Akamaru.
39
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,230
Don’t you “arf” me, you mutt!
40
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,560
I’ll waste you.
41
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,600
Hold on.
42
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,440
You!
43
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,020
Kiba! Akamaru!
44
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,890
Damn it.
45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,100
What’s happening?
46
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,890
You punks!
47
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,350
Where are Kiba and Akamaru?!
48
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,150
Another one’s come.
49
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,400
We have no choice.
50
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,890
I’ll take care of this, so you take
the coffin and go on ahead.
51
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,940
Shikamaru…
52
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,890
Get going already.
53
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,650
Wh-Why are you…?
54
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,890
I’m sorry, Naruto.
lt’s my miscalculation.
55
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,310
Kimimaro.
56
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,350
You were taking too long, Tayuya.
57
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,020
And what happened to
the other three?
58
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,890
Being none other than those
of the former “Sound Ninja Five.”
59
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,400
Why are you…?
60
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,890
Your body… Your body’s no longer…
61
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,810
I’m not moving with the flesh anymore.
lt’s mental power.
62
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,850
Man, you cheater of death…
63
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,810
I understand a little now,
that feeling…
64
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,020
of being information that has escaped
from the prison of the flesh.
65
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,730
The feeling of experiencing
a taste of Lord Orochimaru’s dream.
66
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,520
Orochimaru…!
67
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,060
This vessel…is an important vessel
for the dream…
68
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,440
The flesh that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.
69
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,890
But you guys were a bit too late.
70
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,100
Some dangerous guy
has appeared again.
71
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,230
That air about him is
nothing ordinary.
72
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,520
Anyway, we need
to sort out the situation.
73
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,270
If we were to carelessly
plunge in…
74
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,890
You jerk.
What’re you babbling nonsense?
75
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,730
Naruto!
76
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,310
Give back Sasuke!
77
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,690
Hey, wait!
78
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,190
Tayuya.
79
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,890
The reason why I won’t kill you now
80
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,600
is because you have a mission
you have to complete.
81
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,310
And my mission is to deliver
that to Lord Orochimaru.
82
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,890
Isn’t it too late now?
83
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,020
Humph. I told you.
84
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
That’s the body that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.
85
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,890
The next vessel, huh?
86
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,270
That’s right…
87
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,400
And this is the only thing that
I can do at present.
88
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,600
I leave those two pieces
of garbage to you.
89
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,940
Sasuke…
90
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,190
That punk!
91
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,520
Calm down, Naruto.
92
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,980
How can I calm down?
93
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,270
At this rate,
Sasuke will get far away again.
94
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,850
Naruto’s right.
95
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,890
This is a mission to bring Sasuke back
to the Leaf Village.
96
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,890
We must choose what would be
the most rational means
97
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,440
to execute the mission.
98
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,480
Damned punks.
99
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,020
I’ll finish this in a flash.
100
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,150
Naruto, listen up.
101
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,400
Please move according to the plan
that I’m going to tell you.
102
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,400
He’s a classic close-range
combat-type fool
103
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,810
with Shadow Clone Jutsu
as his only saving grace.
104
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,440
And he’s a middle-range
combat type
105
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,890
who binds his enemies with
a Jutsu using shadows…
106
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,560
and a sharp squad leader, huh?
107
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,600
Got it?
108
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,350
Yeah.
109
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,810
Come on already, you punks.
110
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,400
It’s two versus one.
We’ve got the upper hand.
111
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,890
It’s an opponent we can beat
if we team up.
112
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,100
Let’s go, Naruto.
113
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,190
All right.
114
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,060
With garbage like you jerks,
115
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,230
it doesn’t matter how many
of you are there.
116
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,940
Don’t underestimate our teamwork.
117
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,190
Let’s go!
118
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,890
Bring it.
119
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,400
Now... Naruto.
120
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,020
I’ll blow you away.
121
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,890
Gotcha. The strategy is a success.
122
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,940
Farewell.
123
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,730
Blast.
124
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,060
You tricked me.
125
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,600
Teamwork, my foot. You little punks…
126
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,890
Blast.
127
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,270
You wouldn’t fall for the same trick
over and over, huh..?
128
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,810
Small fry… You’ve got nerve.
129
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,890
Well, I guess I’ll settle for just
having been able to let him get away.
130
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,020
Remember this.
131
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,890
It’s not just Jutsu that are weapons.
132
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,890
I’m counting on you, Shikamaru.
133
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,150
Hang in there, Sasuke.
134
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,890
But that kid,
135
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,060
how wonderful it is that
he can move with that body, eh?
136
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,560
Kabuto, I don’t know what kind
of order you gave him,
137
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,350
but it’s a bit harsh.
138
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,230
Not at all.
lt wasn’t an order.
139
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,650
I don’t like to force things.
140
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,810
He acted on his own.
141
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,890
For you whom he reveres.
142
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,890
Kabuto…You’ve really got
a hateful personality, don’t you?
143
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,770
Lord Orochimaru.
144
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,890
To you,
Kimimaro was a perfect existence…
145
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,400
His thoughts were steeped in darkness
in the same way as yours.
146
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,520
And he sanctified you.
147
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,810
And he fanatically admired
and revered you.
148
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,890
Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clan
with the strongest and perfect bodies
149
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:53,020
being the legitimate bloodline
of their Kekkai Genkai…
150
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,890
until a short time ago.
151
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,890
Yes…
152
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,060
When I think about having lost him,
I still get a chill down my spine.
153
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,690
I think about it even now…
154
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:12,770
The man I truly wished for…
The body I wanted the most…Kimimaro.
155
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,400
And if only he hadn’t been stricken
with disease,
156
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,020
the assassination of the Hokage
would’ve gone smoother.
157
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,940
Seal!
158
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,890
My arms….
159
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,020
Now…you can no longer use
either of your arms…
160
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,150
And since you can't use your arms,
161
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,310
you can't weave Sign…
162
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,560
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
163
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,400
Your ambition of crushing
the Hidden Leaf…dies right here!
164
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,060
Orochimaru, you fool…
165
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,890
It's unfortunate that we can't leave
together but, my disciple…
166
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,890
Let's meet in the other world
one day…
167
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,770
Sasuke…
Sasuke’s not here yet?
168
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,650
We wouldn’t have needed to go
through such an experience.
169
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,400
In the world, very often things don’t go
as we want them to.
170
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,890
It’s only a matter of time,
Lord Orochimaru.
171
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,600
When Tayuya…comes back,
I’ll kill her.
172
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,480
Hold it.
173
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,690
Hey…!
174
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,900
Now then, how shall I defeat you?
175
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,890
You…
176
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,060
Those eyes…
177
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,270
It seems he possesses
a peculiar Chakra.
178
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,730
What does Orochimaru want to do…?
Why’s he after Sasuke?
179
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,100
Lord Orochimaru has already
obtained Immortality Jutsu…
180
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:30,770
A long time is necessary to get every Jutsu
and obtain everything in the world.
181
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,440
What does that have to do
with Sasuke?!
182
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,850
“Immortal” doesn’t mean that
the flesh is being maintained as is…
183
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,890
Before his body decays,
184
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,890
a strong and new flesh will be made
into a vessel for his soul.
185
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,270
That’s…
186
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,890
Are you saying that’s Sasuke?!
187
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,310
Yes… That’s right.
188
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,350
I won’t let such a thing happen!
189
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,350
Idiot… What will come of sending
one shrimp punk in pursuit?
190
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,310
And looking at things
in terms of time,
191
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,690
up until now you probably sacrificed
one member each time
192
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,690
in order for the group
to move forward.
193
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,600
Is that guy called Sasuke
that important?
194
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,890
How many of your men do you intend
to sacrifice for the sake of just one person?
195
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,520
You incompetent punk.
196
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,440
Heh… Indeed…
197
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,890
For me, this is my first mission
as a platoon leader.
198
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,520
It’s very disquieting having
comrades gradually whittled down,
199
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,890
and I didn’t know if my own judgments
were correct or not.
200
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,890
As a squad leader with
the lives of the party in my hands…
201
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,770
respecting the lives in
the four-member party,
202
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,400
rather than the life of one person
taken by the enemy…
203
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,270
and deciding to abort a mission
that’s too dangerous, would be by the book.
204
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,230
Then, why didn’t you do that?
205
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,270
The world doesn’t go
by the book very often…
206
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,980
Since not one person in my squad
would do something like
207
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:33,890
abandon a captured comrade and give up
fighting for the sake of their own safety.
208
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,150
Me included.
209
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,150
Being the cloud-loving loafer myself,
210
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,890
I am not cut out to be a squad leader
who gives orders to comrades.
211
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:56,650
The only thing I can do for them...
is to have faith in them.
212
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,230
Listen. I’m not thinking anything
like they were sacrifices.
213
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,310
I’m not thinking anything
like they’ve died.
214
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,600
Don’t mock my comrades.
215
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,890
I got you.
216
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,190
Summoning Jutsu!
217
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,020
This doesn’t…look so good.
218
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,890
I’ll play a melody of death for you.
219
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,890
Don’t you mock us,
you damned punk.
220
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,020
I won’t let you take Sasuke,
no matter what.
221
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,270
Interesting.
222
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,560
For the first time, I spoke to you
223
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,690
And you smiled
224
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,100
For the first time, I was able to speak
225
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,890
In my own words
226
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,650
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
227
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,060
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
228
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,890
My clumsy attempts with words
229
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,560
You listened without turning away
230
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,850
No wonder I get carried away by you
231
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:10,890
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
232
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,940
I feel so sad
233
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,900
But…
234
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,480
For the first time, I spoke to you
235
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,520
And you smiled
236
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,190
For the first time, I was able to speak
237
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,270
In my own words
238
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,890
For the first time, I spoke to you
239
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,900
And you smiled
240
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,560
For the first time, I was able to speak
241
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,520
In my own words
242
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,060
For the first time, I spoke to you
243
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,270
Damn it! What'll I do?!
244
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,480
He's trouble enough yet,
245
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,890
but his Chakra has increased
several ten-fold!
246
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,480
It's no good. I can't use it here yet.
247
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,150
But if I stay like this, we'll…
248
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,810
I get it, Akamaru.
249
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,560
It's like you said.
250
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,480
I have no choice but to use it!
251
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,890
Next time: "Roar and Howl!
The Ultimate Tag-Team!"
//%
1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,010
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,470
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,680
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,180
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,100
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,430
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,010
The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan
21
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,050
No matter what darkness
might lie ahead,
22
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,970
I will rush into it headfirst!
23
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,100
No matter what happens,
24
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,430
I will get my hands
on that power!
25
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,590
It’s getting late…
26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,220
What was that?
27
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,590
I thought I sensed
someone there just now…
28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,050
The lights…
29
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,970
It isn’t even close
to bedtime yet…
30
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,800
This is…!
31
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,350
Wh-What is this…?!
32
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,590
What the hell is this?!
33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,590
Uncle… Aunt…
34
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,350
Father… Mother…
35
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,590
Father? Mother?
36
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,600
There’s somebody in there!
37
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,590
Move!
38
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,590
Move!
39
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,010
Move!
40
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,140
Father! Mother!
41
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,140
Big Brother!
42
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,890
Big Brother!
Father and Mother are…!
43
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,510
Why? For what reason?!
44
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,890
Who the hell would do
something like this…?!
45
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,140
Big Brother…what are…?
46
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,590
What are you doing, Big Brother?!
47
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,300
You pathetic younger brother…
48
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,510
Mangekyo Sharingan!
49
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,590
Stop! Big Brother!
50
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,590
Don’t make me see
this kind of thing!
51
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,350
Why…?!
52
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,010
Big Brother, why did you…?!
53
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,550
Why…
54
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,510
Big Brother… Why did you…?
55
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,220
In order to measure my vessel…
56
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
To measure your vessel?
57
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,260
Is that all?
58
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,350
Only for that reason…
you killed everybody…?
59
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,590
That is what is important.
60
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,930
What the hell is that?
61
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,590
You gotta be kidding!
62
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,100
I’m scared…
63
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,010
I’m scared!
64
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,300
Don’t kill me…!
65
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,550
I don’t believe it!
66
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,760
This is too unlike you, Big Brother.
I mean…
67
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,430
The reason I acted as the big brother
you desired was…
68
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,100
because I wanted to
measure your vessel.
69
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,350
You have the potential
to become my opponent
70
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,390
in order for me to measure
my vessel.
71
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,680
You hated me…
72
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,600
and you continued to have
the desire to surpass me.
73
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,930
That’s exactly why
I will allow you to live…
74
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,640
for my own benefit.
75
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,890
You are someone who could be able to use
Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.
76
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,590
However, on one condition…
77
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,470
That you must kill
your closest friend…
78
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,760
Y-You’ve gotta be kidding…
79
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,590
Just like I did…
80
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,590
Regarding Shisui Uchiha
who committed suicide last night
81
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,300
by throwing himself into
the Nakano River…
82
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,100
The other one that did not show up
to the meeting is Shisui…
83
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,590
If I remember correctly…
84
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,300
you adored him like
he was your real older brother…
85
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,140
That was…your doing…?
86
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,430
Big Brother, you…killed Shisui?!
87
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,100
That’s right…and because of
that I obtained these eyes.
88
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,760
The main hall of Nakano Shrine…
89
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,550
Underneath the seventh tatami mat
on the far right
90
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,970
is the secret gathering place
of the Clan.
91
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,430
There you will find recorded
the secret of…
92
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:58,220
the raison d'être of
the Uchiha Clan’s Visual Jutsu.
93
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,850
The secret of the raison d'être…?
94
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,760
If you attain these eyes,
95
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
you will become the third person
including myself
96
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,970
to utilize
the Mangekyo Sharingan.
97
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,510
If that happens…
98
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,760
then there will have been meaning
in my allowing you to live.
99
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,590
However…at present…
100
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,010
You are not worth killing.
101
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,890
My pathetic younger brother…
102
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,760
If you want to kill me,
then begrudge me!
103
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,350
Hate me!
104
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,010
And live in an ugly manner…
105
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,590
Run away…run away…
and cling to life…
106
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,100
And one day, when you have
the same eyes as I do…
107
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,590
come and stand before me!
108
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,350
A dream…?
109
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes…that’s right.
110
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,140
The only one who survived…
is that boy.
111
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,600
Didn't he have
an older brother?
112
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,590
Yes, but he’s gone missing…
113
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,430
It can’t be true…
That elite Uchiha Clan…
114
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Hi, Sasuke! What did you
come to buy today?
115
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,590
Sasuke, are you on your way to school?
116
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,680
Yeah.
117
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,430
I saw Itachi earlier,
but he’s very admirable, isn’t he?
118
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,760
He’s already become
a top-class Shinobi.
119
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,590
He graduated from the Ninja Academy
at the top of his class at age seven
120
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,590
and attained the rank
of Chunin at age ten, didn’t he?
121
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,800
He was able to use Sharingan
when he was eight!
122
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,760
That’s true, isn’t it?
123
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,220
That boy is truly the pride
of the Uchiha Clan.
124
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,850
Welcome home…Sasuke!
125
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,050
Sasuke…!
126
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,680
Wait a second…
127
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,720
What is it?
128
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,590
Mother?!
129
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,590
Then why only Big Brother!
130
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,010
Your brother's your brother.
And you are you.
131
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,550
Father cares deeply
about both of you.
132
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,720
The main hall of Nakano Shrine…
133
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,720
Located underneath
the seventh tatami mat on the far right
134
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,590
is our clan’s secret gathering place…
135
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,100
I see… So that’s what it is…
136
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,470
Ninja Academy
137
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,930
Hey, Shikamaru…
138
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,050
Wanna go to the candy shop
after school?
139
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,590
Huh… No way.
140
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,140
You can do that ‘cuz
your mother’s nice,
141
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,590
but if my mother found out that I bought
myself a snack before going home,
142
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,260
I’d be in big trouble.
143
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,140
Did you hear the news…
144
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,300
that entire Uchiha Clan
was apparently murdered?
145
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,430
Yeah, my dad told me.
146
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,970
Apparently he’s the only one
who survived…
147
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,430
That’s my boy.
148
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,050
With me, you’re all
your father talks about…
149
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,100
I wonder…what kind of things
Father was saying to Mother…
150
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,510
If you want to kill me…
151
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,600
Begrudge me! Hate me!
152
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,220
If it’s for the purpose of killing you,
153
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,050
I will rush headfirst into whatever
darkness which may lie ahead!
154
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,390
I will obtain that power no matter what!
155
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,930
From this point onwards,
I am an avenger!
156
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,510
Sasuke is now
in depths of darkness…
157
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,390
If you stop in a place like this…
158
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,760
you won’t be able to catch up
with Sasuke.
159
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,430
Neji, it’s just like you said.
160
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,550
That guy looks like he’s in
the depths of darkness right now…
161
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,350
He really hit me with
his full strength! Damn it!
162
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,010
Don’t you consider me…
your comrade any longer?!
163
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,590
Don’t all those things we did together
in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!
164
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,050
No.
165
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,590
I will get my hands on
that power no matter what.
166
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,850
It wasn’t meaningless…
167
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,390
To me, you became my…
closest friend.
168
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,470
We've become…friends?
169
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,800
Then…why?!
170
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,640
All the more reason why…
171
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,720
All the more reason why…
172
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,300
there’s meaning in taking
you down.
173
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,050
I don’t fully understand but…
174
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,590
I understood that you want to
fight me with your everything!
175
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,590
Sasuke…!
176
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,590
When I recalled the parts one by one,
177
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:34,850
I felt as though
I had understood everything
178
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:45,550
Faded words which I kept so close to me
179
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:55,260
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
180
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:02,010
and this distant yearning for you
181
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:11,390
I live, simply repeating this cycle
182
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:23,010
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
183
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:33,550
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
184
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,220
I’ll keep these thoughts…
185
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,550
Are you trying to take me
down for real?
186
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,300
I don’t know any longer
187
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,140
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not!
188
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,930
Could it be that it was only I
who thought we were friends?
189
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,590
If that’s the case,
I’m just a really lame guy…
190
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,590
Aren’t I? Sasuke?
191
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,220
Next episode: “For a Friend”
//%
1
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,990
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,750
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,290
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,990
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,540
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:46,410
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:55,870
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:06,660
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:16,000
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,160
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,330
Too Late for Help
12
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,290
You guys did good work.
Komei has confessed.
13
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,990
It seems he plotted
the Cursed Warrior…
14
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,580
to mislead the public and
to take the feudal lord position.
15
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,160
Is that what Komei said?
16
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,500
Yes. It turned out to be
such a trifle.
17
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,990
The Cursed Warrior vanishing
18
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,990
was a soldier disguising himself
as the Warrior
19
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,990
using a strong nitrohydrochloric acid
to melt his own flesh.
20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,990
It's empty again.
21
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,990
With this, the Cursed Warrior
incident is resolved.
22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,000
Now the Land of Birds
should return
23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,790
to the beautiful and
quiet land it used to be.
24
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,620
Just a minute!
25
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,620
But the Cursed Warrior still isn’t…!
26
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,620
Don’t bother.
27
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,910
But…!
28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,660
Now you are relieved
of your duty.
29
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,830
Have a safe journey back
to your village…
30
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,370
Why?!
31
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,120
You said the one we saw first
32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,700
and the one last night
were different, right?
33
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,910
Perhaps there were multiple people
disguised as the Cursed Warrior,
34
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,990
not just one alone.
35
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,330
If there was a person
inside disguised,
36
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,830
then how do you explain
the Warrior flying?!
37
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,040
As long as our mission has
been ordered complete,
38
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,040
there’s no reason to continue
the mission in this land now.
39
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,660
Besides, Komei confessed
to the crime, right?
40
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,500
But, it’s suspicious!
41
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,830
I can’t go along with it
if I don’t get the whole story!
42
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,040
This land has
its own circumstances.
43
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,080
Getting too involved
will cause trouble.
44
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,990
Humph!
45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,000
Then I’ll just have to do it
my way.
46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
Hold it.
47
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,990
I’m the leader of this team.
48
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,990
So what?!
49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,990
You look into the movements
of the Cursed Warrior once more.
50
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,950
Tenten and I will reinvestigate
this incident from a different angle.
51
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,700
What? But the mission’s over…
52
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,620
You have a point
with what you said.
53
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,990
Everything is moving along
too swimmingly.
54
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,750
All right! Leave it to me.
55
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,160
Huh?
56
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,990
Where are you going, Naruto?
57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,410
Isn’t it obvious?
To investigate the Cursed Warrior!
58
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,200
What?
59
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,120
Oh, Chishima.
60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,790
Um, Naruto just now…
61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,540
It’s nothing, it’s nothing.
62
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,290
Did you have business
with us?
63
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,990
Oh, yes.
64
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,160
You have all been so helpful
to me the whole time…
65
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,750
I feel so bad about
that low payment…
66
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,620
Additional money?
67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,700
We couldn’t…
68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,160
No, it’s the specialty of
the Land of Birds,
69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,950
chicken wing buns filled
with bean jam.
70
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,410
Yakitori Tsurucho
71
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,910
Thanks!
72
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,990
Sure enough,
this area’s fishy, believe it.
73
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,990
It’s kind of time-consuming
searching alone…
74
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,870
Summoning Jutsu!
75
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,410
Ahh, long time no see.
Are you giving me a snack?
76
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,660
Why is it you guys?!
77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,250
Dad’s busy with stuff, so.
78
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,450
No, I can’t have Boss Gama
appearing, either…
79
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,540
Well, I guess it can’t be helped.
80
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,250
You guys have a better sense
of smell than humans, right?
81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,990
You’re calling us puppies?!
82
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,990
Geez! Toad authority
has sure hit rock bottom!
83
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,870
Gamatatsu, we’re leaving!
84
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,950
Gamatatsu?
85
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,040
Hey, Gamatatsu!
86
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,950
A frog that pounces on
a willow leaf?
87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,990
What’re you doing, you idiot?!
88
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,040
Big Brother Gamakichi…
89
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,250
I wonder what…this is?
90
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,580
Whoa, it’s dark.
lt’s night.
91
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,040
Good night.
92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,410
Good morning.
93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,040
What’s this?
94
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,990
It’s a kite painted black.
95
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,370
A kite?
96
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,000
Look up there!
97
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,410
That’s a totally huge kite,
believe it.
98
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,620
I wonder if there was
a big kite-flying festival or something.
99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,080
It’s rather plain for
a festival kite…
100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,410
What?! What does that mean?
101
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,990
Oh no!
102
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,580
Hey! Where are you going?!
103
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,700
I’m back.
104
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,990
I get it… If one were to fly that
in the cover of a dark night…
105
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,370
A Cursed Warrior hanging
onto the black kite
106
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,080
would look like he was flying…
107
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,290
With this, the mystery of
the flying warrior is solved, believe it!
108
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,580
Next…
109
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,370
Someone was here
on that night…
110
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,410
What is it?
111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,580
The Cursed Warrior came out
from here.
112
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,700
It just looks like an old temple
that isn’t used much at all.
113
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,990
You’re right.
114
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,660
Let’s go, Gamatatsu!
115
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,990
But Big Brother Gamakichi,
it’s nice and cool here.
116
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,700
What’re you talking about?!
ln such a hot and humid temple…
117
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,540
Indeed, that’s a nice damp wind.
118
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,410
See? Isn’t it comfortable?
119
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,950
Draft from down below here…?
120
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,910
What’s this?
121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,990
Wow! I wonder if
a giant worm made this.
122
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,700
Or a mole?
123
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,830
All right, let’s check it out.
124
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,910
I wonder how we should greet
a mole if we were to meet one.
125
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,990
Like I care!
126
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,450
So Naruto is still investigating
the Cursed Warrior, huh?
127
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,830
I should probably inform Lord Moso.
128
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,370
There was some trouble caused,
129
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,990
but we have at last found
a safe refuge.
130
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,250
After him!
131
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,540
Big Brother, where are we?
132
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,750
Huh?! This place is…
133
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,990
This is the residence of
the feudal lord, isn’t it?
134
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,700
Really? Residence of
the feudal lord?
135
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,040
No wonder
it’s an impressive building.
136
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,990
It was connected to this place?
137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,990
What was that sound?
138
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,990
Oh! What a nice view.
139
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,330
Hey! What're  you doing?!
140
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,950
Shh! Keep quiet!
We’ll be discovered.
141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,080
Big Brother Gamakichi!
142
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,160
Uh, oh!
143
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,750
You blockhead!
144
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,990
Uh, umm…
Good work with your duties!
145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,990
As for me,
I’m not anyone suspicious!
146
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,990
I was asked by
the Superintendent Moso and
147
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,410
I’m investigating the incident…
148
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,990
It’ll make sense if
I tell you about it!
149
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,790
Oww!
150
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,250
Lord Sagi! We have captured
a suspicious man.
151
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,990
What shall we do with him?
152
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,160
What…? Oh!
153
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,990
Oh. Sagi, bro! Hey!
We met at the lake, didn’t we?
154
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,990
Explain to them about me!
155
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,200
I know no such person.
156
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,990
What?!
157
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,450
He’s not worth sending
to the magistrate’s office.
158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,950
Lock him in the dungeon.
159
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,450
Yes, my lord!
160
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,120
Hey, that’s harsh! Come on, Sagi!
161
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,580
Hey! Wait a minute!
Come on, hey!
162
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,660
Come on.
This is a misunderstanding!
163
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,330
I was just going after
the Cursed Warrior!
164
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,080
Umm, everything will make sense
if you just ask Mr. Moso.
165
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,990
You okay?
166
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,000
Yo!
167
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,290
I can’t be fighting the soldiers
of my employer’s land.
168
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,160
Geez. You had to go and
get caught in that trap!
169
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,120
Well, it’s cool. I can get out
of a place like this right away
170
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,700
if I just use both my hands.
171
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,330
Hey, untie this.
172
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,990
Right. Just a second.
173
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,990
Wha--?!
174
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,620
Th-The Cursed Warrior…?!
175
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,540
Damn it!
176
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,990
If I could just use both hands,
this guy would be…!
177
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,830
Big Brother,
are we going to let things be?
178
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,990
If things go wrong,
we’d be sliced in two.
179
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,980
I wouldn’t want that.
180
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,270
Just a little more…
181
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,890
Just a little more…!
182
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Sagi?!
183
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,600
What’s going on here?
184
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,520
You’re the other Cursed Warrior?
185
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,520
But, why?
186
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,060
They say people become disembodied
spirits and avenge themselves…
187
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,890
But that’s a lie!
188
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,850
This watch has been handed down
from generation to generation
189
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,890
in the feudal lord family.
190
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,150
It was supposed to be passed
from father to son…
191
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,850
But now along with that death,
the watch has stopped ticking away.
192
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,890
It must have been very sad…
193
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,900
I am shamelessly living on
only for the sake of revenge!
194
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,890
I can go to hell if
I can just complete my revenge!
195
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,190
That’s no good!
196
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
There is no way you could understand
197
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
how someone who has had everything
taken away from them feels!
198
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,150
Like I know about stuff like that!
199
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,020
But I, at least, know that living for
the sake of revenge is wrong!
200
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,150
You’re a feudal lord, aren’t you?
201
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,650
Is revenge the job
of a feudal lord?
202
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,890
You know that’s not it.
203
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,690
The true culprit Komei
has been arrested.
204
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,060
You should just leave
the rest to Moso. Okay?
205
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,890
It is no concern of yours…
206
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,560
I must not let you live
207
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,400
now that you have
learned everything!
208
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,560
As the thief who snuck into
the residence of the feudal lord…
209
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,770
your fate is a death sentence!
210
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,890
No way…!
211
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,560
This is creepy…
212
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,890
This is the tomb of the successive
generations of feudal lords, right?
213
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,890
Yeah.
214
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,890
That’s the tomb of the Lord Owashi…
215
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,350
Byakugan!
216
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,690
What’s this?
217
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,890
What is it, Neji?
What are you seeing?!
218
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,890
There’s something poisonous
in Owashi’s body.
219
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,890
Was he assassinated…?!
220
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,400
We’re surrounded.
221
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,890
An announcement to
the Ninja from the Leaf Village.
222
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,190
A message has just
now been delivered
223
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,190
from the residence of
the feudal lord!
224
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,350
Your comrade has been arrested
for infiltrating…
225
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,600
the residence of the feudal lord…
226
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,560
and his death sentence
has been determined!
227
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,940
Leave the Land of Birds at once!
228
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,730
If you don’t, you will be executed here
for the same crime.
229
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,730
It doesn’t matter!
Draw your bows!
230
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,400
Neji, what should we do?
231
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,890
Let’s go to the residence
of the feudal lord.
232
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,520
We’re going to save Naruto!
233
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,600
You’re…
234
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,810
Kakashi Sensei!
Naruto’s in trouble!
235
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,480
We have to go to the residence
of the feudal lord immediately
236
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,690
and save him…
237
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,890
We can’t do that.
238
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,600
Your mission is over.
239
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,730
But!
240
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,810
Don’t do anything other
than the mission.
241
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:41,770
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
242
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:53,230
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
243
00:21:53,890 --> 00:22:04,690
What dreams did you chase to get here?
244
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:16,890
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
245
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:28,190
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
246
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:39,850
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
247
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,560
I’ll be close to you
248
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,440
Are we really going back
to the village like this?
249
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,310
I told you. Our mission in
the Land of Birds is finished now.
250
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,770
But then, what’ll happen
to Naruto?
251
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,890
We can’t interfere with
this land’s internal affairs.
252
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,890
No way…
253
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,890
Sorry. The responsibility rests
on me, the leader.
254
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,810
Let it go… Sacrifice is
a part of Shinobi missions.
255
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,890
Next time: “The Death of Naruto.”
//%
1
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,590
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,430
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,970
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,590
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,220
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:46,100
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:55,550
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:06,350
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:15,680
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,850
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,430
Where’s Naruto?
12
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,640
It’s no good.
I can’t find him.
13
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,180
I see…
14
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,640
He’s not close by anymore.
15
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,050
Either he drifted away…
16
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,430
or he has escaped.
17
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,140
At any rate, with this fog…
18
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,680
There’s no reason to
remain here any longer.
19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,590
Let’s make it to a shore nearby
and start again.
20
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,300
Understood.
21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,600
The Closed Door
22
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,260
It’s been a while, Lord Orochimaru.
23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,390
It truly has.
24
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,680
To think I’d stop by on
a whim to find you still here.
25
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,720
And it’s for that reason that
I am able to meet with you again.
26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,050
So does the fact that
you’re here mean
27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,850
you're still continuing that research?
28
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,850
Yes.
29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,590
And I think someday it will be
of help to you, Lord Orochimaru…
30
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,760
I wonder if that’s true.
31
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,850
And all this is due to my loyalty.
32
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,590
Do whatever you like…
33
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,260
Thank you.
34
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,590
By the way…
35
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,010
is he the one you were
talking of earlier?
36
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,890
Yes, he’s Itachi Uchiha’s
younger brother.
37
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,930
Oh really…
38
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,590
Yes, my…
39
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,260
Please don’t…
40
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,760
say anything unnecessary!
41
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,640
It appears that Naruto
is no longer close by.
42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,970
Hey…
43
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,590
Naruto, surely he’s safe, isn’t he…?
44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
He can’t be beaten that easily.
45
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,590
After all, he too is a Leaf Shinobi…
46
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,590
Shiragiku Inn
I’m responsible for guarding
the ships collecting funds.
47
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,140
I’m Hitode.
48
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,430
I know the circumstances,
49
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,220
your colleague has disappeared
and I’m sure that you’re worried…
50
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,590
Have you received
any information since then?
51
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,800
I’m sorry, but there’s been
no information
52
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,600
regarding a victim rescued
from a shipwreck.
53
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,050
I see.
54
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,590
However, I'm troubled.
55
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,390
This is difficult to say,
56
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,140
but the departure of the collection ships
has been pushed forward…
57
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,590
Pushed forward?
58
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,760
Now we’re scheduled to
leave tomorrow morning.
59
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,590
We apologize for
our late notice.
60
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,550
As expected,
a large number of people find
61
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,260
the relationship with
Land of Water very important
62
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
and we had to push
the departure forward.
63
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,600
I understand.
64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
But we’d like to take time here
65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,180
to seek and investigate
our colleague…
66
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,590
Of course.
67
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,680
We’ll meet you directly
at the port tomorrow
68
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,590
for the guard duty.
69
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,300
Thank you for cooperating.
70
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,550
Just one thing.
71
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,720
Yes…
72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,590
As you can see, we are
not a very wealthy country.
73
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,220
Fishermen and we are
both concerned
74
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,180
about the disturbance of
this Demon of the Ocean.
75
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,680
We greatly appreciate for
your help with our country.
76
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,590
I understand.
77
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,470
That’s right, I…
78
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,050
You’ve come to?
79
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,470
Y-Yeah…
80
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,600
Hey, you’re the girl
from yesterday…!
81
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,350
I get it now!
82
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,050
You saved me, thank you!
83
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,850
It just happened…
84
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,640
No, seriously you saved me.
85
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,890
Oh, I’m Naruto Uzumaki.
What’s your name?
86
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,850
Isaribi.
87
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,970
So Isaribi, you’re the girl
who saved my life.
88
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,010
Why did you come to
this remote area?
89
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,260
A mission, of course!
90
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,300
To exterminate the Demon of the Ocean
that has been troubling this country!
91
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,350
It would be best to quit.
92
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,590
You won't get away easily if you get
involved with the Demon of the Ocean.
93
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,350
You don't need to worry.
Anyway, this is a mission.
94
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,300
We were careless yesterday,
95
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,720
but next time we’ll catch that
Demon of the Ocean--!
96
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,680
That’s hot!
97
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,850
So…you feel fine now?
98
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,890
Yep! Thanks to you,
it’s excellent, believe it!
99
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,260
Then, once you’ve eaten that,
get out.
100
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,640
Huh?
101
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,590
What? What?
102
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,890
Wait, Isaribi!
103
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,100
Hey!
104
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,590
Isaribi… Wait…
105
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,890
Huh, wha--?
106
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,590
Monster! Go away!
107
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,100
What’s this?
108
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,850
It’s the work of some brats
from the village.
109
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,100
If I let it bother me,
there’s no end to it.
110
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,590
Oh, Isaribi…
111
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,050
Really, thank you so much.
112
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,640
She’s out, the monster!
113
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,760
What the…?
114
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,850
Get out of here!
115
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,220
You’re bad luck
116
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,350
Take this!
117
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,760
I-Isaribi…
118
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,260
Stop it, brats!
119
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,050
– Disappear!
– Get out of here!
120
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,140
Say something!
121
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Hey, stop! All of you!
122
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,590
You’re taking your pranks
a little too far!
123
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,890
Who are you?!
A friend of this monster?!
124
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,590
Monster?
125
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,930
Everyone’s saying it.
126
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,640
Isaribi was spirited away
127
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,590
and became friends with
the Demon of the Ocean!
128
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,590
Don’t say such irresponsible things!
129
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,600
It’s true!
130
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,140
Ouch!
131
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,050
– Run! 					– Stupid guy!
132
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,510
– Hey! Who you calling stupid?!
– Stop!
133
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,800
What?! But…
134
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,550
It’s okay…
135
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,050
Leave me alone.
136
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,430
I can’t leave you alone!
137
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,430
If they keep doing that…
138
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,390
I’m saying that it’s none
of your business!
139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,800
I’m the girl who was
spirited away.
140
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,050
So it’s natural that people
find me creepy.
141
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,430
But that’s not your fault!
142
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,930
That doesn’t matter.
143
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,930
Humans don’t let those who
are different from them
144
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,640
into their group.
145
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,930
So…
146
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,390
Your colleague was lost at sea…
147
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
We thought that if a boat left port
between the evening and morning
148
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,590
maybe they saw something…
149
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,970
Sorry, but I don’t think
I can help.
150
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,510
Because of
the Demon of the Ocean,
151
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,350
people of this village stay away
from the port at those times.
152
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,970
I see.
153
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,850
He’s been spirited away.
154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,970
That Demon of the Ocean
took someone away again.
155
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,470
Mother, don’t say such reckless things.
156
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,590
Spirited away…
157
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,590
I heard that at the port, too.
158
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,590
Can you give me details about
this spiriting away?
159
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,140
What good will talking
about it do?
160
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,100
But…
161
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,890
Please forgive me.
162
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,220
This isn’t something to be
talked about with outsiders.
163
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,510
Can we do something
about that, please?
164
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
We came here to exterminate
the Demon of the Ocean.
165
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,640
Exterminate the Demon
of the Ocean?
166
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
I see…
167
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,590
For a long time,
168
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,140
there’s been a legend among
fishermen on Demon Island.
169
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,680
A legend?
170
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes, the legend says
don’t come near Demon Island,
171
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,760
“the island where demons live.”
172
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,590
Demon Island has always been
a fishing area rich in fish,
173
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,930
but there were many hidden reefs
and it was a dangerous marine area…
174
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,100
So everybody obeyed the legend.
175
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,590
But one unusually cool summer
about ten years ago,
176
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,640
the fish disappeared from the sea…
177
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,470
We couldn’t help it,
178
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,470
so my husband and I set our feet
into the dangerous marine area.
179
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,800
It was a large catch.
180
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,590
But when I happily came
to the surface of the ocean,
181
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,140
I saw an empty boat with
my husband nowhere to be seen.
182
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,180
Ever since then, one after the next,
183
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,550
anyone who approaches
that island disappeared.
184
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,010
Also, people who went
to search didn’t return.
185
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,010
Since then people from the village
stay away from the island
186
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,600
where spiriting away occurs.
187
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,590
An island nobody goes near…
188
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,140
That’s a peculiar story.
189
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,640
Speaking of which, I heard that
190
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,590
there’s a girl who returned
from being spirited away.
191
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,390
Oh, yes… Isaribi.
192
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,470
Ma’am, I’ve got another favor.
193
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,550
Please tell me where she lives!
194
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,470
Lady Tsunade…
195
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,100
Lady Tsunade!
196
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,590
Yes?
197
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,970
Geez. Here’s the data you requested.
198
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,300
That’s the Land of Sea’s…
199
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,720
You’re worried, after all.
200
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,510
Hm… Well, yes…
201
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,260
The Land of Sea is where Anko,
abandoned by Orochimaru, was found…
202
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,430
Hey! Are you okay!
203
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,890
It’s no good… I can’t remember.
204
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,180
Even though I should know…
205
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,720
It’s dark and cold…
206
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,260
I was in pain… But…
207
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,590
Calm down…
Try taking a little more time.
208
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,590
I’m sure I even got this strange mark
while there…
209
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,590
The suggestion is deep.
210
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,800
Her entire memory is most likely all…
211
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,640
That’s enough…
You’ve had some tough times.
212
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,590
It’s okay.
213
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,050
Right now, we’ll treat this
Curse Mark that’s eating away at you…
214
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,600
We have to do that first.
215
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,550
Lord Hokage…
216
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,800
I…
217
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,600
In the end, her memory didn’t return…
218
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,590
A part of Anko’s memory
remains lost even now.
219
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,930
So that’s what happened…
220
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,140
So, this is the first time Anko’s been
to the Land of Sea since that incident?
221
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,510
Yes… That’s right.
222
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,600
It would be nice if
it could be a catalyst
223
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,430
for bringing back her memories…
224
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,100
What?!
225
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,100
Missed each other?!
226
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,720
They came here?!
227
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,510
Yeah, you should follow
them right away!
228
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,430
And, which way did they go?
229
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,300
That way!
230
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,260
That’s the direction I came!
231
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,680
Damn! Everybody wait up!
232
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,760
The collection ship is moving.
233
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,590
I see, the only girl who returned
from being spirited away.
234
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,430
I thought we should at least go see…
235
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,470
She may have some information
about Demon Island!
236
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,590
Stop!
237
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,140
Oh! That girl!
238
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,050
Sensei!
239
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,760
I wonder where she intends to go?
240
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,260
She’s cautious.
241
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,550
Let’s follow without being noticed.
242
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,930
Hey, everybody! Oh, c’mon.
243
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,850
If I keep going like this,
244
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,430
I'll go all the way to
lsaribi's house again.
245
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,590
That appearance…
246
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,430
It can’t be,
you’re the Demon of the Ocean…?
247
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,640
What?!
248
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,590
I won’t let you escape!
249
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,720
Master Orochimaru…
This is…?
250
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,010
I’m going to teach you
something special.
251
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,760
This is one of the rooms
where I develop Jutsu…
252
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,640
I’d like you to help, too.
253
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,140
But…if the village knew about this…
254
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,590
It’s not going as smoothly as I hoped.
255
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,140
It only needs one more step…
256
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,430
Silly, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
257
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,550
The really frightening thing is
to neglect pursuing the truth.
258
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,180
That girl, could she be…?
259
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,550
Give it up! You can’t escape!
260
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,930
You were the Demon of the Ocean!
261
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,800
Hey, everyone!
262
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,590
Hey!
263
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,720
I finally found you!
264
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,100
Naruto, you’re safe…
265
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,590
But Naruto, you’re too late.
266
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,050
Too late?
267
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,590
We caught the Demon of the Ocean!
Look, this is it.
268
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,350
Oh! Oh?
269
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,390
Huh, so this is
the Demon of the Ocean?!
270
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,760
Isaribi…
271
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,640
Huh?!
272
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,850
Isaribi… You’re Isaribi, aren’t you?!
273
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,890
Naruto! What are you talking about?!
274
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,640
Just wait! Isaribi!
lsaribi, answer me!
275
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,050
Damn it!
276
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,050
Wait up, you!
277
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,590
Wait, don’t be rough.
278
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,430
Explanation must wait.
279
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,300
We’re in trouble if
we let her escape here.
280
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,050
Who are you?! Give Isaribi back!
281
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,220
Like that will happen!
282
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,430
She's an important guinea pig.
283
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,260
If she's lost, I'm responsible for it.
284
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Bastard!
285
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,100
Don’t chase too far…
lt’ll be yesterday all over again.
286
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,850
But!
287
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,590
Crap!
288
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,590
No question about it…
289
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,590
That girl…
290
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,680
Sensei!
291
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,470
What in the world is going on?!
292
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,220
The wind blows, Ah…
293
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,970
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
294
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,590
What should be brought along?
295
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,590
Assemble them into a piece.
296
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,590
There is no second chance, never
297
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,260
How foolish it is to throw away
298
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
299
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,430
The images.
300
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,510
It probably will not end
301
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,760
It probably will not end
302
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,590
Burn that love-filled heart,
303
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,600
Sail across a thousand dreams
304
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,640
Running freely
305
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,430
To take hold of the world in hand
306
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,550
The clouds scatter
307
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,510
The sun sets yet again
308
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,010
The solo parade begins to move.
309
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,350
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
310
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,720
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
311
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,590
Geez! What the heck
are you thinking?!
312
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,300
What do you intend to do alone?!
313
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,760
But I can’t just leave her be!
314
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,010
Even if you were to go after her,
315
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,590
you don’t even have any leads
in the first place!
316
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,850
No, not quite!
317
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,760
– What?! 					– What?!
318
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,510
It seems there’s an island at
the center of this land’s spiriting away.
319
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,050
I get it. Demon Island!
320
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,970
Let’s go after her! As for me,
I can’t just leave her be, believe it!
321
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,100
Next time: “Infiltration: The Set-Up!”
//%
1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,080
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,990
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,290
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,450
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,620
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,160
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,040
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,330
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:19,000
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:28,990
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,000
The smell is moving away…
13
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,120
I’m saved…
14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
Who is?
15
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,990
Please wait!
16
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,410
The real deal…starts now!
17
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,990
My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible…
18
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,160
so, I should’ve avoided big techniques
that could be self-defeating…
19
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,370
But it seems this isn’t an opponent
easy enough to beat
20
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,200
without using my Secret Technique…
21
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,830
Here I go!
22
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,200
I just had surgery
and am not at my best…
23
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,990
But if it’d just be opening the first of the
Eight Inner Gates, the Gate of Opening,
24
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,990
I should somehow…
25
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,120
The first gate… The Gate of Opening…
26
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,450
Open!
27
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,330
Primary Lotus!
28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,990
The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones…?!
29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,750
That’s some speed… But it’s over.
30
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,990
Damn it… No matter how much I think,
I can’t come up with any good strategies…!
31
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,990
I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…
32
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,370
With me right in front of you,
you can’t even howl like a loser…?
33
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,120
Huh?!
34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,500
Die!
35
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,990
You’re mine!
36
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,370
Don’t you be smiling
before you’re going to die!
37
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
What?!
38
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,450
Who’re you?!
39
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,450
It seems you’re an ally this time…
40
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,750
Who’re you?!
41
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,790
A Sand…
42
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,950
Shinobi…
43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,950
ally of the Leaf!
44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,990
The Sand Shinobi:
Allies of the Leaf
45
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,540
The Sand…?! Am I still drunk…?
46
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,200
Gaara of the Desert…
47
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,700
Gaara.
48
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,990
Is that who you are?
49
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,990
Digital Shrapnel!
50
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,830
Did he blow the finger tip bones…?!
51
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,990
Impetuous…
52
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,990
You…
53
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,500
When you fought me…
you had more speed and sharpness.
54
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,870
Easy to say…
55
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,500
It’s not that I’m holding a grudge…
56
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,700
But on account of you,
I had kind of a tough time of it.
57
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,870
I see…
58
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,410
But…why you…?
59
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,040
I owe a lot…
60
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,620
to the Leaf.
61
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,750
Sasuke!
62
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,580
I heard that we’d made up
with the Sand traitors…
63
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,540
But to think you’d change
this abruptly…
64
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,990
It’s not like we attacked the Leaf
for the fun of it…
65
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,200
It was an order…
66
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,950
In the same way
that I’m here now.
67
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,990
I see. The Fifth Hokage
asked the Sand…
68
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,830
It’s a big help.
69
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,450
By the way…
has your sharpness gotten worse?
70
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,450
Huh?
71
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,040
Are you going to give up again
or something?
72
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,870
This time, I’ll do it for you!
73
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,160
Sorry, but I can’t give up.
74
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,750
A man mustn’t be protected
by a woman, so…
75
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,080
As usual, you’re a guy who’s annoying
with the man-and-woman stuff.
76
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,540
Even if you act tough, it’s totally obvious
that it’s bravado, you idiot!
77
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,580
This time you’re taking sides
with the Leaf, huh?!
78
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,250
You guys sure are busy
all over the place!
79
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,870
She uses Genjutsu
with the sound of her flute.
80
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,830
Right!
81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,160
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!
82
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,870
Blowing away the sounds of the flute
83
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,750
and being able to nail the opponent
with a physical attack.
84
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,990
To think she can attack and defend
with one hand…
85
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,830
Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu.
86
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,990
That woman’s a natural enemy to me!
87
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,990
Has Ukon…just about caught him
according to the strategy?
88
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,990
Puppet, huh…?
89
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,910
You three had been approaching
together, right?
90
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,870
Two went on ahead.
91
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,990
You guys are weak, so…
92
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,700
You idiot… These guys are
out of the ordinary!
93
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,990
Behind you!
94
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,080
I can’t…move.
95
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,790
What’s this guy?
96
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,370
I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!
97
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,540
Where’s the other one?
98
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,790
Hey! Who are you looking for?
99
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,160
That state… I know!
100
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,200
Be careful!
They enter the body and start to fuse!
101
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,200
It’s too late.
102
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,250
This guy!
103
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,200
What’s the matter, Sakon?!
104
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,870
It seems like…
105
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,990
your Jutsu didn’t work…
on the puppet.
106
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,080
This is a puppet, too?!
107
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,450
Let me tell you this.
108
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,830
We, the Sand Ninja,
aren’t as lax as the Leaf.
109
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,160
Moreover, don’t be carelessly
approaching…
110
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,200
the Black Ant!
111
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,790
He was fearsome
when he was an enemy...
112
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,990
But to think he’d be this dependable
when becoming an ally.
113
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,370
Ow… I got careless.
Let me rest in your body for a bit.
114
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,450
Good-for-nothing guy…
115
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,790
Who are these guys?
116
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,950
This is their ability!
117
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,040
Although you were caught off guard…
118
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,000
you getting hammered
by that puppet play…
119
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,830
Well…
120
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,750
Its power and speed
are nothing special.
121
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,660
I won’t be beaten
by the likes of such a toy.
122
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,080
And I was able
to heal my belly wound.
123
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,500
I don’t have much Chakra left…
but well,
124
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,910
these are opponents I should be able
to tear apart, nevertheless.
125
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,990
Indeed, it seems he’s healed.
What a recovery ability he’s got.
126
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,700
Ordinarily, I’m not the one
who becomes the main body,
127
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,580
so it’s hard to move, damn it.
128
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,870
You sure are mocking us…
129
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,620
He’s not an opponent
you can beat fighting head on!
130
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,040
We should retreat for now and…
131
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,160
We can’t back down after having been
mocked, you know.
132
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,750
Don’t mess with me!
133
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,540
The Black Ant isn’t a Mechanism
for attacking.
134
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,160
Primarily, it’s just for capturing.
135
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,990
And…Crow paired up with the Black Ant
is exclusively for attacking.
136
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,990
Hey you! Let me out!
137
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,250
Eat this!
138
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,580
Puppet Show…
139
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,830
Hey, let me out! Let me out!
140
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,990
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
141
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,870
The play is over.
142
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,950
She hid, huh…?
143
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,990
Or did she run away?
144
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,950
No…That couldn’t be…
145
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,830
I just got here.
146
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,990
Briefly explain the present situation
147
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,990
including an analysis of her ability
and battle style.
148
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,660
First off, her fundamental tactic is
ensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu
149
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,200
with the sound of her flute.
150
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,700
And then she delivers physical attacks
to that opening.
151
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,990
Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
152
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,410
This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?
153
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,580
I can’t move my body…!
154
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,990
I believe this was your last hand, right?
155
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,950
Unfortunately…
this is reversed checkmate!
156
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,200
You little rat!
157
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,990
She’s a classic Genjutsu-style
distance range type.
158
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,080
Most likely, she must’ve seen your Jutsu
and figured out immediately
159
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,990
that it wouldn’t mix well
with her own Jutsu.
160
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,990
And it’s two against one, too.
161
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,950
She’ll never appear before us again
until she casts her Genjutsu.
162
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,540
Sound, huh…?
163
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,410
Yeah…
164
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,250
Genjutsu generally appeal
to the five senses of people…
165
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,540
sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
166
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,910
The type that uses hearing
is the most troublesome of them all.
167
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,750
After she cleverly takes a distance on you
and then hides…
168
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,250
you have no idea where the Genjutsu
will be cast from or when.
169
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,990
The idea is for us to already be cast
by the Genjutsu
170
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,080
by the time we’ve figured out where she is
by the sound of the flute…
171
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,910
Ouch…
172
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,080
In my opinion, we’re at an
overwhelming disadvantage.
173
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,250
A battle with this type, essentially,
wouldn’t even be worth talking about
174
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,370
without sensor types
like Kiba or Neji.
175
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,990
At this rate, we’ll get pushed into a corner
sooner or later.
176
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,700
– We should just retreat…
– Who asked for your opinion?!
177
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
I told you to just explain the situation.
178
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,990
Don’t misjudge my power…
179
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,750
If she thinks
she’s hiding well from me…
180
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,870
in a distance enough for the sound
of her flute to reach…
181
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,990
she’s naïve!
182
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,580
Summoning: Blade Dance
183
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,950
Cut!
184
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,950
All right…
185
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,660
I’ve made it this far.
lt’s about time for my Genjutsu…
186
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,500
Huh?
187
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
How about it?
188
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,250
It’s done.
189
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,450
She’s sure…pushy.
190
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,160
She’s scarier than my mom.
191
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,540
Pretty good, huh?
192
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,250
But well…
193
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,410
I just have to be grateful
for this time…huh?
194
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,160
For the first time, I spoke to you
195
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,290
And you smiled
196
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,950
For the first time, I was able to speak
197
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,700
In my own words
198
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,250
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
199
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,910
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
200
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,500
My clumsy attempts with words
201
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,160
You listened without turning away
202
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,450
No wonder I get carried away by you
203
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:11,540
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
204
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,790
I feel so sad
205
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,750
But…
206
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,080
For the first time, I spoke to you
207
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,120
And you smiled
208
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,990
For the first time, I was able to speak
209
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,990
In my own words
210
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,500
For the first time, I spoke to you
211
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,750
And you smiled
212
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,160
For the first time, I was able to speak
213
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,120
In my own words
214
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,910
For the first time, I spoke to you
215
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,910
I got careless earlier,
but it won’t be like that now!
216
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,240
Now, you please stand back.
217
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,090
I’m grateful for the help,
but his opponent will be me!
218
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,430
Next, for sure,
with my ultimate Lotus…!
219
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,220
Hey, why are you moving forward?
I’m his opponent!
220
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,390
Next episode,
“Showdown: Gaara vs. Kimimaro!”
//%
1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:13,960
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,640
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,650
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,660
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,330
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,900
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:17,660
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,000
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,230
Our two hearts
11
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,120
Stop that!
12
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,490
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
13
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,560
I’m not handing Gantetsu over
to you, no matter what!
14
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,420
That’s…
15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
It can’t be…!
16
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,620
To Each His Own Path
17
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,730
You… You mean you ripped
through my net?!
18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,030
I can cut through a weak flimsy net
like that with a single bite!
19
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,810
It’s useless! You won’t be able to
tear through my Mesh Cage!
20
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,850
I’m gonna have Gantetsu back!
21
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,790
I’m telling you, it’s useless!
22
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,860
Damn it! I can’t get this thing off!
23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,790
Here, just die already!
24
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
–Naruto! 					–Naruto!
25
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,710
You’re mine!
26
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,120
Too bad!
27
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,790
So it’s you who’s gonna die,
after all!
28
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,260
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
29
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,990
Go!
30
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,360
This is the end for you!
31
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
What’s that?!
32
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,640
Shura, on the scene!
33
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,650
The kid! The kid inside that net
knows where the treasure is!
34
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,790
Good job, Monju!
35
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,330
Akio!
36
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Akio…?!
37
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,170
–Akio! Bro! 					–Akio! Bro!
38
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,110
Thank you.
39
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
Gantetsu…
40
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,950
I heard you say the name Akio,
just now…
41
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
Who in the world is that kid?
42
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,320
That kid… Akio…
43
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,360
He’s your…
He’s your little brother.
44
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,530
Th-That’s a lie!
45
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,770
My younger brother…
My younger brother has…
46
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,210
In those flames…
47
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,650
Akio…
48
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,060
You…killed him…!
49
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
No!
50
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,530
Gantetsu hasn’t killed anybody!
51
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,770
He rescued us! He rescued Akio!
52
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,770
Five years ago.
53
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,810
I had developed a distate for
the Ninja Dropout’s way…
54
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,450
I found myself carrying Akio…
55
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Akio!
56
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,490
Elder brother!
57
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,660
No! You’ll inhale smoke!
58
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Damn it!
59
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,700
I thought I could change a little
if I could only save that child.
60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,040
But that’s not what happened!
61
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,650
I just continued to create
victims like Akio.
62
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,850
So that’s why I started planning
what’s happening right now
63
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,650
in order to exterminate
the Ninja Dropouts.
64
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,420
So that’s what happened…
65
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,660
–Gantetsu!
–Gantetsu, are you all right?
66
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,900
You’re not hurt, are you?
67
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,200
I’m glad you’re ok.
68
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,700
They are children from the houses
that the Ninja Dropouts attacked…
69
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,770
Using the money Gantetsu poached
from the gang,
70
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,580
Akio, the oldest, has been
taking care of them.
71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,950
Gantetsu is just like
the central figure of a family.
72
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,020
I can’t believe this…
73
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,820
You mean that…the kid who
was there just now was…
74
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,990
Akio!!
75
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,940
Where are you going…Gantetsu?!
76
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,840
To the Ninja Dropouts' hideout.
77
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,650
I’m gonna get…Akio back!
78
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,750
I will get Akio back! Your only job
is to guide me there!
79
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,660
Don’t interfere!
80
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,230
Todoroki, I understand how you feel.
81
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,200
However, Gantetsu saved Akio
and all these other kids
82
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,530
from the Ninja Dropouts!
83
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,670
Besides, there’s something
you should do before that!
84
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,870
Don’t mess around with me!
85
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,640
Even so, this guy…Gantetsu…
is a member of the Ninja Dropouts.
86
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,310
The Ninja Dropouts killed my parents!
87
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,780
You’re absolutely right.
88
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,420
My own crime will never
be washed away.
89
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,620
As soon as I get Akio back…
you can…do whatever you like to me!
90
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
I’m going, too!
91
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Me, too!
92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,670
Then, Sakura, please look
after the children!
93
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,770
Leave it to me!
94
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,670
Todoroki…
95
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,640
I’ve continued hating that guy
for five years…
96
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,480
What am I supposed to do now…?
97
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,450
Damn it!
98
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,190
In any case, we’ve got to take care
of your little brother right now!
99
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
I know that!
100
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,560
This time for sure…
I’ll rescue Akio!
101
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,650
Where did you stash our treasure?!
102
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,650
Where’s your hideout?!
103
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,650
Come on! Talk!
104
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,060
I’ll never…tell you!
105
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,390
You little brat!
106
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,770
That’s the Ninja Dropouts’ hideout…
107
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,910
That residence belongs
to Shura, the leader.
108
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,650
I’m pretty sure that’s where Akio will be.
109
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,650
Akio…
110
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,790
Oh! Hey! Todoroki! Wait!
111
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,660
Damn!
112
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
This ain’t good! They’ll detect us!
113
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,330
Leaf Hurricane!
114
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,330
Let me handle this situation!
115
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,600
I leave it to you, Bushy-Brows.
116
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,000
Akio!
117
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,570
This way.
118
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,480
I’m pretty sure that Akio is
being tortured in the basement…
119
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,650
That guy was once a Ninja.
120
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
There’s no telling what
he’ll try to do.
121
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,650
I’ll go first.
122
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Akio!
123
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,770
W-Wait!
124
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,170
Akio…!
125
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,580
Gantetsu…!
126
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,650
You jerk…!
127
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,710
Don’t come over here!
128
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,490
Gantetsu!
129
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,650
Akio!
130
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,190
Hey! Gantetsu!
131
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,660
So only one animal got caught
in the net, huh…?
132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Shura!
133
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,400
He’s one stubborn brat.
He never unsealed his lips.
134
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,700
I’ll use another method to
get back the treasure.
135
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,640
After I’ve killed the lot of you!
136
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,400
Naruto, pursue Shura!
137
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,070
We’ll be fine! Iron bars
like this are nothing!
138
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,010
Got it!
139
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Todoroki, I’m leaving this
in your hands!
140
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,110
Farewell.
141
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,250
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
142
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,000
Todoroki, you take care of Akio!
143
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,280
Todoroki!
144
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,170
Blood Rain!
145
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,350
I won’t forgive you…
no matter what!
146
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,020
Rasengan!
147
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,600
So that’s what happened…
148
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,070
Gantetsu…
that’s how you protected Akio…
149
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,900
Yet I… I…!
150
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,600
Gantetsu! Give me Akio!
151
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,750
Elder brother…
you came to rescue me, after all…
152
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,850
Hang in there, Akio!
153
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,620
My elder brother…
Todoroki, it's really you, isn't it?
154
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,020
This spells the end of the Ninja Dropout.
155
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,650
Yeah…
156
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,650
That’s right.
157
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,530
But where is Naruto?
158
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,060
Hey!
159
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,670
Naruto Uzumaki! On the scene…!
160
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,570
Naruto! Lee!
161
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,640
Akio!
162
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,110
Akio’s back!
163
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,250
It’s Akio…!
164
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,980
Are you all right, Akio?!
165
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,190
Yeah…
166
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,650
Oh my gosh, you’re hurt!
167
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,660
I’m fine. It’s nothing!
168
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,290
Sakura, could you
take care of his wound?
169
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
Leave it to me.
170
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Take care of him.
171
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,740
Apologies for the inconvenience…
Let’s head to the capital.
172
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,280
I just cannot forgive you.
173
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,860
But it is true that you rescued Akio.
174
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,560
The Ninja Dropouts
have been annihilated.
175
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,660
Gantetsu got caught up
and died in the fighting
176
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,370
that ensued while being escorted.
177
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,640
Elder brother…
178
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Todoroki…
179
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,150
Yeah! Great! That's great!
180
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,650
You’re gonna stay here, right?
181
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Huh?
182
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,960
You’re gonna stay here with Gantetsu
and the other children, right?
183
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,770
I haven’t been a good brother…
184
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,540
But you are an irreplaceable
elder brother for those children.
185
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Elder brother…
186
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,750
What's this…?
187
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,650
This is the souvenir that
188
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,650
I didn’t have a chance to
give you back then.
189
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,660
Elder brother… Thank you.
190
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,640
Let’s go! Ninja!
191
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,210
Okay!
192
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,640
–Good bye! 					–Good bye!
193
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,910
–Take care, everyone!
194
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
–See you!
195
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:42,290
–Bye! 					–See you!
196
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,170
Hey… How are we gonna
get out of this forest…
197
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,070
without Gantetsu?!
198
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,640
We can’t go back now!
199
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,640
We took this path earlier
on too, didn’t we…?
200
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,240
I’m starving…
201
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,380
I can’t go on.
202
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,420
Hey! Somebody rescue us!
203
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,660
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
204
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,900
Will always be smiling right near by
205
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,680
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
206
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,410
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
207
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,320
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
208
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,160
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
209
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,100
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
210
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,500
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
211
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,800
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
212
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:15,310
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
213
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,220
The wind is probably testing our hearts
214
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,520
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
215
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,660
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
216
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,530
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
217
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,170
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
218
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,310
Will always be smiling right near by
219
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,450
Naruto, what on earth were you thinking?
220
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,150
What? I only brought an injured person
to the hospital.
221
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,290
But to bring an outsider
into the village…
222
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,660
But I’m sure he is not a bad guy at all.
223
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,490
I understand your feelings,
but he has amnesia.
224
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,460
There is a possibility that
he’s an enemy spy.
225
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,530
Please, Grandma.
226
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,400
I’ll make an exception,
just this one time.
227
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,000
But you will be his keeper, and will be
held accountable for all his actions.
228
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
That’s all.
229
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,070
Next time: “Vanished Memories”
//%
1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:14,290
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,990
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,990
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,990
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,660
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,250
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:05,290
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:17,990
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,330
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,580
Our two hearts
11
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,250
No way…
12
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,450
To think Old Man Hokage would
try to eliminate Yakumo.
13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,250
No way could that ever happen!
14
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,200
But if by some remote chance,
15
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,870
Kurenai Sensei
accepted such a mission…
16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,160
it would explain her strange behavior.
17
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,500
No, no way!
No way that could ever happen.
18
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,080
Are you okay, Kurenai Sensei…?
19
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,750
Yes. I feel quite a bit better now
thanks to your first-aid…
20
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,290
Who in the world is
Kurenai Sensei protecting?
21
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,160
It was the Third Hokage who
told her to take custody of Yakumo…
22
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,990
What in the world is her real mission…?
23
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,990
What's going on?!
24
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,870
Th-That's…
25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,950
Th-The Village Hidden in the Leaves is…
26
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,540
No way…!
27
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,330
Genjutsu or Reality?
28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,660
It’s like the aftermath of
a large war that broke out.
29
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Hinata!
30
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Right…
31
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Byakugan!
32
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,000
There’s not a person in the village…
33
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,990
What is this…?
34
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,500
What’s going on here?!
35
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,990
Kiba, Hinata…
ls there anything unusual in the area?
36
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,870
No enemy signs anywhere…
37
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,290
Akamaru doesn’t sense
the scent of any outsiders, either.
38
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,450
What happened in the village
while we were away…?
39
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,040
First, let’s take Yakumo and
Kurenai Sensei to the hospital.
40
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,990
We’ll check out the village after that…
41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
R-Right…!
42
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,370
Leaf Hospital
43
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,990
What’s this…?
44
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,950
Anyway, let’s get these two
to a hospital room…
45
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,790
I’m okay.
More importantly, take care of Yakumo.
46
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Right…
47
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,290
You’re out of danger now…
48
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,870
Oh, no…She’s unconscious!
49
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,080
Her vital signs are weakening…
50
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,120
I wonder if there’s any medicine left…
51
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,120
Naruto, help me look…
52
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,620
Oh, well, but…
53
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,910
Just hurry!
54
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,950
R-Right…
55
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,540
There’s no scent of blood.
56
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,160
Everyone must have
evacuated somewhere.
57
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,990
Let’s us check out the village.
58
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Right…
59
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,830
Make sure you three
always act together…
60
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,910
Come back here in thirty minutes,
no matter what.
61
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
Right…
62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
What is it?
63
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,990
Sure enough, you have to be the one
to give us orders, Kurenai Sensei!
64
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,790
What’s been the matter with you?!
65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,290
The pharmacy is that way.
66
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,990
Nothing. I was just concerned
about Kurenai Sensei…
67
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,870
So let’s hurry and get the medicine!
68
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,620
I mean, Kurenai Sensei’s going to…
eliminate…Yakumo…
69
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Eliminate?
70
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,990
Th-Th-That couldn’t be…
71
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,750
I was just kind of out of it.
72
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,990
Huh?
73
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,910
Huh…? What was that?!
74
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,450
What is it, Sakura?!
75
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,620
There’s someone here other than us.
76
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,990
What?!
77
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,450
That’s close!
78
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,990
I’ll leave the two in
the hospital room to you, Sakura!
79
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,080
I’m going after him!
80
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Got it!
81
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,160
Hold it! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
82
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,370
Huh?! My Jutsu won’t activate?!
83
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,290
Wait! This isn’t the time
to be fighting.
84
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,540
You guys are the ones who
attacked the mountain cottage, right?!
85
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,370
I am Unkai of the Kurama Clan…
86
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,120
Kurama?!
The same clan as Yakumo?!
87
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,370
Why would her clan attack her?!
88
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,540
Listen to me!
lf you don’t, everyone will die!
89
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,000
What's this smell of blood?!
90
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Byakugan!
91
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,410
Close your Byakugan, Hinata!
92
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,990
Kiba, restrain Akamaru’s
sense of smell!
93
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,160
–What?! 					–What is it?!
94
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,000
It’s because we’re caught
in someone’s Jutsu.
95
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Say what?!
96
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,870
Yes. We’re now inside
Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
97
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,160
It may seem as if the Leaf Village
was in a war.
98
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,580
But this is merely
a part of her Genjutsu.
99
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsu
and we’ve all been trapped in it?
100
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,580
That’s totally impossible!
101
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,700
But if her latent powers have awakened,
it wouldn’t be hard at all.
102
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,870
This whole village?!
103
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,700
This ground we’re standing on,
this sky, everything is Genjutsu?!
104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,990
There are occasions when
superior senses become a hindrance.
105
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,990
It’s because no matter how superior
the sense of sight or smell might be,
106
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,080
ultimately it’s the human brain that
processes and perceives the information!
107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,370
There are times when
well-developed brains make errors
108
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,580
in the process of interpreting
complex electric signals.
109
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,580
However, insects act only
with sharp senses.
110
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,750
Unlike the information processed
with a human brain,
111
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,950
insects narrow this information down
to the very minimum.
112
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,990
Look. My insects
are still under control.
113
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,250
They will not be deceived.
114
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,790
There are occasions when
115
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,500
Yakumo’s Genjutsu
summons thunderclouds
116
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,830
and produces fire.
117
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,990
And that is planted directly into
the human brain
118
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,040
as if it had occurred in reality.
119
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,290
And that causes the brain
to hurt one’s own body.
120
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,750
Then, Grandma’s house…
121
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,290
That’s also Yakumo’s power?!
122
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,990
It’s not just that…
123
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,330
She can even kill people easily
if she were so inclined.
124
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,990
But these tremors…
125
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,290
Are you saying this is also Genjutsu?
126
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,990
You’ll see any moment now…
127
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,540
A-A snake!
128
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,990
It’s too huge!
129
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,120
Is that also Genjutsu?!
130
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,750
It’s a terrifying image that
our cerebrums have created.
131
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,250
Physical influence is absolutely…
132
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,990
unthinkable!
133
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
No way!
134
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,120
Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?!
135
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Huh?!
136
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,950
Really…? Yakumo can kill people
with Genjutsu..?
137
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,990
So is that why the Third Hokage
tried to eliminate her?
138
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,370
Yakumo, Yakumo?!
139
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,200
Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai Sensei…
140
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,660
Over here… Kurenai Sensei…
141
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,450
I still can’t believe it.
142
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,990
To think Yakumo would do
something like that!
143
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,950
Once every several generations,
144
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,040
a child is born into our Kurama Clan
with physical idiosyncrasies.
145
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,990
That child is Yakumo…
146
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,990
Moreover, what’s terrifying is her
using her powers unconsciously
147
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,040
without being able to control it.
148
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,750
It’s getting kind of hot.
149
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,990
Don’t!
150
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,990
What’s happening
outside the door…?
151
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Don’t open it!
152
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,990
Wh-What’s this…?
153
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,200
Why’s there lava here…?
154
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,870
That’s an illusion our brains have
created due to Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
155
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,990
But even it’s an illusion,
if we were to dive into the lava,
156
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,990
our brains would determine it to be lava
and our bodies would burn up.
157
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,950
That is Yakumo’s power.
158
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,990
So is that why Old Man Hokage
and Kurenai Sensei
159
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,080
tried to eliminate Yakumo?
160
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,830
That’s not it.
161
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,950
What they really
attempted to kill
162
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,990
was the monster
existing inside Yakumo.
163
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
A monster?
164
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,910
Before too long,
Yakumo’s massive powers
165
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,750
created a terrifying monster.
166
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,290
If left alone, the monster that
continues to grow would
167
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,500
someday attempt to
become one with her
168
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,910
by absorbing
Yakumo’s consciousness.
169
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,290
The Third Hokage and Kurenai
determined as such
170
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,410
and all there was to do in order
to save Yakumo was to seal her powers.
171
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
A monster in her body…
172
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,990
So that’s what it was…
173
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,500
I can’t just sit back like this!
174
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,370
Oh!
175
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,450
Oh. My entire fortune!
176
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,990
I told you. If you dive into the lava,
you’re body will really burn up.
177
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,990
Then does that mean
we can’t get out of here?!
178
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,990
No, there is one way.
179
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,580
What’s that way?!
180
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,000
If you seal your five senses,
the Genjutsu cannot affect the body.
181
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,990
You must escape from this world
and attack Yakumo!
182
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,580
What?! Attack Yakumo?!
183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,250
Ow-ow-ow!
184
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,790
What? This is…Satomi Hill?!
185
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,990
Old Man Unkai!
186
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,950
It seems you safely made it
out of Yakumo’s Genjutsu…
187
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,990
What the heck happened…?!
188
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,750
At the point you brought Yakumo
out of the mountain cottage,
189
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,410
you were already
caught in her Genjutsu.
190
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
What?!
191
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,950
Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!
192
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,990
Kiba!
193
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Shino!
194
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,500
Wh-Where are we…?
195
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,910
Sakura, examine
Old Man Unkai’s wounds.
196
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,990
Unkai…?
197
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,540
What happened?!
These are awful burns!
198
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,250
We were able to get out of
Yakumo’s Genjutsu
199
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,250
thanks to this old man!
200
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,870
Rather, I’d say
we were driven out…
201
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,750
Her only target was
Yuhi Kurenai, after all…
202
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,370
Where’s Kurenai Sensei now?
203
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,200
Well, probably…
204
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,410
Yakumo…
205
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,580
Kurenai Sensei…
What do you think of my paintings…?
206
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,120
Aren’t they wonderful?!
207
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,790
What did you do to everyone?
208
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,330
Don’t worry…
I just drove out the intruders…
209
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,290
Eventually, I must have my revenge
on the Leaf Village…
210
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,290
But first, I have some business
with you, Sensei.
211
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,040
Why include the Leaf Village as well…?
212
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I should be enough of a target
for your revenge…!
213
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,500
I won’t let you say
you don’t know!
214
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,410
How is it? 					Awesome, huh?
215
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,080
I have complete control now of letting
you live or killing you, Sensei.
216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,790
Tell me the truth…
217
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,990
It was the Third Hokage who ordered
my father and mother killed and
218
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,620
the Kurama Clan and me eliminated
from the Leaf Village, right?
219
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,990
No.
220
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,620
The Third Hokage did not order
such a mission…
221
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,700
Why do you lie?!
222
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,330
Please.
223
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,700
Tell me the truth!
224
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,990
You’ll vanish if you don’t,
Kurenai Sensei…
225
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,990
Such a sad child…
226
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,990
If killing me will eliminate your suffering,
then you should do it.
227
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,990
If your hate will vanish along
with your suffering!
228
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,410
Why do you cry?
I won’t be deceived by tears like that!
229
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:38,370
1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005!
230
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,990
Yeah, it feels good in
every kind of weather to sweat.
231
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,500
So the Kurama Clan are still here!
Might Guy will take you on!
232
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,830
W-Wait, Guy!
233
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,990
Huh?! G-Guy?
234
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,580
I see. So you guys were also
caught in the Kurama Genjutsu…
235
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,870
I’m sorry.
236
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,990
Well, you’re alive and
that’s all that matters.
237
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,290
Thank goodness,
thank goodness.
238
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,450
Oh, you guys are back!
239
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,990
Where are the village reinforcements?!
240
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,990
There’s no time to explain!
241
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,370
What?!
242
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,200
Oh, hey! Wait, you guys!
243
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,660
What’s up with them?!
244
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,750
Who’s that man…?
And what about everyone?
245
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,870
Please, just help me out, Guy Sensei.
246
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,990
But, well…
247
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,580
Just hurry!
248
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,660
R-Right…
249
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Byakugan!
250
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Those jerks…
251
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,080
No, Yakumo!
252
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,990
Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei
are in the innermost room.
253
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,290
All right!
254
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,790
Hey, wait!
255
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,660
Kiba!
256
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,990
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
257
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:30,200
Will always be smiling right near by
258
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,990
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
259
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
260
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,620
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
261
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,450
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
262
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,410
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
263
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,790
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
264
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,120
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
265
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,620
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
266
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,500
The wind is probably testing our hearts
267
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,830
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
268
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,990
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
269
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,830
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
270
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,450
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
271
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,620
Will always be smiling right near by
272
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,330
Everyone, what’s the current situation?
273
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,990
Naruto hasn’t come back
since he first went in.
274
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,410
The insects had also detected
something strange and emerged.
275
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,290
Can you use your Byakugan
to look inside?
276
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,990
There’s some kind of powerful force
that’s getting in the way.
277
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,160
So all we can do is watch here?
278
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,990
Does this mean that all
we can do is believe in him and wait?
279
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,080
Next time:
"The Supposed Sealed Ability"
//%
1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:14,290
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,990
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,990
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,990
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,660
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,250
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:05,290
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:17,990
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,330
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,580
Our two hearts
11
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,410
The Bewildering Forest
12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,990
Hey kids, get out of here
if you don’t wanna get hurt.
13
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,450
Better not think lightly of me!
14
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,700
I’m not gonna hand this guy over,
no matter what!
15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,990
Ninja Dropouts…
16
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,200
It’s not gonna end up with
you just getting hurt.
17
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,990
You’re gonna get killed.
18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,250
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
19
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,870
Ninja Art: Blood Rain.
20
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,120
Todoroki!
21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,950
Damn!
22
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,040
My Jutsu isn’t Ninjutsu.
23
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,990
It’s Killer Jutsu.
24
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,700
Sakura!
25
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,700
Lee, are you all right?
26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,290
Yeah, just barely.
More importantly, where’s Naruto?
27
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,000
Is everybody safe?
28
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,660
Yes. However, Commander Todoroki
is nowhere to be seen!
29
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,950
What was that?!
30
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,080
Naruto…
31
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,910
Naruto…
32
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,250
Die!
33
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,250
Damn! Let go, you jerk!
34
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,990
Naruto!
35
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,540
Damn!
36
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,990
Father! Mother!
37
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,000
Akio!
38
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,870
Akio!
39
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,910
What a shame…
40
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
You’re not getting back
with your comrades.
41
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,990
Todoroki! Gantetsu!
42
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,330
Are you all right?!
43
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,990
Y-Yeah… We’re fine.
44
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,950
What are we going to do now?
45
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,870
We’ve gotten separated from
Sakura and Bushy Brows…
46
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,080
There isn’t any question in my mind.
47
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,990
It’s my mission to deliver
this guy to the capital.
48
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,290
But the ship’s been destroyed, and…
49
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,370
Those guys are pursuing us!
50
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,080
What are you doing?!
51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,250
If they’re gonna steal this guy
away from us anyway,
52
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,540
it would be better to
take care of him right here!
53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,040
What do you mean take care of him…?
54
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,910
Even if we delivered him the capital,
55
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,990
it’s certain that
he’ll be sentenced to death…
56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,990
Therefore…
57
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,370
Rather than having them
take him away, it would be better to…!
58
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,990
It’s not set in stone that
they’ll be able to take him away!
59
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,160
Let’s go!
60
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,450
Your mission is to guard this guy, right?
61
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,410
That’s exactly what my mission is too!
62
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,000
If you so much as try anything,
your head’s gonna roll!
63
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,620
Run!
64
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,160
We’ll be fine…
now that we’ve come this far…
65
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,290
Looks like we’ve totally lost them.
66
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,500
We’ve gone pretty deep
into the forest, haven’t we?
67
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,790
I can get our bearings from
the position of the moon.
68
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,370
It’s too dangerous to go back
to the river.
69
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,700
We’ll continue straight through
this forest to the capital.
70
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,540
Because it’s my mission.
71
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,990
Are you sure it’ll be okay?
72
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,700
What do you mean?
73
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,200
You said earlier you were going
to finish this guy off, right?
74
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,620
I was talking about
a worst-case scenario.
75
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,120
Got it…
Well then, let’s get moving.
76
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,450
I wonder if Sakura is all right…
77
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,830
Naruto…
78
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,330
It’s Naruto…
He’s gonna be just fine.
79
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,750
Yeah…
80
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,540
So let’s hurry up and link up with him!
81
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,290
Lee!
82
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,410
I detect something strange…
83
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Where…?
84
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,410
Up above!
85
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,290
Lee!
86
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,990
Let’s follow him!
The enemy might have captured Naruto!
87
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,620
What’s the matter?
88
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,290
We’re walking in the direction
of the moon, right…?
89
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,950
Then why is the moon following us?
90
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,450
That’s strange…
91
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,540
What’s going on…?
92
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,620
The Forest of Bewilderment…
93
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,370
Once you get lost you can
never find you way out again.
94
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,290
He talked…
95
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,990
You are in custody.
You’re not allowed to talk!
96
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,540
Wait a second!
97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,870
The Forest of Bewilderment…
98
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,830
You know something about this place?
99
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,910
What do you know? Tell us!
100
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,990
The Ninja Dropouts have
a hide-out in this forest.
101
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,330
What was that?!
102
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,290
So we were escorting you
through Ninja Dropout territory…?!
103
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,330
This forest is perfect for a hide-out.
104
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,660
The fog, the winds that
sweep through the forest,
105
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,990
the extreme magnetic fields…
106
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,450
They all make a person lose
their sense of direction.
107
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,330
A person finding himself in
this forest for the first time
108
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,990
will never find his way out.
109
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,830
I don’t believe that…
110
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,200
There’s no way we won’t find
our way out…?
111
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,330
You guys won’t.
112
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,290
Huh?
113
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,040
But for me, a member of
the Ninja Dropouts…
114
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,200
the outcome will be different.
115
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,950
I will…
116
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,450
I will guide you through this forest.
117
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,250
Yeah, that’s right…
118
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,370
For you, a Ninja Dropout,
this forest is like your backyard, right?
119
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,620
Okay then, let’s have you guide us!
120
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you some kind of idiot?!
121
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,120
It’s true…
122
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,410
The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts
showed earlier on
123
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,870
makes sense if you think
that this is their garden…
124
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,370
And I’ll believe you when you say
you have a hide-out here.
125
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,950
Then even more so…
126
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,120
Even more so, it's a no!
127
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,290
Huh…?
128
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,790
Don’t you get it?
129
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,000
This guy is gonna pretend to
be guiding us out of the forest
130
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
but will actually be taking us
to the hide-out.
131
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,990
Todoroki…
132
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,990
This is an emergency situation…
133
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,660
If we don’t kill him, we’ll be killed.
134
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,160
W-Wait a minute!
135
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,450
Nobody’s gonna care…if this guy dies!
136
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,290
Todoroki!
137
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,450
What’s that…?
138
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,990
I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts
had stolen up to now…
139
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,750
So I was tortured…
140
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,370
Those guys don’t want to rescue me…
141
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,250
They just want to get that money
back from me.
142
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,000
Once they have the money back,
those guys will kill me too.
143
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,990
Do you really think I’ll believe that?
144
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,450
Wait a second!
145
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,990
The Ninja Dropouts hide-out is
here in this forest, right…?
146
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,540
Which means it’s like
a backyard to them too,
147
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,910
just like it is for Gantetsu…
148
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,990
Which means that…
149
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,660
Which means that what?
150
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,450
Well, since we've trespassed
into their garden
151
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,580
it’s likely that the Ninja Dropouts
will come after us
152
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,250
whether Gantetsu’s
betrayed them or not…
153
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,160
So I think our only option is to
pin our hopes on this guy…
154
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,990
Am I wrong?
155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,700
Hey, are you sure
you know what you’re doing?
156
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,620
Yeah, everything’s fine.
157
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,950
Those guys won’t figure out
this kind of circuitous route.
158
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,660
Can we really trust this guy…?
159
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,540
What?!
160
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,990
I’m used to it’s venom. It’s nothing.
161
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,750
Are you really gonna be all right?
162
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,990
Yeah…
163
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,450
Hey!
164
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,990
What’s the matter?
165
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
No way!
166
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,700
You fell for it. You fell for it!
167
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,500
Here it comes!
168
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,990
Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!
169
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,660
Die!
170
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,790
You’re the one who fell for it!
171
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,290
I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.
172
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,790
What was that?!
173
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,750
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
174
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,660
Now it’s my turn!
175
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,120
Rasengan!
176
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,330
I’m gonna strike you down!
177
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,160
Don’t think it’s gonna be that
easy to strike me down!
178
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,120
Like I'll let you get away!
179
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,830
Naruto!
180
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,830
That guy! Trying to get away, huh!
181
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,870
What are you doing?
182
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,200
Th-That sound is…
183
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,290
What?!
184
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,540
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
185
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,580
Rasengan!
186
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,540
Thanks to you we made it…Gantetsu.
187
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,790
What's with you guys?
188
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,290
They want to fight, it seems.
189
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,040
I won’t… I won’t be fooled.
You…you…
190
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,990
We’ll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.
191
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,200
Todoroki!
192
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,870
Stop it, Todoroki!
193
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,790
You said you were going to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital, right?
194
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,200
This guy…
195
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,870
There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy!
196
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,500
What are you talking about?!
197
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,330
This guy…
198
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,000
This guy killed my family…
he killed my little brother!
199
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,580
Wh-What was that…?
200
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,990
Gantetsu…
201
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,910
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
202
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:30,080
Will always be smiling right near by
203
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,990
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
204
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,580
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
205
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,500
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
206
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,330
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
207
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,290
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
208
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,660
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
209
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,000
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
210
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:15,500
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
211
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,370
The wind is probably testing our hearts
212
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,700
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
213
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,870
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
214
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,700
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
215
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,330
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
216
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:44,500
Will always be smiling right near by
217
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,620
It’s true that Gantetsu may be evil,
218
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,290
but how is taking revenge out
on him going to change things?!
219
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,370
Isn’t our mission to take Gantetsu
to the capital?
220
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,000
And I… I don’t think that
he’s an evil person.
221
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,580
Anyway, you leave me
no choice if you won’t listen.
222
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,990
I’ll stop you with all my strength!
223
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,990
Next time: “Memory of Flames”
//%
1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:13,860
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,540
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,230
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,800
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,900
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,130
Our two hearts
11
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,360
Please, Sensei!
12
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,680
– What?! 					– What?!
13
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,550
Whoa, my heart, my heart!
14
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,590
Huh? There's nothing wrong.
15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,630
Hey, it's you again.
16
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,060
To think you'd transform into Kurenai
with a Transformation Jutsu.
17
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,970
Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
18
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,540
Shut up! For your sake,
don't be nosing around needlessly.
19
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,880
Hey!
20
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,550
You're Yakumo. Right?
21
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,550
I want to ask you something
about Kurenai Sensei!
22
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,790
D-Damn it!
23
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,610
This is…the Academy's hallway.
24
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,050
Sensei, please!
25
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,000
Yakumo's Sealed Power
26
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,340
Why am I no good?!
27
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,270
Kurenai Sensei?
28
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,680
I want to become a Ninja,
no matter what!
29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
I must become one!
30
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,210
I told you to give up.
31
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,550
No!
32
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,650
Then I’ll just have to perform
a Sealing Jutsu
33
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,550
and seal your power.
34
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,260
Huh?
35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,260
Huh?!
36
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,090
Kurenai Sensei!
37
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,560
Why?!
38
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,510
S-Sakura. Umm, where am I?!
39
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,250
As for me,
what am I doing lying here?!
40
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,320
Oh yeah! Kurenai Sensei
got stabbed
41
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,360
and my heart leapt out
of my chest and…
42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,560
No, that’s not it.
Where’s that girl?
43
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,930
Where’s Yakumo?
44
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,570
It seems you don’t remember at all.
45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,530
You got caught breaking
into a mountain cottage
46
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,070
under special security!
47
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,540
Huh…?!
48
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,140
The Anbu Black Ops are in action,
49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,280
so you should be thankful
you’re alive!
50
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,550
Oh yeah!
51
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,680
The dream I just had…
lt was strangely real.
52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,420
No doubt it was the girl
in the mountain cottage!
53
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,560
What’re you blabbing about?!
54
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,560
I’ll inject you with a stimulant
if you don’t knock it off.
55
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,560
I can’t be doing stuff like this!
56
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,970
Hold it!
57
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,540
The medicine hasn’t worn off, yet!
58
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,550
Sensei! Kurenai Sensei!
59
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,350
Kurenai’s already gone out.
60
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,350
What?!
61
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,520
You’ve gone to the trouble
of getting up early.
62
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,920
So how about joining me for
an early-morning marathon?
63
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,430
This isn’t the time for that!
64
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,230
Morning marathons are great!
65
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,560
Marathons purge the sweat
and impurities built up
66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,730
in your body from a night of sleep.
67
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,770
More importantly,
where did Kurenai Sensei go?!
68
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,170
Come to think of it,
69
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,810
she said something about going
to visit someone…
70
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,710
Something about a student
71
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,210
she took care of in the past
being in poor health…
72
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,210
Huh? She went to see Yakumo!
73
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,720
Then at least join me for
some morning exercise!
74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
Morning exercise purges the sweat
and impurities built up
75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,220
in your body from a night of sleep…
76
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,600
Kurenai Sensei!
77
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,300
Whoa?!
78
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,310
I have something I want to ask you,
Kurenai Sensei.
79
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,550
Naruto, don’t stick your nose
into my business any further.
80
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,020
Yesterday I went to see Yakumo!
81
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,250
I don’t know if it was
on account of that,
82
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,760
but I just had a strangely real dream!
83
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,820
A dream…?
84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,630
Yeah.
85
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,400
You said to Yakumo that you were
going to use a Sealing Jutsu
86
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,430
if she wouldn’t give up
becoming a Ninja…
87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,340
Sorry, but I’m in a hurry…
88
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,800
H-Hey. Wait!
89
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,540
It doesn’t concern you…
90
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,010
Yes, it does!
91
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,180
Hinata, Kiba and Shino are
all troubled
92
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,750
because you said you were
going to quit!
93
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,150
Doesn’t the fact that
you’re quitting Squad Eight
94
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,560
have something to do with
that girl Yakumo?!
95
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,900
What you saw wasn’t just a dream…
96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,930
What…?!
97
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,970
I used a Sealing Jutsu and
took away a student’s power!
98
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,610
No way. That couldn’t be!
99
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,550
It happened over a year ago…
100
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,720
By my own hand,
I crushed the dream of a girl…
101
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,860
I tutored individually named Yakumo…
102
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,030
who was trying to become
a practitioner of Genjutsu.
103
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,690
No way!
104
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,000
I don’t deserve to have
the lives of the Genin
105
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,130
in Squad Eight entrusted to me.
106
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,640
But why…?
107
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,440
Now, get out of my way!
108
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,540
That’s the end of this conversation.
109
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,710
No way…
But I still have stuff I want to ask you…!
110
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,250
I have no choice.
111
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,530
What's happening?!
112
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,840
They won’t come off!
113
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,310
Kurenai Sensei, that’s just cruel!
114
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,390
We’re already surrounded…
115
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
Make emergency contact
with the village…
116
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,090
Yes, sir.
117
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,630
There!
118
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,620
What?!
119
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,760
We’re counting on you!
120
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,570
What?!
121
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Hurry…to the Hokage!
122
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,560
Yakumo… Come with us.
123
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,550
Geez, that Naruto.
124
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,690
The least he could do is thank me
for attending to him all night.
125
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,560
What?!
126
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,540
Isn’t it about tea time?
127
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,750
After you’ve taken care of
these documents!
128
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,620
Why’s there so much work?
129
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,550
It’s because you didn’t take care
of it lickety-split, Lady Tsunade.
130
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
It’s a carrier pigeon for
emergency contacts!
131
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
What?!
132
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,230
It’s from the mountain cottage
in Satomi Hill…
133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,670
Something’s happened to Yakumo!
134
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,750
There’s a possibility that
a person being protected
135
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,960
by the Village Hidden in Leaves,
Yakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped.
136
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,060
Head for the mountain cottage in
Satomi Hill and secure Yakumo.
137
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,930
Yakumo Kurama…
138
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,540
As I recall, that’s the girl Kurenai
took custody of, right?
139
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,540
Yes, the only daughter of Murakumo
of the Kurama Clan head family.
140
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,640
Umm, what’s the Kurama Clan?
141
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,410
It’s natural that you guys wouldn’t know.
142
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,880
They were a distinguished family
143
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,890
that wielded considerable power
in the village,
144
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
but they’re just a shadow
of what they used to be.
145
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,760
The death of Murakumo
and his wife about a year ago
146
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,860
became the catalyst for that.
147
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,360
I hear that the clan fell apart
after that.
148
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,400
Does the kidnapping of the only
daughter of the head family mean
149
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,540
that the Kurama Clan’s
Secret Jutsu is being targeted?
150
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,010
Well…
151
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,440
According to the documents
152
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,980
handed down from
the Third Hokage,
153
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,350
it seems her latent powers as
a Genjutsu Ninja
154
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,320
are extremely dangerous…
155
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,660
In other words, she would make
for a powerful asset
156
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,820
if those powers can be awakened.
157
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,730
That means it wouldn’t
be surprising
158
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
if there were guys seeking
that power, huh?
159
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,560
After her parents died,
160
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,470
she was kept under
protective custody in the village.
161
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,540
All right. Leave it to me!
162
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,140
I won’t allow a girl to cry!
163
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,140
Might Guy,
the Leaf Village's Handsome Devil
164
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,240
will rescue her,
no matter what!
165
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,550
Sakura, you go with them as well.
166
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,650
– What?! 					– Huh?
167
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,550
Once we have her in custody,
168
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,550
we’ll need someone to look
after her condition.
169
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,090
Only one with experience as
a Medical Ninja can do this.
170
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,890
Y-Yes ma’am!
171
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,800
This mission is a chance
to show my master
172
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,100
the fruits of my training!
173
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,070
Ouch!
174
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,340
Ouch? Did you trip on a tree root
or something?
175
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,810
What’s this?!
176
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,390
N-Naruto…!
177
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,860
He fell asleep in a place like this?!
178
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,570
Nice, Akamaru!
179
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,970
Naruto…
180
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,550
He’s…caught in a Genjutsu!
181
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,150
– Huh? 					– Huh?
182
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,090
Release!
183
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,500
What…? Sakura…
184
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,540
Salty!
185
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:35,210
What the hell is this?!
I mean, was I asleep again?
186
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,850
What’re you babbling about?!
187
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,980
You were caught in a Genjutsu.
188
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,550
Genjutsu…
189
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,360
I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei
190
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,530
who was heading for
the Satomi mountain cottage
191
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,430
and I tried to get her to listen to me.
192
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,230
Satomi mountain cottage,
you say?
193
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,570
Then Kurenai went alone?
194
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,140
Yeah, probably.
195
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,140
Kurenai’s in danger
196
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,570
if she went without being aware
what’s happening!
197
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Huh?
198
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,050
Something’s strange…
199
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,560
Someone’s here!
200
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Damn it. Was it a mistake
to come alone…?
201
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,870
But I don’t have the time
to return to the village…
202
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,540
They’re most likely after…Yakumo.
203
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,540
What?!
204
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,380
Oh no!
205
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,910
Sorry, but I mustn’t allow you
to interfere with our work.
206
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,780
Wha--?!
207
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,510
You think you caught me with that?
208
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,420
What?!
209
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,550
You’re the one who’s caught!
210
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,690
The enemies are also practitioners
of Genjutsu.
211
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,230
I must not lose…
212
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,570
What’s this presence?!
213
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,840
They’re both caught in a Genjutsu.
214
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,020
Yakumo… Is that you, Yakumo?
215
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,170
So you were safe!
216
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,040
Help me!
217
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,420
It’s okay now, Yakumo.
218
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,650
I’ll protect you, no matter what.
219
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,390
Kurenai Sensei!
220
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,540
Release!
221
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
You were hit with
a reverse Genjutsu, eh?
222
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,590
I-I’m sorry.
223
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,560
Just what I’d expect from
a Jonin…
224
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,830
No, I should probably say Kurenai Yuhi…
225
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,900
Stay alert!
226
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,960
We should consider ourselves
227
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
as being under suspicion
by the Leaf Village.
228
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,330
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
229
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,140
The two who took Yakumo
haven’t returned…
230
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,450
I guess somewhat violent action
can’t be avoided.
231
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,350
Although we come from
the same village…
232
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,550
we will get Yakumo,
no matter what the cost.
233
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,550
Understood?
234
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,550
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
235
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh!
236
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,560
What is it, Hinata?!
237
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,930
Did you see something?
238
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,170
The mountain cottage is
being attacked by someone.
239
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,540
There are four out front and four inside
the mountain cottage.
240
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,010
Are two of the people inside
the mountain cottage
241
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,270
Kurenai and Yakumo?
242
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,710
I bet that’s it!
243
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,950
Kurenai Sensei,
what the hell happened?!
244
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,750
Tell us!
245
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,260
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
246
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,570
Will always be smiling right near by
247
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,440
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
248
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,950
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
249
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,850
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
250
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,690
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
251
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,630
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
252
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,000
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
253
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
254
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,840
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
255
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
The wind is probably testing our hearts
256
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,050
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
257
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,220
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
258
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,060
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
259
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,670
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
260
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,840
Will always be smiling right near by
261
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,610
I’m surprised…
262
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,650
Who would’ve thought that
263
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,390
the intruders would turn out
to be you people.
264
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,160
But whatever reasons you may have,
I won’t let you take Yakumo!
265
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,560
The Third Hokage entrusted
this child to me.
266
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,230
Even if you are experts in Genjutsu,
267
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,670
I will protect this child with
every ounce of strength I have in my body.
268
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,770
Next time: “Kurenai's Top-Secret Mission:
The Promise with the Third Hokage”
//%
1
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:21,550
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,300
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,850
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,590
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,100
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,970
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:55,430
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:06,220
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:15,590
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,720
What were you gazing at?
10.01	01:51:41:26	01:51:45:16	                       When Time Stands Still
11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,390
As long as the score isn’t settled,
12
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,390
the clock inside my heart will
remain stopped in the past!
13
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,590
Lord Sagi, if you live
for revenge,
14
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,430
your heart will sink
into darkness!
15
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,890
If it means that I am able
to carry out my revenge…
16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
I don’t care if my heart sinks
into darkness!
17
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,590
That’s exactly right.
18
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,050
I hold a grudge against you,
I hate you…
19
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,050
My only purpose in living
has been to kill you…
20
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,640
Sasuke!
21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,640
I've…
22
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,350
I’ve survived!
23
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,390
I’m finished with messing around
with you Leaf Village guys.
24
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,300
I will go to Orochimaru!
25
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,930
I can’t…let you go there…
26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,260
I cannot allow…!
27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,430
you to go there!
28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,590
I wasn’t able to stop a comrade
who was sinking into darkness…
29
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,720
However, I won’t let you go there,
no matter what!
30
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,970
You pesky little…
31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,930
If you get in my way,
I’ll consider you an enemy too!
32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,260
There’s no way you guys…
could ever understand!
33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,590
It’s a trick device!
34
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,590
No one can hinder my desire!
35
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,430
What was that?!
36
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,890
It’s no good!
37
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,590
We can’t get out!
38
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,140
Farewell! Ninja of the Village Hidden
in the Leaves!
39
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,050
Lightning Blade!
40
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,140
There!
41
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,350
How did you figure it out…?!
42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,100
Because I’ve seen your Jutsu
with these very eyes…
43
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,970
I remember now… 					You are…
44
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,970
Hatake…Kakashi…
45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,590
The Copy Ninja with
the Sharingan…
46
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,100
Your Jutsu doesn’t even faintly mirror
that of Gaara’s…
47
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,890
You’ve only scratched its surface…
48
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,590
All you’re doing is leaving
your main body elsewhere
49
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,140
and using your Chakra to manipulate
the rocks and sand…
50
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,470
We are nomads…
51
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,850
ridiculed as lower-ranked Shinobi
without a village…
52
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,930
That’s why we travel around the country,
stealing Jutsu, sharpening our skills,
53
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,590
struggling to one day find our way
into a place in the sun.
54
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,590
But no matter how dedicated
our efforts are…
55
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,390
to think there are dimensions
that cannot be transgressed…
56
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,300
That’s the direction of
the Feudal Lord’s palace…
57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,760
Hurry up! Lord Sagi’s thought
to be buried beneath there!
58
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,390
Damn it!
We really got screwed…
59
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,550
That jerk!
60
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,260
What a jerk… Gimme a break!
61
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,930
What happened…
62
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,680
Huh?
63
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,600
Kakashi Sensei!
64
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,720
Sagi totally squashed us just now
and went off somewhere!
65
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,930
Gimme a break…
that guy’s some kind of jerk!
66
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,590
Please don’t blame him for
the things he has done.
67
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,050
But…!
68
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,890
He is himself,
but not himself right now.
69
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,470
Huh? What do you mean?
70
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,590
He is obsessed with avenging
71
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,550
his father and
younger sister’s deaths.
72
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,050
I believe he is possessed
by the ghost of the late Lord Owashi.
73
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh come on… Stop joking…
74
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,140
That’s not necessarily a joke.
75
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,640
Stop it! That kind of thing gives me
the creeps!
76
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,590
Get a grip! This isn’t the time to be
squabbling over things like that!
77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,470
What’s important right now
is to find Sagi!
78
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,430
But we have no idea
where he went.
79
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,390
If he is possessed,
80
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,760
it is certain that
he will return to take revenge…
81
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,590
And moreover…very soon…
82
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,590
Elder Brother…lf I were to lose you too,
after having lost our father…
83
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,590
I could not go on living…
84
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,680
Father…Elder Brother…
85
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,680
I shall join with you…
86
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,470
Elder Brother!
87
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,590
Elder Brother…
I will avenge this without fail…
88
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,590
I will once more restart
the hands of time for you, Elder Brother,
89
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,050
whose time was brought to a standstill…
90
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,590
Until the day that wish is realized…
91
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,590
I will live as you, Elder Brother,
as Sagi!
92
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,260
Sagi’s temperament is such that
he will undoubtedly come here for Moso.
93
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,430
It’s actually quite convenient
94
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,010
that Lord Sagi comes
all the way here to see me…
95
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,390
Even if I can’t get my hands
on Sagi, the Feudal Lord,
96
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,590
it’s not a crime to kill him
as the Cursed Warrior.
97
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,600
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
98
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,470
What a joke… A ghost appearing
in a child’s toy…
99
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,680
You have some nerve appearing here
like this…
100
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,180
Cursed Warrior…
101
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,390
Lord Sagi…
102
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,260
Huh…who are you…?
103
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,850
Aren’t you the high and mighty Moso?
104
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,800
I won't answer to words like that
105
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,430
from the likes of a ghost.
106
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,260
Damn you!
107
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,510
That’s right…
108
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,100
Moso is just a fictitious name
used to deceive the world…
109
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,260
My name is Hoki…
110
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,260
The Leader who heads
the Wandering Ninja…
111
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,970
In place of not having a village,
we the Wandering Ninja
112
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,010
steal Jutsu from every village
we pass through and make them our own!
113
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,010
But our family has tired of living
for so long as nomads.
114
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,220
And we have been searching
for a Land to call our home.
115
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,140
I see…
116
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,470
From the very start,
117
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,590
you came here to the Land of Bird
with the intention of taking it over!
118
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,590
There’s no way that
somebody like you,
119
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,430
who was born destined to become
a feudal lord…
120
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,140
could understand
the suffering of Wandering Ninja
121
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,720
who do not have a homeland!
122
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,600
I don’t see a problem…
123
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,930
with the Wandering Ninja
seeking a safe homeland.
124
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,430
After all, your father was someone
who easily trusted others…
125
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,290
He never even suspected anything
126
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,100
when I switched with the monk Moso,
highly reputed for his virtue,
127
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,430
and neared him…
128
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,890
He misinterpreted
my Genjutsu of deception
129
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,350
as being the holy power
of the virtuous Moso
130
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,970
and put me on the fast track…
131
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,550
The only person who suspected me
was Komei.
132
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,180
I assassinated Owashi
and drove Komei away…
133
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,260
Y-You jerk…
so it was you, after all!
134
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,510
And the last step is to kill you, Sagi.
135
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,260
If I can do that, I will have accomplished
what I set out to do!
136
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,100
You jerk! I won’t forgive you!
137
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,100
Revenge for my clan!
138
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,600
You are…?!
139
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,260
Yes, that’s right!
140
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,350
My name is Toki!
141
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,760
Lady Toki…!
142
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,590
I will avenge my father
and brother’s death!
143
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,350
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
144
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,590
Look at that, Toki…
Our shadows are overlapping, right…
145
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,640
That’s the Shadow Possession Jutsu!
146
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,260
With this, you won’t be able
to move anymore!
147
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,930
But I wouldn’t have imagined that
you would be the younger sister Toki…
148
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,220
The Wandering Ninja will be successful
in taking control of this land.
149
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,760
You will die as Sagi just
as you desire!
150
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,010
Lady Toki! Keep your composure!
151
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,640
Chishima…
152
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,590
So you were alive, huh…
153
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,430
I was unaware of your feelings, Lady Toki.
154
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,260
Chishima is most ashamed!
155
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,720
Take this and die!
156
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,890
I overheard everything just now.
157
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,590
Sagi, I mean, Toki!
Leave the rest to me!
158
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,590
Naruto…?!
159
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,590
That’s not gonna happen!
You will die by your own shadow!
160
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,590
The shadow has nothing to do with it!
161
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,970
You’re just under the influence
of his Genjutsu!
162
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,850
What?!
163
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,430
Lady Toki…
164
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,390
Shadow Possession is
Shikamaru’s Clan's Secret Jutsu!
165
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,350
There’s no way you could
even hope to imitate it!
166
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,220
Not only is your identity fake,
but your Ninjutsu is too!
167
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,800
Who the hell are you?!
168
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,890
Naruto!
169
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,590
The heavens are watching your villainy!
170
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,220
There is no way we will forgive you!
171
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,890
Why you Leaf Ninja…
But it’s only a Clone Jutsu!
172
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,590
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
173
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,800
They have substances?!
174
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,590
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
175
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,430
Sasuke’s Phoenix Flower Jutsu
is much more awesome!
176
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,800
It’s my turn this time!
177
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,930
Damn you!
178
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,590
Kakashi Hatake…
179
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,590
So you’re here too, huh…
180
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,140
Hoki, the leader who heads
the Wandering Shinobi…huh…
181
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,890
I’ve heard rumors about you…
182
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,350
So you’re a Shinobi who wanders
from place to place like a bat…
183
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,600
Ninja from a rich village can’t possibly
imagine circumstances like ours…
184
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,680
Like hell I’ll understand it…
185
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,180
The Leaf are taught that the Way of Ninja
is to become a Ninja who can endure…
186
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,050
People like you who trick people
and wishfully try to seize land
187
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,220
have no right to call themselves Shinobi!
188
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,590
Elitist!
189
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,100
Summoning Jutsu!
190
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,300
Damn! That’s a real dragon!
191
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
No way!
192
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,140
Wait…!
193
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,050
Wait!
194
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,640
Over there, huh…
195
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,590
What’s up with that?
196
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,800
So the Summoning Dragons
were fake too …
197
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,590
He fled off somewhere…
198
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,510
Inside the mansion!
199
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,390
I’m not letting him get away!
200
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,590
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
201
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,260
Hey you…wait!
202
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,890
Where did he vanish to?!
203
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,680
Hey, Leaf Ninja…
204
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,430
Huh?!
205
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,720
Wh-What?!
206
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,430
If you want to have Toki back,
come over here…
207
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,100
H-How?!
208
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,140
Take that boat to come over here…
209
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,180
Genjutsu?
210
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,590
Are you scared,
you Leaf apprentice Ninja?
211
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,050
I’m not an apprentice!
212
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,550
This place…don’t tell me it’s…
213
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,220
What’s that?
214
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,300
The wind blows, Ah…
215
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,050
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
216
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,590
What should be brought along?
217
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,590
Assemble them into a piece.
218
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,640
There is no second chance, never
219
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,350
How foolish it is to throw away
220
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
221
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,510
The images.
222
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,590
It probably will not end
223
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,850
It probably will not end
224
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,600
Burn that love-filled heart,
225
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,680
Sail across a thousand dreams
226
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,720
Running freely
227
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,510
To take hold of the world in hand
228
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,590
The clouds scatter
229
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,590
The sun sets yet again
230
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,100
The solo parade begins to move.
231
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,430
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
232
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,800
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
233
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,850
Chishima…
234
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,470
believed in you
until the very end.
235
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,590
He truly loved this land…
236
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,800
and he worried about his friends
from the bottom of his heart!
237
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,680
And yet…
238
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,100
And yet…!
239
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,350
I won't forgive you, you bastard!
240
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm gonna beat the hell outta you!
241
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,050
Next time:
"When Egrets Flap Their Wings"
//%
1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,010
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,470
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,680
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,180
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,100
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,430
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,100
Plea from a Friend
21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,590
That's Naruto?
22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,510
What is this intimidating power?
23
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,470
And what was that
red Chakra earlier on?
24
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,350
Is this guy a monster?
25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,800
What the heck are you?!
26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,590
Your friend!
27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,720
That’s why I’m telling you
28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,510
I’m not gonna let the likes
of Orochimaru get you!
29
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,590
I’m telling you that I’ll stop you…
30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,300
even if it means breaking
every bone in your arm and legs!
31
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,590
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!
32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,550
Come on! Wake up, already!
33
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,470
If you don’t come to your senses,
I'll have to break your bones
34
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,890
so that you can’t move
and I'll take you home that way, Sasuke!
35
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,850
Shut up…
36
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,930
What the heck do you,
37
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,600
who has neither parents nor brothers,
think you understand?
38
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,850
What makes you think that you,
who's been all alone from the start,
39
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,100
can understand anything about me?!
40
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,510
It’s because I have the ties
that I feel this agony.
41
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,590
How could you possibly understand…
42
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,180
what it feels like to lose all that!
43
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,590
It’s true that I can’t understand…
44
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,010
how it feels to really
have parents or brothers…
45
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,550
However…
46
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,430
It’s my treat today…
Eat your fill!
47
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,220
Yippee!
48
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,220
When I’m with Iruka Sensei,
I imagine…
49
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,970
– Dig in! 					– Dig in!
50
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,970
Ninja, first of all, need to
warm their inner man.
51
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,590
Hey! Hey! Don’t get too carried away
and overeat!
52
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,470
If this is…
what it feels like to have a dad.
53
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,680
When I’m with you…
54
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,720
Idiot, idiot, idiot…
55
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,050
What was that, you loser?!
56
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,220
I’m not gonna lose to you,
no matter what!
57
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,760
Go ahead and say
whatever you want.
58
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,590
How about this?
59
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,590
Better not start feeling
too comfortable.
60
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,180
I wonder…if having a brother
feels something like that.
61
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,220
Why is it, Naruto…?
62
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,930
Why is it that you go to
this extent for me…?
63
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,720
For me it’s a tie that
I’ve finally been able to have!
64
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,720
That’s why I’m gonna stop you.
65
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:14,590
It’s too late, Naruto…
lt’s already too late.
66
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,350
I can’t go back anymore.
67
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,470
Come, Naruto!
68
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,800
In that case,
I just have to cut that tie.
69
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,180
Cut, huh?
70
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,590
Then why wear that headband now?
71
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,430
I’ll acknowledge you…
You’re strong.
72
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,590
And the reason for that is
73
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,590
you’re someone who knows
the pain of solitude as I do.
74
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,930
And that pain makes people stronger.
75
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,590
And for that very reason,
by cutting that tie,
76
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,470
I will be able to obtain
even greater strength.
77
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,590
I will fight you now on equal terms.
However…
78
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,760
You won't even be able to
inflict a scratch on my forehead.
79
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,050
That’s something that
won’t change in the least.
80
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,300
It seems that whatever I say
won’t have any effect anymore, huh?
81
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,300
Sasuke!
82
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,600
I’m done with talking…
83
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,050
From here on, it’s only fighting.
84
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,890
Come!
85
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,590
I’m able to see…
86
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,590
I’m now able to see
this guy’s movements…
87
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,720
which I wasn’t able to see before.
88
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,590
I’m able to see them!
89
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,220
Sasuke’s moving completely
different from a few moments ago.
90
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,050
But I couldn’t care less!
91
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,100
In any case, I can’t afford to lose!
92
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,590
Damn it!
93
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,140
It must be the influence of my body
getting used to the state of Curse Mark.
94
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,590
When he moves…
95
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,680
by the subtle movements in
the way he exerts his strength…
96
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,050
I can vividly see
an image of his next move.
97
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,890
With my level of “eyes,”
98
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,800
I don’t need to use unnecessary Chakra
and can instead preserve it.
99
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,970
The Curse Mark takes
too much Chakra.
100
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,590
If I can see this much…
101
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:38,350
I can time my attacks to the images of
Naruto’s movements as I foresee them.
102
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,140
This is no good…
103
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,430
He’s totally reading my movements.
104
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,760
Damn it!
105
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,970
Oh, there you are.
106
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,590
There’s no mistake it’s this way, right?
107
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,390
Right.
108
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,550
We better hurry.
I have a bad premonition.
109
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,850
Sasuke!
110
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,930
Fire Style:
Dragon Flame Jutsu!
111
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,220
Sa-su-ke…
112
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,590
It’s too late, Naruto.
113
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,890
It’s too late now! Naruto!
114
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,220
You're weak, aren’t you, kid?
115
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,800
You better be grateful to me…
116
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,300
and to the Fourth Hokage
117
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,930
who contained me within
the likes of you!
118
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,720
What’s going on?
119
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,350
What was that just now?
120
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,970
Even if I’m able to read
Naruto’s movements completely…
121
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,640
his Chakra makes
a separate move of its own.
122
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,850
It seems like the Chakra itself is moving
in accordance with its own will…
123
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,050
Even with my “eyes”
I’m unable to read it completely.
124
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,680
That red Chakra…
that’s not an ordinary Chakra!
125
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,100
Your target is Naruto, after all.
126
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,640
To abduct Naruto
is the No.1 priority
127
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,050
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
128
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,850
I see…
129
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,590
It appears that you have
some kind of special power.
130
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,590
Now I understand!
131
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,590
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!
132
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,050
That Chakra is protecting him?!
133
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,180
Calm down.
134
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,470
I won’t be caught as long as
I fight from distance.
135
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,050
Damn it… This is incredible!
136
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,590
All I can do is dodge…
137
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,300
Please let me get there in time.
138
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,300
Damn it, gimme a break…
139
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,680
If I get tainted by this power …
140
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,430
I don’t even know what
will happen to me in the end…
141
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,550
But, it can’t be helped,
can it, Naruto?
142
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,590
It is certainly true
that you were special…
143
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,930
However…
144
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,010
I am even more special than you.
145
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,350
Sasuke!
146
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,430
When I recalled the parts one by one,
147
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,640
I felt as though
I had understood everything
148
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:44,350
Faded words which I kept so close to me
149
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:54,050
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
150
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,800
and this distant yearning for you
151
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:10,180
I live, simply repeating this cycle
152
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:21,800
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
153
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:32,350
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
154
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,010
I’ll keep these thoughts…
155
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,140
Damn! My body hurts!
156
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,100
And to make it worse,
157
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,260
I’ve completely lost feeling
in my left arm!
158
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,590
Apparently this power
isn’t something that
159
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,800
I can just keep on using continuously!
160
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,470
But …I can’t give up!
161
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,720
My next blow is
going to be the end!
162
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,800
Next episode: “The End of Tears”
//%
1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,580
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:29,490
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,790
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,950
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,120
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,660
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,540
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:04,580
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,830
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,500
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:28,490
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,620
That form…?!
13
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,580
So that’s the extent of
the rumored “Absolute Defense”?
14
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,700
How disappointing.
15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,370
I see… You were wearing sand, eh?
16
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,620
Your opponent’s not just him!
17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,450
I’m here, too!
18
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,790
Th-That attack just now…
19
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,160
It would’ve been dangerous
had I not been protected by sand.
20
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,950
M-My body is still…
21
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,490
I’ll just be a hindrance like this.
22
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,370
Annoying sand…
23
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,000
You’re first, Gaara.
24
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,410
He yanked out his spinal column?!
25
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,870
Vengeful Strike:
The Bracken Dance
26
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,950
Dance of the Clematis Flower.
27
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,120
Vine!
28
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,580
Flower!
29
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,080
A bone of the strongest calcification…
30
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,120
It will pierce you,
sand defense and all…
31
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,950
No time…huh?
32
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,580
Ultimate Defense: Shukaku’s Shield!
33
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,620
Kabuto…
34
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,660
How much longer will
Kimimaro hold out for?
35
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,080
I think he should still
be okay for a while…
36
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,490
I did all I could with the treatment…
37
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,910
But there’s not nearly enough
information about his body.
38
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,950
I think it’d be quite different
if we had something
39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,540
like the medical history
and treatment data of his clan.
40
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,000
What came out after looking into it
41
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:44,910
was the bloody history of how
the Kaguya Clan became just him…
42
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,870
Fools who provoked the great land of
the Village Hidden in the Mist into battle
43
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,950
with just their clan
and were annihilated.
44
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,660
The Kaguya Clan was
a foolish clan that liked battle.
45
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,790
The battlefield was the only place
where they could be at peace.
46
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,490
But it was long ago when
a simple-minded group
47
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,250
that only enjoyed slaughter
was acceptable…
48
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,790
The times are different now.
49
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,200
Doing something like fighting
only with power
50
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,830
against a governed organization
like the Mist…
51
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,160
can only be called an act of fools
rushing towards death.
52
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,500
And then you saved only he
who was the youngest
53
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,790
and the most exceptional
among the Kaguya Clan…
54
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,490
That kid possessed the power that
would be feared even by the fighting clan.
55
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,700
So it seems he was kept
in prison the whole time.
56
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,490
It would’ve been a waste to let him…die.
57
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,490
Who wouldn’t want
that rare Kekkei Genkai?
58
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,870
He possesses a strong
and firm bone structure
59
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,490
and a defensive power to
repel all kinds of physical attacks.
60
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,250
And if turned to offense…
61
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,660
the bones become
a most powerful weapon.
62
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,580
It’s because I’ve fought him once
that I understand this.
63
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,000
That sand shield is
an absolute defense, no less.
64
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,790
And that unusual form…
65
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,160
It’ll be okay.
There’s no way it’ll be broken!
66
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
It’s hard…
67
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,490
I gathered minerals with
great hardness from the ground,
68
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,490
applied pressure with Chakra
and mixed them into the sand.
69
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,250
You… that unusual Jutsu…
70
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,490
It’s the Kekkei Genkai, right?
71
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,120
The Kaguya Clan…
72
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,660
The ability which now
only I possess.
73
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,330
The last one of the clan, eh?
74
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,700
Then it’ll die out here today.
75
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,580
Indeed, that might happen.
76
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Due to sickness,
my body will not last so long…
77
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,620
But, the clan will not die out.
78
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,620
Besides I’m not alone.
79
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,620
This is the “Earth” Curse Mark…
80
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,410
With this…
81
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,830
I can become a part of you,
Lord Orochimaru.
82
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,370
Let’s get everything, Kimimaro.
83
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,660
And let’s see the truth of
this world together.
84
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,540
Yes.
85
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,950
You’re my “Vessel of Dreams.”
86
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,540
I’m counting on you.
87
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,620
They are presents from me.
I hope you like them.
88
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,250
Would you rather…die or obey?
89
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,040
Obey…
90
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,540
You will!
91
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,080
Is this the best a team
of four can do?
92
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,660
I’ll ask just once more…
93
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,200
Which would you rather choose?
94
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,450
Very well…
95
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,290
As of now, we’re the Sound Ninja Five.
96
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,750
Not alone, you said…?
97
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,870
That’s right…
98
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,870
As an existence shouldering
one part of Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…
99
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,660
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru’s soul…
100
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,870
for all eternity.
101
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,620
Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?
102
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,580
You’re a pitiful guy.
103
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,450
I used my big moves too much.
I don’t have much Chakra.
104
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,160
This is the last of it.
105
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,870
What an amount of Chakra…
106
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,120
You are something…
107
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,160
I’ll sink and confine you
200 meters into the ground.
108
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,660
By the pressure of the sand
stuck to your body,
109
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,500
you’ll soon be unable to move,
not even a finger…
110
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,490
You did it…!
This time for sure you did it.
111
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,160
Dance…
112
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,120
Bracken Dance!
113
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,490
It is annoying…
114
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,490
It feels like a long time
115
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,750
when waiting eagerly for
something you want.
116
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,200
Kabuto…
117
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,000
Stop talking like
you’re humoring a child!
118
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,250
I’m sorry…
119
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,490
But you should know
this the most, Lord Orochimaru.
120
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,160
Nobody can beat Kimimaro,
121
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,620
no matter what hindrance
should appear.
122
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,000
Thanks for saving me…
123
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,830
Being able to do something like this;
very impressive.
124
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,080
All I did was ride the sand
I’m always controlling.
125
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,870
You just have to know how you use it.
126
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,870
Lord Orochimaru…
127
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,410
I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru…
128
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,540
At last… The destruction of
the Leaf will begin…
129
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,700
Third Hokage…
I’ll teach you a thing or two.
130
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,700
Sorry to keep you waiting.
131
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,080
What’s the matter, Kimimaro?
132
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,910
No… It’s nothing.
133
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,580
Even the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand Village
134
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,330
is no match against us.
135
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,410
Of course…
136
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,160
Kimimaro, it’s thanks to you…
137
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,490
Kimimaro!
138
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,000
Kimimaro, so you can’t go on, huh?
139
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,490
I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru.
140
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,160
If I can’t be of use…
141
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,950
then there’s no significance
to my living.
142
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,080
How is your condition, Kimimaro?
143
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,490
The “Destruction of the Leaf”
resulted in an unfortunate near-miss.
144
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,160
But the Sound Ninja Four
have gone to pick up a new vessel…
145
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,750
Lord Orochimaru’s new
“Vessel of Dreams.”
146
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,830
Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?
147
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,870
You’re a pitiful guy…
148
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,700
You’re wrong… Far from it!
149
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,540
There’s no significance to living…
150
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,580
But…you might be able to discover
something interesting
151
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,580
by continuing to live…
152
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,490
Like how you discovered that flower…
153
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,500
Like how I discovered you.
154
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,660
This is the “Earth” Curse Mark!
155
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,290
With this… I can become
a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.
156
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,490
Let’s get everything, Kimimaro…
157
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,490
And let’s see the truth of
this world together.
158
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,790
I’m going to discover
the truth of this world!
159
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,410
With Lord Orochimaru!
160
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,490
He was a persistent guy,
but this is the end.
161
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,790
He won’t ever come out again.
162
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,830
R-Right…
163
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,950
I can’t go on…
164
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,200
We’re getting off…
165
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,910
It’s not brainwashing!
166
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,700
That person…
Lord Orochimaru understands me!
167
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,750
What do you guys know?!
168
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,040
He’s dead…
169
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,200
Could it be? Has Kimimaro…?
170
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,200
The likes of Kimimaro makes
no difference now…
171
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,490
Sasuke… I can hardly wait for him.
172
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,490
He’ll come here even by himself…
173
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,410
I would have been totally hammered.
174
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,490
That’s not the case.
175
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,490
My sensei said it often…
176
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,160
Luck is also a part of strength.
177
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,700
That backseat driver?
178
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,910
He’s not a backseat driver!
179
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,620
It’s because…
180
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,910
I wasn’t good enough at that time!
181
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,490
I’m grateful for you saving me.
182
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,490
But please don’t talk like that
about my sensei!
183
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,500
You, too…?
184
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,410
When you feel that
185
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,120
the honor of someone you revere
has been hurt,
186
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,830
you yourself are hurt badly
and become enraged.
187
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,870
The more important the person
you revere is to you,
188
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,370
the greater the feeling…
189
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,620
The clan won’t die out…
I’m not alone.
190
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,200
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru’s soul for all eternity.
191
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,000
That person,
Lord Orochimaru, understands me!
192
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,160
What do you guys know?!
193
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,290
Fighting for the sake of someone
important to you…
194
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,450
He was also the same
as Naruto Uzumaki…
195
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,490
But…the person who is important
to oneself
196
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,000
might not always be “virtuous.”
197
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,450
I wonder…
198
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,580
There’s no way someone evil
can be thought of as an important person.
199
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,790
No. Even if you know they’re “evil”…
200
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,250
People can’t defeat solitude…
201
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,160
Sasuke!
202
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,750
For the first time, I spoke to you
203
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,870
And you smiled
204
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,490
For the first time, I was able to speak
205
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,290
In my own words
206
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,830
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
207
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,490
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
208
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,080
My clumsy attempts with words
209
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,750
You listened without turning away
210
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,040
No wonder I get carried away by you
211
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:11,120
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
212
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,370
I feel so sad
213
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,330
But…
214
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,660
For the first time, I spoke to you
215
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,700
And you smiled
216
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,490
For the first time, I was able to speak
217
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,490
In my own words
218
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,080
For the first time, I spoke to you
219
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,330
And you smiled
220
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,750
For the first time, I was able to speak
221
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,700
In my own words
222
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,490
For the first time, I spoke to you
223
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,200
You gotta be kidding me!
224
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,490
What do you mean
“for achieving your goal”?!
225
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,870
Orochimaru wants you
only as a “vessel”!
226
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,750
There’s no way
I can let you go to him!
227
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,410
This is no joke!
228
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:11,580
If you insist on going,
I have to take you back by force!
229
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,120
Next episode: “A Cry on Deaf Ears”
//%
1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,690
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,450
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,990
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,690
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,240
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:46,110
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:55,570
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:06,360
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:15,700
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,860
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,820
Ah, which way is it?!
12
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,150
There’s a faint scent of salt water…
13
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,450
We were almost there…
14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,610
Then I’ll use
my Rasengan to…
15
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,900
Wait! If it doesn’t go well,
we’ll be crushed under the ceiling.
16
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,690
If so, what should we do?!
17
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,900
Everyone, step backward.
18
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,360
What?!
19
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,110
Phew, we’re safe…!
20
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,530
Anko Sensei!
21
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,490
Let’s get moving…
lt’s already morning.
22
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,900
Oh no!
23
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,950
The ships collecting funds
are in danger…!
24
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,400
We’ve got to follow them
right away!
25
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,030
With that ship!
26
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay, let’s go!
27
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,690
You’ve had no contact
from the Ninja of the Leaf Village?
28
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,610
They were told to
accompany the ship.
29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,740
What in the world happened?
30
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,650
Captain, we just received
communication.
31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
I see!
32
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,320
That’s what I expect
from elite Ninja!
33
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,990
It seems they finished
34
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,700
the suppression of
the Demon of the Ocean last night.
35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,280
– Oh… 					– Oh!
36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,860
Excellent…
So now the ships are safe.
37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,400
Of course.
Men, take your positions!
38
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,950
We’ll depart.
39
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,070
Despair: A Fractured Heart
40
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,690
Be careful of the reef!
41
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,690
I don’t see any ships that look like
those that collect funds in the port.
42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,950
How could they depart without us?
43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,070
Have they already fallen
into Amachi’s scheme…?
44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,530
C-Captain Hitode…
45
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,030
What happened?!
46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,610
There’s something there!
The bottom of the ship…!
47
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,690
Confirm the enemy!
48
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,690
R-Roger!
49
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,820
Huh? What?
50
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,360
Full toward port!
51
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,030
I can’t steer!
52
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,360
What?
53
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,740
It’s no good. It won’t move.
54
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,150
We’re going to hit, everyone.
Grab onto something!
55
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,360
This must be the attack from
the Demon of the Ocean?
56
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,400
Thank you for working hard
for transporting the funds.
57
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,690
I saw you while ago!
58
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,150
Identify yourself!
59
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,110
If you hand this ship over
without resistance,
60
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,900
I will save your life.
61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
Don’t mess with me!
62
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,860
– It’s the Demon of the Ocean…
– A monster!
63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,490
Demon Illusion: Fire Jutsu.
64
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,780
Wh-What…?
65
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,240
Th-That’s…
66
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,650
It’s fire torture…!
67
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,110
Yoroi, take care of the rest.
68
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,570
What?!
69
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,650
I’m your opponent!
70
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,450
Everyone, hang in there!
71
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,740
Don’t be so nasty!
72
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,110
We meet again, weirdo!
73
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,200
Excuse me, but I still have
something to ask you.
74
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,780
What are you doing, Isaribi!
75
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,690
Cut it out already!
76
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,690
Keep this up and you’ll really turn
into the Demon of the Ocean!
77
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,150
Do it, Isaribi.
78
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,360
Your opponent is right here.
79
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,650
You said that Orochimaru left
80
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,650
that research facility
half a month ago…
81
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,360
Where did he go?
82
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,950
I don’t know…
83
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,900
Now that you mention it,
Orochimaru had a kid in tow.
84
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,690
I heard that the kid is
really excellent, unlike you.
85
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,200
Sasuke Uchiha.
86
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,150
Something about you
just wasn’t enough.
87
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,070
That’s why you were abandoned,
I guess.
88
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,690
Isarirbi?!
89
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,070
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
90
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,530
Isaribi…
91
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,690
I bet you still understand
what I’ve been saying to you, Isaribi!
92
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,070
Don’t you care a bit after
tormenting everyone this much?
93
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,690
No.
94
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,490
I think nothing of…
even bringing you down…
95
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,690
That’s a lie!
96
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,150
It doesn’t matter to me
who gets injured…
97
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,610
or who drowns…
98
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,070
I’m satisfied as long as
I can return to being a human!
99
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,990
It’s about time to come
to yourself!
100
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,900
I understand painfully
enough how you feel…
101
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,700
But…doing that…
lt’s not good!
102
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,950
Isaribi, you saved me.
You have a kind heart!
103
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,240
Pretty good for a Medical Ninja.
104
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Shut up!
105
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,950
I’m a little surprised that
106
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,490
you had enough time
to take your eyes off…
107
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,070
D-Damn it!
108
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,110
You’re too confident…
109
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,070
You’re useless.
110
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,530
How long you think
you’ll be doing this?
111
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,490
Amachi…
112
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,860
He’s just a kid.
113
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,110
Why can’t you finish him off
right away?
114
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,690
Sorry. But…
115
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,690
I can’t take it anymore.
Get out of my way!
116
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,030
Bring it on.
I’ll kill a damn monster like you!
117
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,690
Monster? Me?
118
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,070
That’s right!
119
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,860
You so easily injure
and kill people.
120
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,690
You’re a monster wearing
human skin!
121
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,900
Hey! What’s so funny!
122
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,690
If so, what then?
123
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,490
I’m not some half-monster
like Isaribi…
124
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,860
I’m…
125
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,240
further refined than her and
fully integrated for combat use!
126
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,490
You…!
127
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,240
Amachi…!
128
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,690
Get out of my way!
129
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,490
You’re an almost-dead guinea pig…
130
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,780
What are you doing?!
131
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,950
Even though we were supposed to dissect
and use her as material for experiments,
132
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,690
we took pity on her and
kept her alive.
133
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,690
But after all,
she’s terribly ungrateful and useless.
134
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,530
What’s wrong…kid?
135
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,860
You! You’re not only
a monster in body and soul!
136
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,240
In truth, you’re scum!
137
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,400
C’mere… I’ll play with you.
138
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,860
Bastard!
139
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,820
Idiot!
140
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,320
Hah, amateurish…
141
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,450
Not over yet!
142
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,780
Shadow Clone Jutsu
143
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,280
No matter how many times
you come at me,
144
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,280
you’ll get the same thing!
145
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,610
Well, what’s wrong, little guy?
146
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,450
You’re going to come again, huh?
147
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,570
Yeah, of course!
Until you change Isaribi back…
148
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,780
I’ll come at you again and again.
149
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,030
Water Style:
Great Cannonball Jutsu!
150
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,860
What’s wrong,
you’re done already?
151
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,780
Give it up already, kid!
152
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,150
I told you!
153
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,690
Until I take Isaribi back…
154
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,950
I absolutely will not…quit!
155
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,450
Why…
156
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,530
would you go that
far to save me?
157
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,690
I can’t keep up with the farce.
158
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,860
Come on! Sea Monster!
159
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,700
Do it…Sea Monster!
160
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,820
Hey! Let go of me, you!
161
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,780
Let me tell you that almost all of
Sea Monster’s body is made of water.
162
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,690
You can say it's like
a moving Water Prison Jutsu.
163
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,400
Naruto!
164
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,150
Damn…
165
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,530
You’re stupid.
166
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,240
Do you think something
like that will affect it at all?
167
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,200
Do you understand, Isaribi?
168
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,490
I am the only one
who can save you.
169
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,690
Now, finish them off!
170
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,490
What’s wrong?
171
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,360
You want to turn back into
a human, don’t you?
172
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,690
Then do as I say!
173
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,650
It’s no good…
174
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,690
It’s no good…
175
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,740
I can’t let Isaribi…
go to…that world…
176
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,950
This feeling…
177
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,820
SEAL
178
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,490
What?! What are these
extraordinary Chakras?
179
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,570
S-Sea Monster!
180
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,450
Isaribi…
181
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,650
I will never let Isaribi
go over there!
182
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,860
What are you…?!
183
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,690
Naruto…?!
184
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,360
He’s the same as you.
185
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,320
Same as me…?!
186
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,110
Yes…
187
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,570
The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
who long ago attacked our village,
188
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,690
is sealed inside Naruto.
189
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,280
And there was a time
190
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,700
when everyone in the village
treated him like a monster.
191
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,740
And…
192
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,240
And even so, he works so hard,
everybody approves of him.
193
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,700
I understand painfully enough
how you feel…
194
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,650
But…doing that…
lt's not good.
195
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,530
Those words…were true…
196
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,240
Naruto!
197
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,280
You bastard!
198
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,320
The wind blows, Ah…
199
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,070
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
200
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,690
What should be brought along?
201
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,690
Assemble them into a piece.
202
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,690
There is no second chance, never
203
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,360
How foolish it is to throw away
204
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,690
Acting so innocently, Ah…
205
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,530
The images.
206
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,610
It probably will not end
207
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,860
It probably will not end
208
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,690
Burn that love-filled heart,
209
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,700
Sail across a thousand dreams
210
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,740
Running freely
211
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,530
To take hold of the world in hand
212
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,650
The clouds scatter
213
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,610
The sun sets yet again
214
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,110
The solo parade begins to move.
215
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,450
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
216
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,820
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
217
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,700
Oh, I was able to do
the Chief Toad summoning
218
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,240
for the first time in a while!
219
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,700
Now, prepare yourself,
you flabby jerk!
220
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,610
Tomorrow will never come
for you again!
221
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,820
This itches!
222
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,030
What? It’s not a good time
to be getting scared now!
223
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,690
It really itches.
224
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,690
Now, Chief Toad,
take him out good.
225
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,780
Naruto, summoning me in
salt water like this!
226
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,740
I could take your life for this!
227
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,690
What…?!
228
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,860
Next time: “Battle at Sea:
The Power Unleashed!”
//%
1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,390
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,310
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:12,390
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,730
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,270
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,900
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,390
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,940
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,480
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,520
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,150
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,400
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,600
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:19,390
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,190
The Missed Target
16
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,850
Naruto, Choji, gather all of them!
17
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
I know!
18
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,190
Yeah!
19
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,350
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
20
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,690
Pick it up! Pick it up!
21
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,600
Over here!
22
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,560
Over there!
23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,520
Don’t lose any of them!
24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,440
Yeah!
25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,390
Pick it up!
26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,390
Over there!
27
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,390
Go over there!
28
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,390
Hey that’s mine!
29
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,730
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
Arm!
31
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,730
Where did that bird go?
32
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,980
Damn it! We lost it!
33
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,150
Over there!
34
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,730
Just a little more…
35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,650
This is a mission believe it or not!
36
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,810
This is something very important…
37
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,690
I beg you…
Please let go of it!
38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,440
We have trouble, Lady Tsunade!
39
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,270
What is it?!
40
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,850
Those papers
scattered throughout the village,
41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,350
are the plans that were stolen
from the carpenter boss.
42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,560
Currently, Shikamaru and his team
have finished collecting all the plans,
43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,390
and rechecking them.
44
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,230
But it seems like they have
collected all of them.
45
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,190
What is the meaning of this?
46
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,390
I have no idea…
47
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,390
Lady Tsunade! We have a report
48
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,390
from those who headed to
the Hidden Waterfall Village!
49
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Was there movement?!
50
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,100
Actually, it turns out that it was only
a large-scale practice run!
51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,900
They are saying that they see
no signs of an invasion of Leaf Village.
52
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,390
What?!
53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,230
It seems as though they have
already finished their practice run,
54
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,020
and the Hidden Waterfall Village
is back to normal.
55
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,920
So Genno and Hidden Waterfall Village
have nothing to do with each other…?
56
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,390
Disengage the S-Level
Emergency Security Alert!
57
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,980
Order all forces back to village!
58
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Yes!
59
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,390
What in the world
was that man plotting?!
60
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,690
Lady Tsunade!
61
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,100
What now?!
62
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,980
The body that
the Anbu Black-Ops gathered…
63
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,390
It's…
64
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,850
It’s not Genno…?
65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,980
What does that mean?
66
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,390
But I thought that Old Man Genno was
cornered by the Anbu Black Ops
67
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,650
and blew himself up.
68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,600
He traded places with a corpse that
he had ready right before the explosion…
69
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,350
That’s a huge possibility!
70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,390
We’re in the middle of confirming that!
71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,390
Their appearances look similar,
but small details bring up questions!
72
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,600
Most likely…it’s another man.
73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
Are you telling me
he fooled the Anbu Black Ops!
74
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,730
That means, Genno is…
75
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,810
He’s still alive!
76
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,440
Damn! What is that man up to…?
77
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,480
Over there.
Behind that tree.
78
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
It’s here!
79
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,190
I see… The Old Man Genno used
this hole to get away.
80
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,060
He camouflaged it well.
81
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,480
If it wasn’t for the Byakugan,
we would have missed it.
82
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Not only that…
83
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,230
This hole is made so that it closes
naturally by the weight of the earth.
84
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,810
If we came here another day later,
85
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,270
it would have been
extremely difficult to find,
86
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,390
even with the Byakugan.
87
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
And to prove that,
88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,480
you can barely see any sign of
an entrance to this hole.
89
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,520
Akamaru, can you follow his scent?
90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,270
He’s even got getting rid of
his smell covered…
91
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,520
Where could he have gone?
92
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,150
Our conclusion is that…
93
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,480
Old Man Genno is still alive
94
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
and there's a possibility that
he's hiding in Leaf Village.
95
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,480
He got cornered,
and faked his own suicide,
96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,560
and stole the plans so that he could…
97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,060
make all of us turn our eyes outside
of the village.
98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,350
He could have already known
about the big practice run
99
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,650
in the Hidden Waterfall Village
and used that to his advantage.
100
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,770
B-But the Anbu Black Ops
started to mark Genno because
101
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,230
they happened to find out that his letter
of recommendation was a fake, right?
102
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,440
Was it a coincident…?
103
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,310
Isn’t it strange that
a real letter of recommendation was
104
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,020
at the house of the carpenter boss
he worked for?
105
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,730
Then what is his true goal?
106
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,100
If we knew the answer to that,
we wouldn’t be struggling so much…
107
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,390
Shikamaru!
108
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,150
The only thing I can say now is…
109
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,150
The number of Shinobi in this village
currently is at its lowest ever.
110
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,520
We only have a bare minimum
of us here!
111
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,440
And most of their eyes are
looking outside of the village.
112
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,730
Even if Genno was walking around
as he was humming on the streets,
113
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,480
no one would suspect anything of him.
114
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,350
Did he set a trap in the village?!
115
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,400
Could the fact that that
he scattered the plans around mean that
116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,390
he’s already done setting his trap?
117
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,560
No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.
118
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,650
We can’t leave this place
without any security,
119
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,600
but we have few people…
120
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,520
Then where do we look?
121
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,730
The Academy.
122
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,190
The Academy?
123
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,270
Why the Academy out of all
the important facilities in the village?
124
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,900
Out of all the sites Genno worked on,
125
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,060
only the Academy’s repair plan
was stolen.
126
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,390
It’s hard to think that
it was a coincidence
127
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,810
for it to disappear at this timing.
128
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,390
Byakugan!
129
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,390
Well?
130
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
There’s nothing in this room.
131
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,060
Then…move ahead to the next room.
132
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Byakugan!
133
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,270
Seems like there’s nothing in this area
134
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,350
Can’t you look at
the entire campus at once?
135
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,770
And we have Hinata too, you know?
136
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,310
That would be possible
if we know what the target was,
137
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,520
but we’re looking for
something suspicious.
138
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,900
We’ll have to take the basic route.
139
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,400
Hey! Wait a minute!
140
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,150
You’re in the way!
141
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,230
And there’s too many… people here.
142
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,950
Like I said!
143
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,160
All I want is for you guys to come outside
even just for a moment!
144
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,200
Our teacher told us to study on our own
in the classroom for today!
145
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,290
We can’t go out of the room!
146
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,290
There are no teachers today!
147
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,490
So nobody would know
if you left the class!
148
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,490
We used to skip class when
lruka Sensei wasn’t looking
149
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,830
when we were younger.
150
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,870
Oh! A delinquent!
151
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,490
– Delinquent! 					– Delinquent!
152
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,620
We have to check this area!
153
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,490
Besides, all the teachers have gone
on a mission to protect the village.
154
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,410
Why are you guys still here?
155
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,250
They must be useless.
156
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,200
What did you say?!
We’re also protecting the village too…
157
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,160
Naruto. You’re wasting time
158
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Let’s crush them!
159
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,370
What?
160
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,000
The Expansion Jutsu!
161
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,000
We’re going to tell on you to our teacher!
162
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Yeah, do as you please!
163
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,910
Idiot!
164
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,830
Let’s practice our Kunai Knives.
165
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,250
Sounds good.
166
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,250
It doesn’t seem like
there’s anything suspicious…
167
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,660
Hurry up!
168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,490
Wait!
169
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,500
Come on.
I’m begging you to leave!
170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Naruto!
171
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,870
Where did those kids from
the next classroom go?
172
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I don’t know…
173
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,330
They were going to practice
their Kunai Knives.
174
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,490
That’s what they were saying.
175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,490
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That’s right.
176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,330
They’re practicing their Kunai Knives
in a place like that?
177
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,250
I’ll do next.
178
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,410
Ok. Do your best!
179
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,450
Do it!
180
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,750
Yeah!
181
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,750
Oh, so close.
182
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,490
They really are practicing…
183
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,790
When we were
students at the Academy,
184
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,950
we used to skip class and come here.
185
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,160
The teacher’s couldn’t find us here,
it really was great!
186
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,830
I read comic books, and took naps…
187
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,450
That’s right, I ate potato chips.
188
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Well, that’s no good!
189
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,490
You can learn something from those kids.
190
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,490
Even if the teachers doesn’t see you,
191
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,950
you should still commit to your practice!
192
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,620
They’re true models of students!
193
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,000
Wonderful!
I’m excited! I’m moved!
194
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,580
I’d like to take class with them!
195
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,200
We wouldn’t want to interrupt.
Let’s go.
196
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Yeah…
197
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Naruto…
198
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
What?
199
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,830
Did they have that before?
200
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,490
I’m going to get this one!
201
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,750
Ouch!
202
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,950
I had it!
203
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,000
It seems pretty new.
204
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,450
Genno could have made it…
205
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,330
I-I’m going to get Neji or Hinata!
206
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,830
You guys get out of the way.
207
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,000
You’re getting in the way of our practice.
208
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,080
O-Oh I’m sorry!
209
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,330
I’m next!
210
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,490
Byakugan!
211
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,370
It’s a Paper Bomb!
lt’s hidden behind the wall!
212
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,700
What, inside the wall?!
213
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,490
It’s completely hidden inside the wall.
214
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,040
But then how do you
detonate it…?
215
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,490
Oh, there she is.
216
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,620
Hey! Hinata!
217
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Naruto.
218
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,490
Naruto…
219
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Hinata, go out with me!
220
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,080
Wh-What are you saying
at a time like this?!
221
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Huh?
222
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,490
I-I don't know… Go out with you?
223
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,450
You won’t?
224
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,490
I-I’m not necessarily saying no…
225
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,410
Then I’ll just ask Neji then.
See you later!
226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What?
227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,040
There’s a thin thread attached
to the Paper Bomb.
228
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,490
A thread?
229
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,660
It’s probably a special thread
used to ignite it.
230
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,160
He's probably is going to detonate it
from a distance…
231
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,450
Where is that thread connected to?!
232
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,910
It goes around the classroom and…
233
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,450
It goes outside…
towards the training hall…?
234
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
There’s a log standing…
235
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,000
This… Could it be?!
236
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,000
Neji! Come with me for a second!
237
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,540
What is it!
We’re in the middle of something…
238
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,000
Actually there’s a strange log standing
in the training hall over there.
239
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,500
We wanted him to check it.
240
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,490
That’s the triggering device!
241
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Huh?
242
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,040
Try loosening up your shoulders
and then throw it.
243
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,080
Shut up.
244
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,500
All right, I’m up next.
245
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,490
There should be a target on the log.
246
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,750
Yeah, there is.
247
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,330
The center of the target
is the triggering device!
248
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,790
When a Kunai Knife hits the center…
249
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,410
the device will activate…
250
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,490
And the Academy will explode!
251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,250
So close!
252
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,450
If you focus, you’ll hit the target.
253
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,490
All right, I’m going to hit this time.
254
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,490
Focus…
255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And target!
256
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,500
Don’t let anybody hit the target!
257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,490
All right, I hit the target!
258
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,490
You did it!
259
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Oh?
260
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:52,250
The tip is cracked.
You always have to take care of your tools.
261
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,660
Damn, I thought that I hit the target.
262
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,490
This way! Behind there!
263
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,910
All right…
I’m going to hit it for sure!
264
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,490
That’s the spirit!
265
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,200
This looks good!
266
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,500
This time I’m going to hit it!
267
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
Bushy Brow!
268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Stop it, Lee!
269
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,790
What?
270
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,490
Oh, did I scare you?
271
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,490
I’m sorry. I just dropped my Ninja tool…
Here.
272
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,490
Bushy Brow, you did it!
273
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,490
I had the target!
274
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,450
Why did you get in the way?!
275
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,490
Be quiet!
lf that had hit the target,
276
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,910
the Academy would have exploded!
277
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,540
What…?
278
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,910
For real?
279
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,290
A triggering device in here…huh?
280
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,490
When something hits the center,
the Academy explodes.
281
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,040
So there hasn’t been anyone
who’s been able to hit the center.
282
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,700
We really were lucky.
283
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,120
We were lucky, huh?
284
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,490
So who started to practice
throwing their Kunai-Knife here?
285
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,490
Who? Who was it?
286
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,490
Somebody told us that we'd be praised
287
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,160
if we got better at Kunai-Knife throwing
in secret from the teachers.
288
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,540
"in secret from from the teachers…"
289
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,540
Whoever must’ve used Genjutsu
to make them think that.
290
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,450
It must be Genno.
291
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,490
What happened?
292
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,750
W-Well… There's more than one thread
coming out of the triggering device.
293
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,250
Is that true Hinata?
294
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,250
Yeah…
295
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Byakugan!
296
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:16,490
True.
There's not just one…two…no, three?
297
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
Where are they connected to?
298
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,000
Outside of the academy… 					No!
299
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,750
Wait! It’s hard to see from here.
300
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,750
U-Umm… M-Me too…
301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Byakugan!
302
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,450
Byakugan!
303
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,490
I found one.
304
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
I found one, too
305
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,490
Tell us the location.
306
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,080
No, wait.
The thread splits again.
307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Over here too…
308
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,160
Th-This is…
309
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,490
No…way…
310
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
It can't be…
311
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,790
Hey! What’s the matter!
312
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,120
There’s Paper Bombs planted
all over the village!
313
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,870
It’s not just 10 or 20…
314
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,290
It's countless numbers of them!
315
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,080
What?!
316
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,330
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is a nest of Paper Bombs!
317
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,700
On a checkerboard night
318
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,330
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
319
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,700
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
320
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,870
Suggestively
321
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,620
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
322
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,450
The Trombone gradually going off-key
323
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:11,910
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
324
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,950
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
325
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,160
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
326
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,330
– Now, the Academy is safe.
– All right!
327
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,040
It’s too early to feel relieved.
328
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,700
If he realizes the Paper Bombs
are being deactivated,
329
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,490
he might blow up the village
by a different method.
330
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,750
Then we have to evacuate
everyone quickly!
331
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,330
– Then he'll know what we're doing!
– That means…
332
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,540
Pretend we don’t notice anything
and get rid of the Paper Bombs.
333
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,490
Everyone, get to it at once!
334
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,490
– Yeah! 					– Yes.
335
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,490
Next time: “The Powerful Helper”
//%
1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,060
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,000
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,270
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,670
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,340
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,080
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,880
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,720
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,090
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,900
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,400
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,770
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,740
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,170
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,750
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,250
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,890
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,900
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,970
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,020
Inari! Give me a hand.
21	02:16:45:14	02:16:46:22
I'll be right there.
21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,870
This mist…
22
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,170
Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!
23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,580
I knew he was still alive.
24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,880
Making an appearance so soon, eh…
25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,880
Say, Kakashi Sensei.
26
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,890
This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,900
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,500
I see you've got those brats
with you as always.
29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,040
He's still trembling. Poor thing.
30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,450
I'm trembling with…excitement.
31
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,320
Do it, Sasuke.
32
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,230
I can see him!
33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,570
Well, well.
34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,440
So you discerned
the Water Doppelganger Jutsu.
35
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,470
That brat's grown quite a bit.
36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,710
So it seems.
38
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,800
Damn it!
39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm totally late!
40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,890
Well, well… It seems my prediction
was right on the money.
41
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,090
Prediction?
42
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,890
That little mask...
43
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,960
Oh!
44
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,960
I knew it… Heh!
45
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,230
So the Elite Shinobi of
the Hidden Mist thing
46
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,870
was a bald-faced lie!
47
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,940
No matter how you look at him,
he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.
48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,270
Standing together with him and all…
49
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,340
How dare he show up like that
after what he did!
50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I hate brats who think they're so cool…
51
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,520
He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei.
52
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,180
Oh…really?
53
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,890
I'll do it.
54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,890
Huh?
55
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,290
With his bad acting…
I hate brats who think they're so cool!
56
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,700
Sasuke, you are so cool!
57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,900
That Sakura doesn't take stabs at Sasuke…
58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
He's an impressive youth.
59
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,340
Hmm...
60
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,670
Even though those Water Clones
61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,380
have only 1/10th the strength
of their original...
62
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,880
To think he went that well.
63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,980
However, you made
the preemptive move.
64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,690
Go!
65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,020
Right!
66
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,560
What?!
67
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,610
Haku's Secret Jutsu:
Crystal Ice Mirrors
68
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,720
Are you Tazuna's daughter?
69
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,590
Sorry, but you're coming with us.
70
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Mom!
71
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,010
Don't come out!
Get out of here, quick!
72
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
What's with you, brat?!
73
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,880
Shall we take him, too?
74
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,550
One hostage is fine.
75
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,890
Hostage…?!
76
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,090
Then...
77
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,420
Shall we kill him?
78
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,900
Wait!
79
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,800
If you lay a hand on that child…
80
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,870
I'll bite off my tongue
and kill myself!
81
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,450
You want a hostage, right?
82
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,790
Thank your mom, kid.
83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,270
Oh, man… 					lt's not enough…
84
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,870
Knock it off.
You just tried out your sword earlier.
85
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,540
Forget it already and
let's take the woman.
86
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,890
Mom, I'm sorry...
87
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm so sorry!
88
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,530
I'm weak, so I can't protect you…
89
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,540
I don't want to die…
I'm scared!
90
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,980
You crybaby…
91
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,050
So you're just gonna cry all day
like the lead in a tragedy?
92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,250
An idiot like you can just
cry forever! You crybaby!
93
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,860
He's probably tired of crying.
94
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,630
So, he knows the true meaning of
the word strong.
95
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,130
Like your father.
96
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,240
For the things I truly hold
dear to myself…
97
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,710
I protect them until the end
with both these arms,
98
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,080
even if it looks like I might lose my life!
99
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,720
Inari…
100
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,930
Can I…
101
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,930
can I also become strong…?
102
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,810
Dad!
103
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,250
Looking at that beautiful skin
of yours makes me want to cut you.
104
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,350
Hey…walk faster.
105
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,850
Wait!
106
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,920
Inari!
107
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,430
What? It's just the kid from before.
108
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,130
Get…get away from my mom!
109
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,970
Man…This brat's hopeless.
110
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,510
Let's do it!
111
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,610
If you do that, I'll bite off
my tongue and--
112
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,080
Shut up. Go to sleep.
113
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,880
I…na…ri.
114
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,260
Well, well…
He can see that speed, eh…
115
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,900
Yes…
116
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,600
Sakura, surround Tazuna and
don't move away from me.
117
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,870
Let Sasuke handle him!
118
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,540
Okay.
119
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,950
I don't want to have to kill you…
120
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,250
I'd like for you to back down.
121
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
Nonsense…
122
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,360
I knew it…
123
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,230
But you won't be able to keep up
with my speed.
124
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,800
Also, I've already made
two preemptive moves.
125
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,270
Two preemptive moves?
126
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,640
The first one is the scattered water.
127
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,450
And the second one was
blocking one of your hands…
128
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,680
Therefore, you'll just be able
to defend my attack…
129
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,050
What?! With one hand he's…?!
130
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,890
A one-handed Sign?
131
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,430
I've never seen such a thing before…
132
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,900
A Thousand Needles of Death!
133
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,480
So he doesn't want to kill him…eh.
134
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,980
I wonder if that's how he really feels…
135
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,080
Sasuke!
136
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,090
Remember…that training…
137
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,760
Build up Chakra at one burst…
138
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,880
The Substitution Jutsu…?!
139
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,890
The woman… Hmm?
140
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,920
Sorry I was late.
141
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,900
Heroes usually appear
on the scene late, so…
142
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,030
Naruto…!
143
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,640
Inari, you did well!
144
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,470
Huh?
145
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,540
Thanks to you distracting them,
I was able to save your mom.
146
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,490
Naruto…how did you know that
those samurai were here?
147
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,760
In the forest, there was a boar that
had been cut-up with a sword.
148
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,530
Other than that,
there were trees with lots of cuts.
149
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,800
They headed in
the direction of your house…
150
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400
so I got worried.
151
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,270
I see.
152
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,870
Well…
153
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,010
If it isn't the no-good Ninja
that Tazuna hired…
154
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,440
Let's do it…
155
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,210
Yeah…
156
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,880
Here they come!
157
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,890
Hah! Something like that won't work!
158
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,890
Fools.
159
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,730
Prepare yourself!
160
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,880
W-Wow…!
161
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,950
It's done!
162
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,990
Naruto, you're just like... a Ninja!
163
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,190
You fool.
I was a Ninja to start with!
164
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,540
Build up Chakra at one burst…
165
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,110
to the feet!
166
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
He vanished…
167
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,900
You're surprisingly stupid…
168
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,140
From here on…
you'll only defend my attack!
169
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,350
To think Haku would
lose in speed…
170
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,530
It seems that I'm faster than you…
171
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,600
I can't have you mocking our team,
calling them brats…
172
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,000
He may not look it,
173
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,240
but Sasuke is the number one rookie
of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
174
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,540
And Sakura is our sharpest…
175
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,880
Hah! Serves you right!
176
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,020
And the other one is
the number one hyperactive,
177
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,390
knucklehead Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki.
178
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
You have a cold?
179
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,300
I'm okay.
180
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,670
Anyway...
Sorry about yesterday, Inari.
181
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,870
Huh?
182
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,080
Branding you a crybaby…
Forget I ever said that.
183
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,250
You're strong!
184
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,890
Dang it!
185
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,530
I…decided never
to cry again, but…
186
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:04,170
Now you'll laugh at me again
and call me a crybaby.
187
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,940
What're you saying…?!
188
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,950
It's okay…when you're happy.
189
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,030
It's okay to cry when you're happy!
190
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,260
Naruto…
191
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,880
Now then.
I can leave the rest to you, right?
192
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,880
Yeah…
193
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,720
Okay, I'm going to hop over
to the bridge for a bit.
194
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,890
Man, it's tough being a hero!
That's for sure!
195
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,870
Haku, do you know what this means?
196
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,140
At this rate, you'll be defeated
by your intended victim…
197
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,810
Yes…
198
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,880
What…?
199
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,980
It's unfortunate…
200
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,890
Is this…cold air…?
201
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,770
Hidden Jutsu!
202
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,720
Crystal Ice Mirrors!
203
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,500
What is it? What's that Jutsu?
204
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,920
Are these…mirrors?!
205
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
What…
206
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,430
in the world…?!
207
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,900
Damn it!
208
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,870
I'm your opponent, aren't I?
209
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,040
Since that Jutsu has appeared…
he's done for.
210
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,450
Now then…I'll start.
211
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,890
I shall show you...
my true speed!
212
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,930
Sasuke!
213
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,730
Sasuke!
214
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,690
If you make a move,
I'll kill those two!!
215
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,870
I'm sorry, Tazuna!
216
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm stepping away from here for a bit.
217
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,880
Sure. Go!
218
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,650
Sakura!
219
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,480
Sasuke!
220
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,690
Take this!
221
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,540
He caught it?!
222
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,990
What?!
223
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,900
Who is it?!
224
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,910
It's that idiot…that showoff…
225
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,380
The number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja…
226
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,460
Naruto Uzumaki…
227
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,600
is finally here!
228
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,330
Naruto Uzumaki is finally here!
229
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,670
It'll be okay.
230
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,870
Now that the hero of the story
has appeared,
231
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,970
I'll smash those stupid
funny-looking mirrors in no time…
232
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,180
Huh? Why won't mirrors
made of ice break?
233
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,880
Why won't they melt?
234
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,750
What the heck is going on here?!
235
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,890
Next episode:
"The Number One Hyperactive
Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!"
236
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,890
As for me, will I be able
to kick butt once again?
//%
1
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,860
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,930
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,200
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,610
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,580
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,250
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,920
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,660
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,190
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,000
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,500
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,800
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,270
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,820
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,350
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,960
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,070
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,500
This is quite some fog.
I can't see ahead.
21
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,750
The bridge should be visible soon.
22
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,520
When we reach the side of the bridge,
we'll be in the Land of the Waves.
23
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,280
Wooow! 					 It's huge!
24
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,880
H-Hey! 					Please keep it down.
25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,680
I took this boat out under cover of fog.
26
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,820
And I cut the engine
and am rowing by hand.
27
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,120
If they find us,
we'll be in deep trouble.
28
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,060
Mr. Tazuna.
29
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,340
I want to ask you something
before we arrive at the pier.
30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,080
The identity of your assailants,
and the reason why they are after you.
31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,080
If you don't tell us…
32
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,820
our mission may end
when you make landfall.
33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,530
The Assassin of the Mist
34
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,110
It appears I have no choice
but to tell you.
35
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,150
Frankly, I'd like you to listen.
36
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,880
Just as you said,
37
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,090
this may be beyond
the scope of your mission.
38
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,960
Actually, I am being targeted
by a terrifying man.
39
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,630
A terrifying man?
40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Who?
41
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,900
You guys have probably heard at
least his name before.
42
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,840
A shipping magnate
by the name of Gato.
43
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,080
What? Gato…of the Gato Company?
44
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,480
One of the world's richest men?
45
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,820
Who? What?
46
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,590
Yes…
47
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,460
On the surface, he's the chief executive
of a shipping company…
48
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,760
But underneath,
he is into drug-trafficking
49
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,830
and deals in contraband
using gangs and Ninjas.
50
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,440
Moreover, he runs a despicable business,
51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,110
ruthlessly taking over nations
and enterprises.
52
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,810
It was about one year ago…
53
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,620
when that man first set his eyes on
the Land of the Waves…
54
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,650
He used his wealth and violence
to enter this country,
55
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,290
and before anyone knew it,
56
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,360
he had taken complete control of the island's
maritime transportation and shipping.
57
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,030
Having a tight grip on the ocean, in an
island nation like the Land of the Waves,
58
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,370
means having control of finance,
the government, the people... everything.
59
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,810
The one thing Gato fears...
60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,150
is the completion of the bridge...
61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,780
that has been under construction
for some time now.
62
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,820
I see.
63
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,790
Since you're the one building the bridge,
you've become a hindrance.
64
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,830
Then, those Ninjas from before
were Gato's men…?
65
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,400
But I don't understand.
66
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,570
Your opponent is a dangerous one,
who will even use Ninja.
67
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,640
Why did you hide that fact from us
when you made your request?
68
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,140
The Land of the Waves…
69
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,520
is a very poor nation,
and even feudal lords have no money.
70
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,820
Of course, we ordinary citizens
have no money either.
71
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,790
We cannot afford to make requests of
Rank B or higher...
72
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,370
Well, if you pull out
of the mission when I land ashore,
73
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,340
I will, no doubt, be killed.
74
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,440
Killed sometime before I make it home.
75
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,810
But there's no need for concern!
76
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,610
Should I die, my cute grandchild
who will turn eight...
77
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,820
will only cry his heart out!
78
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,450
Oh!
79
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,860
And... my daughter will only blame
the Hidden Leaves Ninja
80
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,490
for the rest of her life
and grieve in solitude!
81
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,830
Oh, it's not your fault at all!
82
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,770
Well...
83
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,140
I guess we have no choice.
84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,940
Let's continue as his bodyguards.
85
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,780
Oh! I am most grateful!
86
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,450
I won!
87
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,820
We'll be arriving soon.
88
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,900
Tazuna.
89
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,030
It appears we haven't been noticed
up until this point…
90
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,830
Thanks.
91
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,810
This is as far as I go.
92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
See you around.
93
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,910
Yeah. You've been a big help.
94
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,820
Be careful.
95
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,060
Okay!
96
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,630
Get me home safely.
97
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,930
Right.
98
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,040
When they next attack,
it won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin.
99
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,280
Cripes!
100
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,320
I won't let this guy do
all the fun stuff anymore!
101
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,200
There!
102
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Heh… Just a mouse.
103
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,810
Quit trying to show off!
104
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,120
There was nothing there
in the first place!
105
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,820
Please, Naruto.
106
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,620
Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly.
107
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,820
They're really dangerous.
108
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,830
Hey brat!
Don't be doing anything confusing!
109
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,160
Huh? I sense a presence there!
110
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,960
No, over here?!
111
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,830
There!
112
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,700
Stop it, already!
113
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,980
S-Someone's really been targeting us
the whole time!
114
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,410
Yeah right!
115
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,820
Knock it off, you!
116
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,190
Naruto!
What have you done?!
117
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,590
It's a bunny!
118
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,090
I'm sorry.
119
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,260
I didn't mean to…
I'm sorry, bunny.
120
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,830
It's just a rabbit, eh.
121
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,400
That's a snow rabbit.
122
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,810
But that doesn't explain
its fur color...
123
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,810
The coat turns white only during winter
when there is little sunlight.
124
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,960
Which means...
125
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,130
that snow rabbit was raised indoors
without sunlight to be used as a substitution.
126
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,270
Guess they're already here…
127
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,940
I'm sorry…
128
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:10,080
I see… The Demon Brothers wouldn't
be enough to take on these guys.
129
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,450
The Copy Ninja from the
Village of the Hidden Leaves.
130
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,190
"Sharingan" Kakashi is with them…
131
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,890
Everyone, get down!
132
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,420
If I'm not mistaken, he's…
133
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,520
Here we go!
134
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,360
Here we go, here we go,
here we go!
135
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,160
I'm going to do it this time.
136
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,200
I won't lose to Sasuke!
137
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,930
Well, well.
138
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,900
If it isn't the Rogue Ninja
of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi!
139
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,370
Rogue Ninja? Whatever.
What's important now is…
140
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,040
Ready…
141
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,780
Go!
142
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,250
You're in the way.
143
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,480
Get back, you guys.
144
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,650
Why?!
145
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,090
He's on a totally different level from
the guys from the other day.
146
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,590
His being our opponent means…
147
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,830
Huh?
148
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,830
Oh.
149
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,700
that things might be tricky
as I am now.
150
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,400
I assume you are Kakashi,
the Sharingan user…
151
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,440
Sorry, but…
152
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,240
I'll have you hand over the old man.
153
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,200
Huh? Huh? Sharingan?
What's that?
154
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,130
What? What is he talking about?
155
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,070
Is this guy strong?
156
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,540
Sharingan…
157
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,810
Get in Manji battle formation, you guys.
158
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,270
Protect Tazuna…
159
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,810
Don't involve yourselves in the fight.
160
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,510
Huh?
161
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,580
That's the teamwork
in this situation.
162
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,750
Huh?!
163
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,590
Fight me.
164
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,830
W-What's this eye…?
165
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,830
Well now...
166
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,570
I never expected to see
the rumored Sharingan this soon…
167
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
This is an honor.
168
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,810
Everyone's been saying Sharingan...
169
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,810
What is it?!
170
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,980
…Sharingan.
171
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,810
Power that the light of the eye generates,
and the pupil emanates.
172
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,020
The user of
the so-called Visual Jutsu (Art)
173
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,820
is said to possess the vision to see through
all Genjutsu (Illusionary Art),
174
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,190
Taijutsu (Physical Art),
and Ninjutsu (Ninja Art),
175
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,190
and is able to deflect them.
176
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,430
The Sharingan is a type of eye
that is unique
177
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,400
to the user of the Visual Art.
178
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,740
However, that is not the only power of
the Sharingan.
179
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,810
Well said.
180
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,810
That is not all.
181
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,520
What's more frightening is that
such an eye
182
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,250
can assess an opponent's techniques
and copy them.
183
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,830
When I was in the Anbu Black Ops
of the Hidden Mist,
184
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,130
search information
about you was in the Bingo Book
185
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,800
I would carry around with me.
186
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,370
There was also something
else in the book...
187
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,210
About the man who has copied
over one thousand skills…
188
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,150
Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
189
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,820
What? Kakashi Sensei
is that incredible a Ninja?
190
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,360
W-Wow!
191
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,830
What does this mean?
192
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
The Sharingan…is a special trait
193
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,000
that appears in only a select few
even among the Uchiha clan.
194
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,110
Could it be, that this guy…
195
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,840
Let's end the talking here.
196
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,810
I must kill that old man immediately.
197
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,830
But, Kakashi, it seems
I have to defeat you first.
198
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,440
Over there!
199
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,610
And he's even on the water?
200
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,520
He's building up quite a bit of Chakra!
201
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,700
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu.
202
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,610
He's vanished?!
203
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,810
Sensei!
204
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,820
He'll probably come to erase me first…
205
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,020
What is he?
206
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,820
Zabuza Momochi.
207
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,720
He's a Anbu Black Ops member
in the Hidden Mist and
208
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,590
is known as "the silent killing"
technique expert.
209
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,830
S-Silen...?
210
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,730
As the name suggests…
211
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,830
it's a killing skill that's implemented
in an instant in silence.
212
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,810
By the time you realize it,
213
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,880
it's possible you may find yourself
in the afterlife.
214
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,910
I haven't totally mastered
the use of my Sharingan.
215
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,280
So don't lower your guard, you guys.
216
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,360
Well, if we fail, we'll only die.
217
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,190
How can you be so carefree?!
218
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,000
The mist is steadily getting thicker!
219
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,810
The Land of the Waves
is surrounded by ocean.
220
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,410
So mist rises very easily.
221
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,410
Sensei!
222
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,120
Eight spots.
223
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,030
Huh? What?
224
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
The larynx, the spine,
the lungs, the liver...
225
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,400
The jugular and the subclavian veins.
226
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,040
The kidneys, the heart.
227
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,170
Now then, which vulnerable spot
would be good?
228
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,540
What an intense thirst for blood!
229
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,740
If I take even one breath,
or move my eyes,
230
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,410
I will be marked and killed -
that's what I'm feeling.
231
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,380
If I'm stuck like this for an hour,
I'll go mad!
232
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,190
Facing a Jonin's intent to kill…
233
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,220
This sensation is like having
my life being held in limbo…
234
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,830
No way! I'd rather die
to escape this feeling!
235
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,700
Sasuke.
236
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,070
Don't worry.
I'll protect you with my life.
237
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,840
I will not allow
my comrades to get killed.
238
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,820
I wonder about that...
239
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,330
It's over.
240
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,590
Sensei! 					Behind you!
241
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,960
Die!
242
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,910
The Water Clone Jutsu?
243
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,650
It can't be!
244
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,500
In this mist…
245
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,440
did he actually copy me?
246
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,480
Don't move.
247
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,390
It's over.
248
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,700
O-Oh no!
249
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,400
Even Kakashi Sensei fell under
Zabuza's Jutsu.
250
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,600
I've got to escape.
251
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,840
I'll get killed, for real.
252
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,170
This pain.
253
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,410
What am I doing?!
254
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,750
I'd decided, hadn't I?
Not to run away no matter what happens.
255
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,120
Next episode:
"The Oath of Pain!"
256
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,420
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,820
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,860
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,130
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,540
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,480
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,150
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,820
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,590
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,150
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,920
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,400
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,780
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,750
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,210
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,780
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,290
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,860
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,000
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,320
Sasuke here at Point B!
21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,620
Sakura here at Point C!
22
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,530
Naruto here. I'm at Point A!
23
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
You're slow, Naruto!
24
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,830
Okay, the seventh squad…
25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:03,900
Hm?!
26
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,240
The target has moved!
27
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,940
Follow it!
28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,110
Alright! It's over there!
29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,490
What's your distance
from the target?
30
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,320
Five meters!
I can go at anytime!
31
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,390
I'm ready, too!
32
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,830
Me, too…!
33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,830
Okay…
34
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,330
Do it!
35
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,800
Uryaaah!
36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,270
I got him!
37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
Does he have the ribbon
on his right ear…?
38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,410
Are you sure it's our target Tora?
39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,750
It's the target, no mistake.
40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,820
Alright, the mission to capture
lost pet "Tora" is complete!
41
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Isn't there a mission
with a greater sense of urgency?!
42
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,330
A Dangerous Mission!
Journey to the Land of Waves!
43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,670
Ohhh! My cute Tora!
I was worried to death!
44
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,880
The Wife of the Land of Fire's Daimyo
(Feudal Lord)
Madame Shijimi and Tora (the Cat)
45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,810
Serves him right, that stupid cat!
46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,150
No wonder he ran away…
47
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,850
…Now, then!
48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,090
The next mission for
Kakashi's seventh squad is…
49
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,730
An errand to the neighboring town…
to baby-sit the chief Councilor's boy…
50
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,520
Helping with digging
for potatoes, eh…
51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,890
Nooooo!
52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,900
No! No, thank you!
53
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,120
As for me,
54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,870
I want to do like
a more exciting mission!
55
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,380
Give us something else!
56
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,780
He's got a point…
57
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,810
Man… He's a pain!
58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,320
I thought it was about time
for him to get fretful…
59
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,020
You fool!
You're still bottom rookie!
60
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,740
At the start,
61
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,830
everyone moves up
the ladder
62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,830
by gaining experience
from simple missions!
63
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,530
B-But!
64
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,070
It's been nothing
but blah missions so far!
65
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,340
Knock it off!
66
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,070
Naruto!
67
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,810
It's necessary to explain to you
what a mission is…
68
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,110
Listen to me!
69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,380
Requests pour into the village
every day.
70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,820
They range from babysitting
to assassinations…
71
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,740
A wide spectrum of requests are
recorded on the request list…
72
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,630
They are separated into A, B, C,
and D ranks in order of difficulty.
73
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,750
In the village,
everyone below me
74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,370
is divided up by ability in the order of
Jonin, Chunin, and Genin.
75
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,000
We at the highest level distribute
the requests as missions
76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,510
to Ninjas who have abilities
that suit said mission.
77
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,820
And, if the mission is successful,
the fee comes in from the client.
78
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,190
Nevertheless, you guys
have just become Genin…
79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,260
rank D is about
the best you can do…
80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,870
Hm?!
81
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Yesterday's lunch was pork-bone
broth noodles,
82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,180
so today will be miso broth…
83
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,800
Listen!
84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,740
I-I'm sorry.
85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,080
Maaaan!
You always lecture me, old man!
86
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,180
But I'm not that little prankster
that you think I am!
87
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,790
Humph!
88
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,590
Maaan, I'm going to get scolded later…
89
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,870
This kid who could only
express himself with pranks…
90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,830
Okay, fine!
91
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,410
Huh…?!
92
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,110
If you insist…
93
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,080
I'll have you do a Rank C mission…
94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,150
You'll be bodyguards for someone.
95
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,480
Really?!
96
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,820
Ah-ha!
97
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,020
Who? Who?
98
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,740
A feudal lord?!
99
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,320
Or, a princess?!
100
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,230
Don't get so hasty.
101
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,230
I'll introduce you now!
102
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,160
Could you please come in…?
103
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,830
Huh…?!
104
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,810
What's this? It's just a bunch
of darned squirts!
105
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,080
Huh…?
106
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,020
Particularly you, the smallest one
with the idiot face.
107
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,500
Are you really a Ninja?
108
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,920
Who's the smallest one with
the idiot face he's talking about…?
109
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,830
What?!
110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,130
I'll kill him!!
111
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,750
What good will it do to
kill the old man
112
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,580
you're supposed to be
guarding, you moron?!
113
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,820
I'm Tazuna,
veteran bridge builder.
114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,820
You'll be risking life and limb
in guarding me to the max
115
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,830
until I return to my land and
complete my bridge!
116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,650
All right!
117
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,660
We're off!!
118
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,150
What're you so excited about?!
119
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,410
You see, I've never left
the village before!
120
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,690
Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?!
121
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,570
I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him.
There's no need to worry.
122
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,000
...okay with this squirt?!
123
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,210
Anyone but this old dude, man…
124
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,770
He's really the worst client!
125
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,570
I'll tell him a thing or two…
126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,750
Hey, old man!
127
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,810
Don't be mocking Ninjas
so much!
128
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm awesome, you see!
129
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm a super-elite Ninja who
will be called Hokage one day!
130
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,920
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.
131
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,620
Remember it well!!
132
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,160
The Hokage's the super top-dog
Ninja in the village, right?
133
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,930
You sure as heck don't seem like
you could become the Hokage…
134
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,610
Aaah! Shut up!
135
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,770
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to become the Hokage!
136
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,450
You'll have no choice
but to acknowledge me then!!
137
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,620
I'll never acknowledge you, squirt…
138
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,350
Even if you become the Hokage!
139
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,850
What?! I'll kill you!
140
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,930
I told you to stop it, you moron!
141
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,830
No! At least let me have
one shot, just one…
142
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,500
Say…Mr.Tazuna…?
143
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,910
What is it?
144
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,610
Your country is
"The Land of the Waves,"  right?
145
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,910
What of it?
146
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,910
Say, Kakashi Sensei…
147
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,920
Are there Ninjas in that land, too?
148
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,320
No, there aren't Ninjas in
the Land of the Waves…
149
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,820
But in other nations, while cultures
and customs are different,
150
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,830
hidden villages exist,
and there are Ninjas there.
151
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,200
To the many nations on the continent,
152
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,700
the existence of Shinobi Villages is
a measure of the nation's military strength.
153
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,760
In other words,
154
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,610
that is how these nations maintain
their relationships with neighboring nations.
155
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,980
Even so, the villages are not
under the control of the nations.
156
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,790
They are equal in rank.
157
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,830
On a small island like
the Land of the Waves,
158
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,820
where it is difficult to be
influenced by other nations,
159
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,690
there is no need
for a Shinobi village.
160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,900
Among the respective nations
that possess a Shinobi Village,
161
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:29,410
the five nations of "Fire," "Water,"
"Lightning," "Wind," and "Earth,"
162
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,840
due to their large territory and
immeasurable power,
163
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,780
are called the "Five Great Nations."
164
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,250
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
of the Land of Fire,
165
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,350
the Village Hidden in the Mist
of the Land of Water,
166
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,190
the Village Hidden in the Clouds
of the Land of Lightning,
167
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,960
the Village Hidden in the Sand
of the Land of Wind,
168
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,330
the Village Hidden in the Rocks
of the Land of Earth.
169
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,210
Only the leaders of
each of these Hidden Villages
170
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,630
are allowed to have
the name of Kage, the Shadow.
171
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,010
The "Hokage"
(Fire shadow),"
172
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,420
"Mizukage" 					(Water Shadow),
173
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,580
"Raikage"
(Lightning Shadow),
174
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,780
"Kazekage" 					(Wind Shadow),
175
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,850
"Tsuchikage"
(Earth Shadow),
176
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,810
the so-called
Five Kage (shadows),
177
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,290
reign supreme over
the tens of thousands of Ninjas
178
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,880
in each nation
of the whole world.
179
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,490
No kidding…
Lord Hokage is that incredible!
180
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,890
I wonder if that blah old man
is really that incredible…
181
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,790
Sounds fishy!
182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,530
That can't be true! No way!
183
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,430
Hey!
184
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,070
You guys just doubted
Lord Hokage now, didn't you…?
185
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,750
Well…don't worry.
186
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,950
There are no Ninja battles
in Rank C missions.
187
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,820
Then, there's no worry of getting
into a scrape with foreign Ninjas…!
188
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,820
Of course, not.
189
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,840
What?!
190
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,790
Huh?!
191
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,110
W-What?
192
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,750
The first one!
193
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,830
K-Kakashi Sensei!
194
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,830
The second one…
195
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,370
The second one…
196
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,810
Ohhh…!
197
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,820
Hm?!
198
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
It doesn't come off!
199
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,170
W…Wow!!
200
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,140
Whoa!
201
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,040
Ugh!!
202
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,440
They'll come!
203
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,810
I have to do it…
I have to!!
204
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,780
Get back, sir!!
205
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:25,810
Yo…
206
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,150
Kakashi Sensei…! He's alive!
207
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,480
Humph! 					Show off…
208
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,960
Whaa--?!
209
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
Then, what was that…?
210
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,160
So Kakashi Sensei…used Substitutions…
211
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,070
Naruto…
Sorry I didn't help you right away…
212
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,030
I got you hurt.
213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,610
I didn't think you'd be
incapable of moving…
214
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,810
I was saved, somehow…
215
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,950
Anyhow, let me just say,
good job, Sasuke.
216
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,520
You, too, Sakura.
217
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
I…couldn't do anything…
218
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,190
but Sasuke…
219
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,230
It was his first real battle…
220
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,230
Didn't he feel scared, at all?
221
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,800
He saved me like it was nothing and
without getting any dirt on his clothes…
222
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,370
Hey…
223
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,340
Huh?!
224
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,810
Are you hurt…
225
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,410
scaredy cat...?
226
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,470
Sasuke!
227
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,820
Naruto!
228
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,820
These guys have poison
on their claws.
229
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,740
You need to
take out the poison quickly.
230
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,190
What?!
231
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,800
You have to open the wound and
drain the poisoned blood.
232
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,230
Don't move so much.
233
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,700
The poison will spread.
234
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,160
By the way, Mr. Tazuna…
235
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,270
W-What is it…?!
236
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,810
I have something
to talk to you about.
237
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,750
Chunin from the
Village Hidden in the Mist…
238
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,820
These guys are Ninjas known for
continuing to fight
239
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,950
no matter what the sacrifice.
240
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,860
How were you able
to detect our movements?
241
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,190
There probably wouldn't be
puddles of water
242
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,830
on a clear day like today,
when it hasn't rained for days.
243
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,440
Knowing that, why'd you leave it
to the kids to fight?
244
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,240
If I felt like it,
I could kill these guys instantly…
245
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,280
But… 					I had to know...
246
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,020
who the target
of these enemies was…
247
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,950
Hm?! What do you mean?
248
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,920
In other words...
249
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,830
what I mean is I had to know
if it was you,
250
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:01,030
or one of us Shinobi…
who was being targeted.
251
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,840
We haven't heard anything about
you being targeted by Ninjas.
252
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,820
The content of the request was
supposed to just be
253
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,880
protection from gangs,
thieves, and the like…
254
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,810
This is a mission with
a B rank or higher.
255
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,700
The request was supposed to be
256
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,790
for backup protection
until you finished building your bridge…
257
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,700
If our enemies were to be Ninjas,
258
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,830
the mission would've been
estimated without question
259
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,830
as an expensive
"B Rank"  mission.
260
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,170
It appears there's some kind
of good reason for this,
261
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,200
but being lied to in the request
won't do.
262
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,540
This is beyond the scope
of our mission.
263
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,540
This mission is too soon for us…
264
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,250
Let's give it up!
265
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,460
We need an anesthetic to
open Naruto's wound
266
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,820
and get out the poisoned blood…
267
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,820
We have to return to the village
and take him to a doctor…
268
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Hmmm…
269
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,190
Hm? What...?!
270
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,830
This sure is a burden!
271
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,770
Since we need to treat Naruto's wound,
shall we go back to the village…?
272
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,060
Huh!
273
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,740
Oh!
274
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,520
Why am I so different?!
275
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,830
Why's it always me…
Darn it!
276
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,530
Naruto! What're you doing?!
277
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,930
I should be getting stronger…
278
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,800
Here I'm steadily carrying
out missions and
279
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,500
doing special-skill training
by myself every day…
280
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,780
I'll never get into another situation
from which I'll have to be rescued.
281
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,950
I'll never be afraid
or a be a coward…
282
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,490
I won't lose to Sasuke…
283
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,830
I'm going to swear on
the pain of my left hand!
284
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,360
I'll protect you, old man…
with this Kunai knife!!
285
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,170
The mission continues!!
286
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,810
Naruto…
287
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,990
It's all well and good to
rid yourself of the poisoned blood,
288
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,810
but any more than that and
you'll bleed to death.
289
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,050
Things will get hairy if you don't
stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!
290
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,830
Yikes!
291
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,840
Argh! No! No!
292
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,350
I can't die like this, I say!
293
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,050
Show me your hand.
294
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,750
Nooo! Help me!!
295
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,820
Naruto!
296
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,240
You're really self-abusive,
aren't you!
297
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
That's masochistic!
298
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,620
The wound is…
299
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,650
already starting to heal…
300
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,460
Um…um…
301
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,960
Am I okay?
You look awfully serious…
302
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,170
Well…You should be okay.
303
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,810
Is it…the power of
the Nine-Tailed Fox…?
304
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,820
Did you say you failed?!
305
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,800
I paid a lot of money to hire
you guys
306
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,590
because you said
you were once hot-shot Ninjas!
307
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,990
Stop your darned grumbling…!!
308
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:00,500
Next time, I'll kill him with this…
head chopper!
309
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,080
I-It's really okay, right?!
310
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,000
It seems that the enemy
has hired good Ninjas…
311
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,820
On top of that, a tightened guard
on account of the Demon Brothers' failure
312
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,710
means that it won't be easy…
313
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,590
Just who do you think I am?!
314
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,260
This Zabuza Momochi,
who is called the demon of…
315
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,830
the Hidden Mist!!
316
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,790
We've finally landed ashore
in the Land of the Waves.
317
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,090
The guys before were
all well and good,
318
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,730
but there should be even
stronger guys lying in wait.
319
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,780
Okay! I'm going to regain
my honor and continue the mission.
320
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,250
No matter what enemy comes,
321
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll protect the old man
this time around for sure.
322
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,830
Oh, they wasted no time.
323
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,750
An impressive-looking guy with
a huge Katana has come.
324
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,320
Next episode:
"The Assassin of the Mist!"
325
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,920
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,860
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,130
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,540
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,210
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,950
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,820
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,590
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,960
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,830
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,230
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,600
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,570
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,040
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,620
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,120
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,820
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,830
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,830
Rockin' my heart
20
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,110
What's with you?!
21
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,240
Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!
22
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,920
Good morning!
23
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:29,990
Here.
24
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,520
Thank you.
25
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,830
Naruto didn't come back
last night, either?
26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
He's such a fool,
27
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,700
he's been out every night,
climbing trees.
28
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,540
He might be dead already
from using up too much Chakra.
29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,080
I wonder if Naruto's okay.
30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,080
To think a child's out in
the middle of the night.
31
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,820
Well, you don't need to worry.
32
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,820
Although he may not seem to be,
he's a full-fledged Ninja.
33
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,620
I wonder…
34
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,390
That idiot's probably
all pooped out right about now.
35
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,830
Sasuke?
36
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,230
I'm going for a walk.
37
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
But we're about to eat…
38
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,810
That was fast!
39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,740
You'll catch a cold if
you keep sleeping here.
40
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,480
Who're you?
41
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,320
Uh... Did you wake me up, sis?
I mean, what're you doing here?
42
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,290
I'm gathering medicinal herbs.
43
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,130
Herbs?
44
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,330
Yes. For healing injuries,
sickness and the like.
45
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,440
You got a lot to do early
in the morning, sis...
46
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,840
You, too.
47
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,810
What've you been doing
in a place like this so early?
48
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,820
Training!
49
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,120
Could it be that…
you're a Ninja or something?
50
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,490
What with that headband and…
51
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,700
Is that what I look like? Is it?
52
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,830
Yup! I'm a Ninja!
53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
No kidding.
You're great, aren't you.
54
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,710
But…why are you training?
55
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,610
As for me,
I want to get stronger!
56
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,820
But, you already look
strong enough.
57
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,020
No, no! I want to get
even stronger!
58
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,820
What for?
59
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,830
To become the best Ninja
in my village!
60
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,060
I'm going to get everyone
to recognize my strength!
61
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,030
And I have to prove something
to a certain person!
62
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,170
Is that for the sake of somebody?
Or is it for your own sake?
63
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,810
Huh?
64
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,010
What's so funny?!
65
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,820
Do you have somebody
precious in your life?
66
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,920
Precious…?
67
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,790
What is it you want to say, sis?
68
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,720
What is it?
69
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,000
When a person has something
precious they want to protect…
70
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,830
that's when they can truly
become strong.
71
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,710
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so…
72
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,810
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed!
73
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,650
Get your hands off Iruka Sensei!
74
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,690
I'll kill you!!
75
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Yeah! I know that well, too!
76
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,930
You'll get strong.
77
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,830
Yeah!
78
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,500
I hope we meet again somewhere.
79
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,810
Oh…and…
80
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,540
I'm a man!
81
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,410
That can't be!
He's cuter than Sakura.
82
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,810
Why? That's strange.
83
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,910
This world is full of mystery…
84
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,820
Ouch.
Hey! What're you doing?!
85
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,990
Did you forget about mealtime,
you idiot?
86
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,130
Naruto?
87
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,400
What in the world is Naruto doing?
88
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,900
And Sasuke hasn't come back
from his walk either…
89
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,010
No way…
Naruto can climb that high now?
90
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,950
Wow!
91
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,520
How 'bout that, how 'bout that?!
92
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,460
As for me,
I can climb this high now!
93
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:49,990
Whoa!
94
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,830
Oh, you idiot!
95
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,830
This is bad!
96
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,900
Gotcha!
97
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,810
You fell for it, you fell for it!
98
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,910
Don't scare us like that!
99
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,480
I'll kill him later! Cha!
100
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,450
He's grown a little, eh.
101
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,160
Oh! You idiot, Naruto!
102
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,030
It's cuz you went overboard!
103
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
You fool.
104
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,810
Sasuke…?
105
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,810
Nice, Sasuke.
You're awesome !
106
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,580
These kids are really growing.
107
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,930
Naruto…
108
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,170
Uzumaki, eh.
109
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,540
You've recovered considerably.
110
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,110
All right…
111
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,820
Just a little more, Haku.
112
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,020
Yes.
113
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,000
Shall we go back?
114
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay!
115
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,280
They're late.
116
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,810
And not just Naruto,
but even Sasuke too.
117
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,690
What happened to you guys?
118
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,820
You're really muddy
and really wiped out.
119
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,830
We both…climbed up to the top.
120
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,700
Good.
121
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,830
Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guarding
Tazuna next time!
122
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,370
Got it! Whoa!
123
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,370
You idiot!
124
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,610
In just a teeny little bit,
the bridge will be complete.
125
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,410
It's thanks to you guys.
126
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,820
Even so, don't let your guard down…
127
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,290
I've really wanted to ask
you for a long time now…
128
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,960
But why are you still here
even though I lied about the mission?
129
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,830
To see what is right without doing it
bespeaks an absence of courage.
130
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,200
Like master, like man.
131
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,210
It's a teaching of the late Hokage.
132
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,340
The things I truly
hold dear to myself…
133
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,870
I'll protect until the very end
with both these arms.
134
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,810
Don't cry…lnari.
135
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,160
Why…?
136
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,630
What is it?
137
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,830
Why do you desperately work so hard
until you get like that?!
138
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,600
There's no way you'd be
a match for Gato's men even if you train!
139
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,610
No matter what cool things you say
or how much effort you make…
140
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,910
the weak always lose out…
141
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,810
against the truly strong!
142
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,590
Shut up. I'm not like you.
143
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,830
Shut up!
Looking at you makes me sick!
144
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,960
Sticking your nose in even though
you know nothing of this land!
145
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,830
I'm not like you who's always
acting frivolous
146
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,230
not knowing one thing about pain!
147
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,670
So you're just gonna cry
all day like the lead in a tragedy?
148
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,250
An idiot like you can just cry forever!
You crybaby!
149
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,120
Naruto! That's a bit harsh!
150
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Naruto…
151
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,610
Got a minute?
152
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,860
Naruto didn't mean any harm
with what he said…
153
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,390
He's just uncouth, so…
154
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,100
We heard the story
about your father from Tazuna.
155
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,810
Like you, Naruto never had
a father as a young child…
156
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,780
Actually he doesn't know either
of his parents.
157
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,110
Not only that.
He didn't have a single friend.
158
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:44,820
What?
159
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
However…
160
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,620
I've never seen him sulk,
be timid, or cry.
161
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,390
He's always eager,
wanting to be acknowledged by someone.
162
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,030
If it's for the sake of that "dream,"
he always risks his life.
163
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,810
He's probably tired of crying.
164
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,620
So, he knows the true meaning
of the word strong.
165
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,820
Like your father.
166
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,090
Naruto might understand your feelings
the most.
167
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,830
What Naruto said earlier…
168
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,800
There's no mistaking that
he's told himself that over and over again.
169
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,080
Okay, then!
I leave Naruto in your hands.
170
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,520
Because he's used his body
to the limit…
171
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,190
I don't think he'll be able
to move today.
172
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,530
Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right?
173
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, somehow.
174
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,900
We'll be going!
175
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,640
What're you doing?
176
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,610
I didn't hire you guys for charity work…
177
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,510
Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?!
Hey!!
178
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,850
Shall we go…Haku?
179
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,120
Yes.
180
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,810
I overslept!
181
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,880
Hey hey!! Where is everyone?
182
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,950
Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you
to rest and relax…today
183
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,280
I knew it.
184
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,090
They left me behind.
185
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
I'll be back.
186
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,700
Darn it!
They could've woken me up!
187
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,310
W-What the heck is this?!
188
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,490
What is going on?
What's happened?
189
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,220
It couldn't be…
190
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,830
Inari! Give me a hand.
191
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,360
Inari!?
192
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,830
I'll be right there.
193
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,980
This mist…
194
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,150
Sasuke! Sakura!
They're coming!
195
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,530
I knew he was still alive.
196
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,960
Making an appearance so soon, eh…
197
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,830
Say, Kakashi Sensei.
198
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,930
This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
199
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,810
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
200
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,610
I see you've got those brats
with you as always.
201
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,420
He's still trembling. Poor thing.
202
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm trembling with…excitement.
203
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,530
Do it, Sasuke.
204
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,480
I can see it!
205
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Well-well. So he could
see the Water Clones, eh.
206
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,490
That brat's grown quite a bit.
207
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,990
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
208
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,960
So it seems.
209
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,670
Phew, that was a close shave.
210
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,800
Sorry I was late.
But Inari, you were great.
211
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,780
I was able to save your mom
thanks to your courage.
212
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,240
Hey, wait a minute.
213
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,310
Doesn't the fact that
we were attacked mean
214
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,810
that Kakashi Sensei and
the others are in danger too?!
215
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,420
Next episode:
"Haku's Secret Jutsu: Crystal Ice Mirrors"
216
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,590
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,510
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,590
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,930
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,470
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,100
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,590
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,140
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,680
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,720
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,350
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,600
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,800
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,680
Like I said, I've already told you
everything I know.
16
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,590
You first met Genno at Ichiraku…
17
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,590
What did you talk about then?
18
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,220
I don’t remember everything!
19
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,430
That’s what we want to know.
20
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,470
If we analyze your conversation,
21
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,510
we might be able to figure out
who hired Genno.
22
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,050
We already know all
the conversations
23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,600
that you've had during
the past two weeks.
24
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,680
What we want to know is what
you guys talked about before that.
25
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,930
You tell me that but…
I don’t remember…
26
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,590
Then we’ll put you
under Regressive Hypnosis.
27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,850
Huh? Regressive Hypnosis?
28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,590
Using hypnosis,
29
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,600
we can bring out the memory of
the past from your subconscious…
30
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,590
Oh…
31
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,050
Just relax…
32
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,510
Back to the Past Jutsu!
33
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,590
Let’s start…
34
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,010
Right now you are traveling
through your memories…
35
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,850
A day ago… two days ago…
three days ago…
36
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,470
Keep going back into the past.
37
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,260
And…it’s the day you met
the old carpenter.
38
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,590
Where are you?
39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,510
Inside…the forest…
40
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,300
The Anbu Gives Up?
Naruto's Recollection
I was training on my own…
And it was lunch time so…
41
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,510
I headed for Ichiraku…
42
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,590
And that’s where…
43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,800
You met him not inside
the restaurant, but outside, yes?
44
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,300
Hey, what are you doing?
45
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,930
Huh? Oh yes…
46
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,970
I was just trying to figure out if
I should go into the restaurant or not.
47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,890
Is it any good?
48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,590
Old man, you’re not from here are you?
49
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,590
Oh… I’m a freelance carpenter.
How did you know?
50
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,680
Because all the Leaf Village people
know that Ichiraku’s ramen is the best!
51
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,590
I see…
52
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,640
Here you go!
Thanks for waiting!
53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,100
Yes! This is quite good!
54
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,260
Isn’t it?!
55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,590
Thank you for this meal!
56
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,180
You’re already done?
57
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,720
I am a growing boy!
58
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,760
Even an extra large isn’t
enough for me!
59
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,550
I see… Then, why don’t I give
you some of mine.
60
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,600
What? Are you sure?
61
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
Yes.
62
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,760
Lucky!
63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
Thanks…old man!
64
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,760
So…we said good-bye after
we finished eating the ramen…
65
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,180
And when did you meet him next?
66
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,430
I met him in front of Ichiraku again…
67
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,390
Byakugan!
68
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,800
There’s nothing here either…
69
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,390
I see…
70
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,430
Byakugan!
71
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,590
I see…
72
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,970
It seems like there were
odor neutralizing components
73
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,590
in last night’s smoke screen.
74
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,800
He was quite prepared
75
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,140
Then why did he get caught?
76
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,720
Well, that’s because our Anbu Black Ops
are really good, right…?
77
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,100
He should have known
78
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,180
that our Anbu Black Ops were excellent
before he infiltrated us…
79
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,930
He should have had
other escape routes ready.
80
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,970
Now that you mention it,
that sounds about right…
81
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,140
But right now,
there’s no way to find out.
82
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,390
Dead men tell no tales, I see.
83
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
Over here.
84
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,100
What are you doing?
85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,390
We’re connecting the pieces
of the corpse.
86
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,850
Connecting the pieces…
87
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,760
It was in a really awful shape.
88
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,930
From what I hear,
he had Paper Bombs all over his body…
89
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,760
Would you like to wait outside
until we’re done?
90
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,390
I-I suppose so…
91
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
I’ll stay here!
92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
What?
93
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,640
You’re quite impressive…
94
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,930
Sakura.
95
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,100
And he gave me eggs and
barbeque pork that time…
96
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,010
He’s talking about Ramen again.
97
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Shh!
98
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,180
Oh, I remember that time…!
99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
What happened?
100
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,590
He showed…me a photograph.
101
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,850
A photograph?
102
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,970
A photograph of a guy that
looked about my age.
103
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,590
When I asked him why
he was so nice to me…
104
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,890
I have a grandson.
105
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,800
He’s about the same age as you.
106
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,140
So I can’t think of you as a stranger.
107
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,010
I look forward to treasure hunting with
my grandson on my days off.
108
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,010
Treasure hunting?
109
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Yeah…
110
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,590
What, you’re already done eating?!
111
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,510
Then I’ll give you some of mine.
112
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,890
Thanks, old man!
113
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,550
What happened to your hand?
114
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,010
Oh… It’s a scar from a long time ago
115
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,180
when I accidentally cut myself
with a saw.
116
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,220
Oh.
117
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,260
And then he gave me
his ramen again…
118
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,590
Genno has no relatives…
119
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,010
Then his story about
his grandson a lie?
120
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,590
We started marking him the next day.
121
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,050
I think any more inquiries are pointless.
122
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,300
I guess he wouldn’t be careless enough
123
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,930
to leak any information even to a Gennin.
124
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,760
An emergency report
from Lady Tsunade!
125
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,220
I see… There was nothing unusual
about any of the buildings.
126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,590
They were all built
according to their plans…
127
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,590
There were no signs of any traps.
128
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,720
So was it just camouflage for him
to sneak in as a carpenter?
129
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,140
It’s too soon to make a judgment on that.
130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,970
If he was just supposed to
steal the plans,
131
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,220
there was no need for him
to be a carpenter.
132
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,590
By the way,
what were you guys looking up?
133
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,760
We got a list of places where
he used to stop by
134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
from his carpenter buddies,
135
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,010
and we’re looking through
all those places,
136
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,970
but so far we haven’t found any clues.
137
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Oh, there’re a lot of restaurants…
138
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,140
Yeah… Seems like he never
went out besides to go eat.
139
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,970
In the meantime, Hinata,
you go see Ino and Sakura
140
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,010
at the forensics center.
141
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,050
Neji and Choji, you guys go
help Kiba and Shino!
142
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,510
Understood.
143
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,590
Then, we should get going too…
144
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,970
Shikamaru!
145
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,850
Lady Tsunade is calling for you!
146
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,260
The Fifth Hokage is?
147
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,930
What?! The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls?
148
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,590
It seems that they’ve committed
all their troops into battle position.
149
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,220
They’re calling it
a big practice run, however…
150
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,050
Big practice run…?
151
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,720
I don’t think I need to say more, but…
152
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,220
It’s been used many times in the past.
They get all of their troops together
153
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,590
for the purpose of a big practice run
and then invade another country…
154
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,890
Furthermore, there is information that
Genno stayed in
155
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,970
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
156
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,930
before coming to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
157
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,640
It wouldn’t be unusual if there
was some sort of connection.
158
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,300
Most of the Ninja we've deployed
159
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,510
have already been mobilized
to the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
160
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,930
Crossing the border will be
taken as a sign of willful invasion.
161
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,590
We will attack anyone that enters.
162
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,720
Shikamaru, I want you to
head over to the border, too!
163
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,680
I don’t think that there’s
a need for us to go.
164
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,590
Shikamaru?!
165
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,010
What do you mean…?
166
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,640
Naruto. 					Hey, Naruto!
167
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,890
Huh?
168
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,390
You’re getting in the way of my business
by standing there!
169
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,590
Oh… Sorry.
170
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,800
Now that I think about it,
171
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,970
I’ve never seen the old man finish
his ramen…
172
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,430
Could it be that he hated ramen?
173
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,550
But then why did he come to
lchiraku all the time?
174
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,590
Tell us why.
175
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,100
Ten Gennin and one Chunin…
176
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,890
Our presence or absence won’t
make much of a difference
177
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,140
to the overall situation.
178
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,930
What is your point…?
179
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,590
I don’t like it…
180
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,470
Old Man Genno’s actions…
181
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,930
After the investigation,
I’ve figured it out…
182
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,220
His everyday activities were
quite impressive…
183
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,180
His abilities as a carpenter
was average,
184
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,720
he was quite plain, never stood out,
and never made any big mistakes
185
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,590
Nobody hated him,
and nobody liked him.
186
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,510
Even if he were to disappear
all of a sudden,
187
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,590
no one would think twice
about it the next day…
188
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,590
A very low-key profile.
189
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,590
It’s an undercover technique
that's so impressive
190
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,010
that I’d want to put it
in a Shinobi textbooks.
191
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,220
A brilliant Shinobi like him being marked
by the Anbu Black Ops so easily…
192
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,470
Don't you think that's a bit strange…?
193
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,390
That’s true…
194
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,680
And when he was trying to get away…
195
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,010
He was able to get away from
the Anbu Black Ops,
196
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,550
but they caught up to him.
197
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,600
For a trap professional,
it seems like such a lame end.
198
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,590
On top of all that, the plans
have completely disappeared.
199
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,430
It doesn’t make any sense to me.
200
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,350
And…?
201
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,010
Everything is moving
along according to his plan.
202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
It couldn’t be…?
203
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,050
His true identity being discovered,
204
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,800
and dying in front of
the Anbu Black Ops…
205
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,350
What if all of that was his plan?
206
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,720
And if he had predicted that
we would all leave the village
207
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,470
in taking precautions against
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls…
208
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,590
We could be just dancing on
the palm of his hand.
209
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,390
But if we look at all the information
we have at this point,
210
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,430
we need to be on alert for
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
211
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,100
That’s true, but…
212
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
However…
213
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,010
I don’t think the situation will
change much
214
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,590
just by sending another ten Gennin
and one Chunin…
215
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I’ll have the Shikamaru squad
continue to investigate Genno.
216
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,590
Understood.
217
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,010
Shikamaru! Choji!
218
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,850
Sorry… I didn’t mean to make you wait.
219
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,720
My head hurts…
220
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,350
Hey. Why do we have to
look through these books?
221
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,590
I don’t want to do it either.
But this is the basis of investigation.
222
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,850
But still… There’re so many numbers,
my eyes are hurting.
223
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,260
I’m sorry…
I still can’t find it .
224
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,010
I see…
225
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,430
What?
226
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,390
The old recommendation letter
that enabled them
227
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,800
to figure out that Genno’s
recommendation letter was a fake.
228
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,590
Why do you have to look for that?
229
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,470
Just a hunch…
230
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,800
Did the people of this house just lose it?
Or did he…
231
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,390
In either case,
232
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,180
he should have wanted to get rid of
233
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,590
the recommendation letter
that he brought…
234
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,430
Why would he just get rid of
the old recommendation letter?
235
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,590
This is where he took his own life…?
236
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,590
It seems that they’ve already
collected the remains.
237
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,590
It’s a job done by the Anbu Black Ops…
238
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,470
They don’t leave anything behind.
239
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,140
Everyone, come over here!
240
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,590
Look, the tree is burned on both sides!
241
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,590
The Paper Bombs exploded…
242
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,970
There should be burned marks.
243
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,430
The fact that it’s on both sides
is the problem!
244
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,100
I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,
245
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,760
it wouldn’t have left marks on both sides.
246
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,510
There would have to be
at least two explosions
247
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,010
to leave this kind of burn marks.
248
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,100
But according to the Anbu Black Ops,
249
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,010
he exploded the Paper Bombs
that were wrapped around his body.
250
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,760
But no one saw him at the moment
of the explosion…
251
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,590
There may be Anbu Black Ops,
252
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,260
but they’d still need to dodge
the explosion.
253
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,970
This one’s burned on both sides too…
254
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,100
Same on this tree too.
255
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Probably…
256
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,100
First, the Paper Bombs that
were placed on
257
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,590
the trees in the surrounding area
were blown up…
258
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,430
Then there was a huge explosion
in the center.
259
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,140
If he had set off the explosions
close to each other,
260
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,300
then it’s possible to perceive it
as one explosion!
261
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,850
I see…
262
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,890
But in order to do that,
263
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,930
he would have needed to set up
some sort of trick before hand.
264
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,300
Didn't Genno take his life
265
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,100
after being cornered by
the Anbu Black Ops?
266
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,850
What if they didn't catch up to him,
267
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,590
but rather,
he let them catch up to him?
268
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,590
So you’re saying that
he was running away
269
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,590
planning to let them
catch up to him here?!
270
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,930
It’s not impossible…
271
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,140
If that is the case…
272
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,350
It’s possible that he could
have laid other traps
273
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Could it be that…
274
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,510
the fact he killed himself with
the Paper Bombs is also…
275
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,930
It’s done.
They said you could come in.
276
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,010
Y-Yeah.
277
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,890
It’s impossible.
278
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,180
Didn’t the Anbu Black Ops make sure
with their own eyes…?
279
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Yeah.
280
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,800
There's no point in telling me
to check out the body.
281
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,430
I’m not a Medical Ninja.
282
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,930
What should I check
and how should I do it…?
283
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,050
Sakura…
284
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,590
This man… He snuck in as
a carpenter right?
285
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,550
That’s right. Is there something
that bothers you?
286
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,350
His hand… It’s too clean.
287
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,720
My family owns a flower shop,
remember?
288
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,590
I’ve been helping out
since I was a kid…
289
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,390
So if I look at a person’s hand,
I can tell what kind of job they do…
290
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,590
Carpenter’s hands are much more rough.
291
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,800
And there’s no way that a trap
professional’s hand would be so clean!
292
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,590
Then…!
293
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,260
May I?
294
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Byakugan!
295
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,550
Just as I suspected…
296
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,760
There’s no evidence that he's trained
his Chakra Network.
297
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,590
This man has never controlled
a Chakra…
298
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
What?
299
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,590
The people from the medical group
were talking over there.
300
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,760
That they have some questions
about this body…
301
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,510
This person is not a Ninja!
302
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,100
Reporting! The spearhead of
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
303
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,930
is about to reach the borders!
304
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,760
They’re fast…
What about our enforcement army?
305
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,470
They are gathering currently,
306
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,010
but they’re not in position
for battle quite yet…
307
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,010
What if they attack even before
we’re in position for battle?
308
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,430
In any case…
Who would have thought
309
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,760
that the Village Hidden in
the Waterfalls would…
310
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,050
Nothing will come of that right now.
311
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,140
Once the enemy crosses that river,
312
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,930
we will see that as their intent
to wage war on us,
313
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,350
and we will start to attack!
314
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,590
Yes!
315
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,350
Academy?
316
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,390
There were no plans for the Academy…
317
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Excuse me!
Could you help me?
318
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,510
Did you call?
319
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,140
We saw that the Academy had
made some payments last month…
320
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Last month?
321
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,430
Oh this. We did some
reparation work for the Academy.
322
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,930
We don't have the plans for that.
323
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,550
No, that’s not possible…
324
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,350
That’s strange…
Where did I put it?
325
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
What’s going on?
326
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,350
Above…?
327
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,260
What’s the matter, Naruto?
328
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,590
What’s going on?
329
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,260
They should show themselves soon…
330
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,550
Reporting! The Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls spearhead
331
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,890
that was closing in on the borders
has started to retreat!
332
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,350
What?!
333
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,010
It seems like it really was
a practice run…
334
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,140
Then where are the stolen plans?!
335
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,600
Th-This is…
336
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,800
This is Shikamaru’s…
337
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,720
These are the plans?
338
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Yeah…
339
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,850
It’s written in a complex code
so that it’s not easily deciphered.
340
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,590
But…
341
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,590
Why are the plans that were stolen
by Genno appearing here?
342
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,850
On a checkerboard night
343
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,470
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
344
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,850
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
345
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,010
Suggestively
346
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,760
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
347
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,590
The Trombone gradually going off-key
348
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,050
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
349
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,100
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
350
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,300
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
351
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,720
Students these days,
sure lack civility.
352
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,590
They usually do things like
eat potato chips, eat barbeque…
353
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,300
– Read comics.
– And eat box lunches.
354
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,430
– Is eating all you talk about?
– All that loafing?
355
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,590
Well, I mean
the self study hours are for…
356
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,180
– You know?
– No, I don’t know.
357
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,590
They devote themselves to training
even though their Sensei is not watching.
358
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,470
– Isn’t it beautiful?
– Really?
359
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,180
I am moved! I will back up
their training myself!
360
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,350
Huh?!
361
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,260
Next time: “The Missed Target”
//%
1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,580
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,490
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,120
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,620
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,370
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:46,250
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:55,490
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:06,490
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:15,830
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,000
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,290
Battle at Sea:
The Power Unleashed!!
12
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,490
So you’re a monster too!
13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,910
You’re one to be acting
you are above me!
14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,200
Take this!
15
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,450
What?!
16
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,490
Crap!
17
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,500
This is bad!
18
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,620
Naruto!
19
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
I‘m counting on you…
20
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,750
Naruto! Hang in there.
21
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,450
Naruto!
22
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,790
I-I’m okay…
23
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,120
Isaribi… Thank you.
24
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,540
Oh no!
25
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,490
I’ll take the rest of your Chakra!
26
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,830
Mind Destruction Jutsu!
27
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,080
Impossible!
28
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,620
Made it in time…
29
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,410
What?!
30
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,080
I see… It was you, huh?!
31
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,490
The nerve of you to mess with me!
32
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,370
Stop it, get away!
33
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,410
Don’t turn your back to the enemy…!
34
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,250
You forgot the ironclad rule
of the fight…
35
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,450
You lose!
36
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,370
You saved me…
37
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,450
That brat hit me with all his strength…
38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,580
And that Yoroi is no good either.
39
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,120
I caught a huge fish!
40
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,410
You mean you’re going
to escape alone?
41
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,290
We completed accommodating
all the injured soldiers.
42
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,000
Good work!
43
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,870
What’s left is…
44
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,790
Naruto and others, right?
45
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,080
Of your numerous crimes…
46
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,750
When we return to the village
justice will be served,
47
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,040
and it won’t be quick,
so prepare yourself.
48
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,000
It’s not over yet…
49
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,000
You! I haven’t hit you enough yet!
50
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,200
That’s too bad.
51
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,450
What?!
52
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,870
What…What’s going on?
53
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,490
The Sea Monster doesn’t die.
lt is immortal, that one!
54
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,660
For the Sea Monster,
this limitless seawater is its life…
55
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,620
In the end, it will be your loss!
56
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,290
Shut up!
57
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,120
Summoning Jutsu!
58
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,370
All right! I’m counting on you, Chief.
59
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,620
Go clobber that flabby guy!
60
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,120
Hey, Chief! We don’t have time
for you to be so leisurely!
61
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,750
That monster…
Whack him in one go…
62
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,490
That’s hot! Hot, hot!
63
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,370
You got no business getting
so motivated all by yourself!
64
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,620
It itches, itches and
I’m getting a rash all over my body!
65
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,450
Wait, wait.
Don’t come over here, Naruto!
66
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,540
Damn him…
67
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,490
I’m going to rip you apart
when the mission is over!
68
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,830
Remember that!
69
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,790
Naruto! How are you going
to settle this?!
70
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,490
How can you say that,
Chief Toad is the strongest frog!
71
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,200
Please don’t let something like
the saltwater bother you and fight.
72
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,490
Humph! You can’t even control
the summoned animal you called up!
73
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,120
What was that?!
74
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,250
If you don’t send him home quickly
75
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,490
the Sea Monster will gulp him down
and he’ll whither like a slug!
76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,330
A slug, he says?!
77
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,750
Hey, Naruto! I’m going to
kick your butt later…
78
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,490
Right now, I’ll help you.
79
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,830
Huh? F-For real?!
80
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,540
Don’t mess with amphibians…
81
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,450
I’ll show you my terror!
82
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,490
Yeah! Now you're talking.
83
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,490
Hang on!
84
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,540
Wh-What the…?
85
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,790
You rat… Let go of me, huh!
86
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,080
What is this? He got you, Chief Toad!
87
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,950
You be quiet!
88
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,950
Upsy!
89
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,660
This isn’t accomplishing anything…
90
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,790
What’s up with
that flabby bastard, really?
91
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,000
In short, this is some kind of monster
92
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,950
consisting of water gathered around
its spiritual body at the core.
93
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,700
Crap!
94
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,410
I don’t really know what that means,
95
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,620
but I guess I can’t do anything
about that thing.
96
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,910
Even though we pierce the monster
with a dagger all we want,
97
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,700
the monster will suck up ocean water
and come back to life…
98
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,410
Then what should we do,
Chief Toad?!
99
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,370
The only thing we can do here is
100
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,370
to somehow damage
the spiritual body at the “core.”
101
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,160
Damage…? How?
102
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,500
The opponent is a clump of water…
103
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,620
Add heat and he’ll evaporate!
104
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,290
The thoughts of fools mean nothing…
105
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,500
The only thing you can do is to
surrender to me, I who control the ocean!
106
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,290
Damn. You’re annoying.
Let’s go, Naruto!
107
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,490
What? Go? Where are you going?!
108
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,080
Airhead! I’ll spew oil!
109
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,790
Huh?
110
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,000
Light a fire with
a Fire Style Jutsu!
111
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,500
What?! I can’t do
a Fire Style Jutsu!
112
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,120
Here we go!
113
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,290
What? Fire, fire, fire!
114
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,870
How’s that?!
115
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,700
What?!
116
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,870
H-He did it… !
117
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,540
Well done!
118
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,870
Naruto…
119
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,490
Im… Impossible!
120
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,490
We did it, Chief Toad!
121
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,790
How’s that!
122
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,200
Chief Toad and me is
the strongest combination, after all!
123
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,410
Naruto! You’re in a festive mood
all by yourself,
124
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,870
though I’m wondering if
you’ve forgotten about something?
125
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,000
Huh? Forgotten what?
126
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,490
You called me to a place like this…
127
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,500
Look, now I’ve got all of
these goose bumps!
128
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,660
You’ve always had all those warts…
129
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,490
Shut up! I’ll have you
settle this properly!
130
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,620
What?! Wha--?
W-Wait Chief Toad! Wait!
131
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,120
No use talking!
132
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,160
It itches. I can’t take it!
133
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,500
Something like this doesn’t
soothe my feelings but,
134
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,500
my sons have caused you inconvenience,
so I forgive you this time.
135
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,490
See you!
136
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,410
I’m sorry, Chief Toad… Help me…
137
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,250
Now that we also got rid of
the Sea Monster, Amachi…
138
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,490
You’ll be taken to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves
139
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,490
as the principle offender of
the attacks on ships collecting funds.
140
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,000
Shame! We had got kicked
around because of you!
141
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,750
What are you doing?!
lsaribi, kill these guys!
142
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,830
I won’t!
143
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,490
Have you forgotten?
144
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,790
I am the only person who
can turn you back into a human!
145
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,250
If I continue doing this,
146
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,660
I’ll be a monster all the way
to my heart!
147
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,700
That’s right, Isaribi!
148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,870
You’re neither a human being
nor fully integrated like me.
149
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,540
The best you can do is to live
the rest of your life as a monster
150
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,950
for your whole life!
151
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,080
Well, from the very start,
152
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,490
I hadn’t thought of a way
to turn you back into a human!
153
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,490
Like I told you…
154
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,790
I was intending to dissect you!
155
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,080
No way…
156
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,790
You!
157
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,370
How rotten are you?!
158
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,080
Stop it.
159
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,160
Once we’ve returned to
the village, he’ll be punished harshly.
160
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,250
Well… It’s about time you told us.
161
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Where…did Orochimaru go?
162
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,450
You think I know something
like that?!
163
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,450
You were tossed aside
by Orochimaru.
164
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,370
It serves you right to follow
after him forever.
165
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,490
You and I are different!
166
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,660
I’ll be in charge of the research center
167
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,410
and some day, will become an entity
that’d bring Orochimaru to shame.
168
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,000
Really…
169
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,490
Just for yourself. Not fair!
170
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,490
And now, mission completed.
Let’s return to the island!
171
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,200
Not fair. I’m also slug
a good one before that.
172
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,830
Stop it!
173
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,750
That’s the Jiro Island
Amachi was talking about…
174
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,830
Here is the source of my nightmare…
175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,910
This place is where the fragments
of my missing memories is left.
176
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,160
Master Orochimaru…
What in the world did you…?
177
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,250
She’s alive…!
178
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,490
She’s a lucky girl…
179
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,490
After we tested ten,
only one survived…
180
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,290
I guess this experiment yielded
little something before I take my leave.
181
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,200
Leave…?
182
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,790
Because it looks like
there’s no reason to be here anymore…
183
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,490
But, the research is still…
184
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,200
That facility, do with it
whatever you want.
185
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,160
I have no need for it anymore…
186
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,540
– Why…? How could you do this?
– Why…? How could you do this?
187
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,490
– I always respected you, yet you…
– I always respected you, yet you…
188
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,040
You’re lacking many things.
189
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,490
Motivation to desire the “power”…
190
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,200
Tenacity…
191
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,450
Hatred…
192
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,330
Everything!
193
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,450
But, let’s see…
194
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,620
I suppose just the fact
that you survived
195
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,490
might mean you have some value…
196
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,580
Say? Do you want to come with me…?
197
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,200
I see…
198
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,660
I’ll find a better-gifted child then…
199
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,500
It connected…
200
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,490
So bright…
201
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,410
I wasn’t cast aside…
202
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,490
I, on my own…
203
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,490
by my own will… chose it!
204
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,490
Hey, hey, where did Sensei go?
205
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
When I woke up this morning
she wasn’t here…
206
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,490
Will be right back!
Anko
Leaving behind only
a note like this!
207
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,750
Seriously…
She sure is a fidgety person!
208
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,200
What did you say?
Who do you think you are?
209
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,490
Whaddya mean?!
210
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,830
What, you object?!
211
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,330
Um…
212
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,490
Really… Can I come with you?
213
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,490
Don’t worry!
214
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,950
There’s a very scary,
215
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,490
but awesome Medical Ninja
in Village Hidden in the Leaves!
216
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,700
Yes, because Lady Tsunade
is a medical specialist.
217
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,490
That’s right, Lady Tsunade is amazing!
218
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,490
Surely she’ll do something for you!
219
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,490
Relax and let us take care of it.
220
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,910
Thank you.
221
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,620
Hey, all of you!
222
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,580
What are you doing?!
The boat will leave!
223
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,370
When did you…!
224
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,370
What were you doing?!
225
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,490
We’ve been waiting for you
this whole time, Sensei.
226
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,490
Sorry, sorry…
227
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,750
Wait! We’re getting on!
228
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,080
Okay! We’re going home
to the Leaf Village!
229
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,620
No doubt, you are hyper
from the start to the finish…
230
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Do you know what being tired is?
231
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,290
Any problem?
232
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,330
I’m praising you! I appreciate it!
233
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,490
Huh? Really?
You’re embarrassing me.
234
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,200
The wind blows, Ah…
235
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,950
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
236
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,490
What should be brought along?
237
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,490
Assemble them into a piece.
238
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,540
There is no second chance, never
239
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,250
How foolish it is to throw away
240
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,490
Acting so innocently, Ah…
241
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,410
The images.
242
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,490
It probably will not end
243
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,750
It probably will not end
244
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,500
Burn that love-filled heart,
245
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,580
Sail across a thousand dreams
246
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,620
Running freely
247
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,410
To take hold of the world in hand
248
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,490
The clouds scatter
249
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,490
The sun sets yet again
250
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:36,000
The solo parade begins to move.
251
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,330
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
252
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,700
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
253
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,120
Guarding a high-profile individual.
254
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,410
Sure has a nice ring to it, believe it!
255
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,200
Yeah! A mission has finally come
that suits my ability!
256
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,040
Just you wait,
you great heir to a fortune!
257
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,490
Now that I’ve taken this on,
I’ll go through fire or water or…!
258
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,540
Hey, what’s this?!
259
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,580
Isn’t this just a D-rank mission
with babysitting?
260
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,290
Next time: “Impossible!
Celebrity Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!”
//%
1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,660
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:29,490
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,870
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,040
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,200
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:52,750
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,620
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,660
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,910
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:18,580
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:28,540
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,950
Sand Coffin!
13
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,790
I’ll do it.
14
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,490
No! Please back me up.
15
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,200
I got sand in my mouth…
16
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,500
P-Please let me go!
17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,660
You wouldn’t be able to do
anything in your current state…
18
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,870
I’ll do it.
19
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,490
Please be careful!
20
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,540
That guy attacks with bones!
21
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,040
Like earlier…
22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,290
he does things like shoot bones
and extrude bones from inside his body…
23
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,410
He controls bones freely!
24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,500
Gaara of the Desert…
25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,750
You use sand,
as the name implies, huh…?
26
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,660
Gaara vs. Kimimaro
27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,540
Tough defense using sand…
28
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,540
He…isn’t a close-range combat type…
29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,750
Getting close would be difficult, huh.
30
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,490
It's coming!
31
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,000
Digital Shrapnel!
32
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
There’s no waste in his movements…
33
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,950
Sure enough,
he’s a considerable Taijutsu user.
34
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,490
Attack and defense are one…
35
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,080
He attacks and defends
with sand, huh?
36
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,910
However, the amount of sand
he can control is probably…
37
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,000
…about the amount of sand
inside the gourd.
38
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,250
Gaara of the Desert…
A dopey nickname.
39
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,490
You can’t do anything
if you don’t have sand.
40
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,790
Going to the trouble of walking around
carrying heavy sand
41
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,950
is the very proof of that.
42
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,700
Sand Shower…
43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,490
How trite…
44
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,620
As long as I have sand,
I can do anything.
45
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,250
You’re the one who’s dopey…
46
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,490
It’s easy for me to do things
like create sand with dirt…
47
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,500
I get it…
48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,000
With his own sand he grinds things
like rocks and minerals in dirt
49
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,450
and makes it into sand.
50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,870
So he was sending his own sand
beneath the ground
51
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,500
and adding new sand, huh…?
52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,370
Gaara of the Desert…
53
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,080
His nickname isn’t just for display.
54
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,580
Excellent!
55
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,490
You did it!
56
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,490
Not yet.
57
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,200
Sand Burial!
58
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,500
I’m reminded of that man
when I look at that guy.
59
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,410
Huh?
60
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,330
Sasuke Uchiha!
61
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,250
He had the same eyes
as that guy…
62
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,700
The same eyes?
63
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,080
Wanting to verify the value
of one’s own existence…
64
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,910
Such eyes…
65
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,200
Sasuke!
66
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,490
Sasuke!
67
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,490
Sasuke.
68
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,500
You’re here, aren’t you?!
At least answer me!
69
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,490
What’s gotten into you?!
70
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,830
I don’t hate the darkness…
71
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,490
The darkness is where
I was brought up…
72
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,750
Why am I…in a place like this?
73
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,450
Did I do something wrong?
74
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,490
Is there really God…?
75
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,910
If there is, why confine me
in a place like this?
76
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,700
Who’s there?
77
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,790
It doesn’t matter who I am…
Get out!
78
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,910
Kimimaro, the time has come to use you…
79
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,290
Huh?
80
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,490
For our sake,
for the Kaguya Clan…
81
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,490
Fight!
82
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,500
Yes… To fight.
83
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,490
That is…
84
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,500
the only thing I can do now.
85
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,620
N-No way…
86
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,620
That’s quite some pressure…
87
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,250
I would’ve been flattened
just like that
88
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,490
had I not made a membrane
of bone just below the skin.
89
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,490
Bones…That guy’s a monster, too.
90
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,660
It’s a troublesome body, isn’t it?
91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500
I underestimated you…
92
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,700
But, I won’t be caught by
your sand anymore.
93
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,410
Sand Tsunami!
94
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,830
Wow… It’s beyond
the scope of
95
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,080
escaping from the sand
or not getting caught…
96
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,250
To think it would change
the terrain itself…
97
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
You…You did it.
98
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Not yet.
99
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,250
Giant Sand Burial!
100
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,490
H-He’s so strong…
101
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,120
He’s gotten even stronger
than when he fought me.
102
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,490
But…this time for sure…
103
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,490
He’s a persistent guy…
104
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,490
Huh?!
105
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,490
I’m still…alive…
106
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,250
Then… There’s still significance
for me to live.
107
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,490
From now, we’re going
to launch a night attack
108
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,700
on the Hidden Mist Village…
109
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
As they are disconcerted
from that incident,
110
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,540
now is the perfect time for us
to make them realize our ferocity!
111
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,490
Make them realize the ferocity
of the Kaguya Clan!
112
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,370
– Yeah! 					– Right!
113
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,830
What’re you doing, Kimimaro?
Get going!
114
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,290
I don’t know what to do…
115
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,160
You don’t need to think
deeply about it.
116
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,490
Go down to the Hidden Mist Village
117
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,750
and kill every last person
you encounter!
118
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,700
Just act on your instincts!
119
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?
120
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
No…
121
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,490
I-I see… Excuse me!
122
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,830
Haku?
123
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,490
Oh…no. It’s nothing, Zabuza.
124
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,750
We don’t have time to be stopping.
Let’s hurry!
125
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,660
Right!
126
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,910
He had the same eyes as I…
127
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,540
Before I met Zabuza…
128
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,580
Hold it!
129
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,410
You’re a hasty one, aren’t you?
I’m not from this village.
130
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,200
The thing you are after is right there…
131
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,330
Now, go.
132
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,490
It seems to have begun…
133
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,700
The Kaguya Clan…
134
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,790
Fools who can only find
their own path of life by fighting…
135
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,870
It was long ago
136
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,580
when a simple-minded group that
just enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.
137
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,290
With a governed organization
as an opponent,
138
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,450
they just become fools
rushing towards death
139
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,490
if they fight only with power…
140
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,490
Are we the only survivors…?
141
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,950
It seems we’re surrounded…
142
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,580
The defense was tighter
than we thought.
143
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,540
We have no choice…
144
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,540
Now it’s come to this,
145
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,200
take along with you
every person you can!
146
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,870
We’ll have them entertain us
as much as possible!
147
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,160
What do I fight for…?
148
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,370
What am I…?
149
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,040
Without knowing anything,
I just kept on fighting.
150
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,910
The time has come to use you…
151
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,750
I’m needed…
152
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,200
That was the only thing
that got my body moving.
153
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,620
And…
154
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,750
I was also able to figure out that…
155
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,410
I couldn’t live if I didn’t fight.
156
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,120
Dawn broke…
157
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,490
And I learned that…
158
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,490
I myself was the only one
to survive.
159
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,290
Again, I’m all alone…
160
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,500
By myself, I just wandered
aimlessly from place to place.
161
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,500
This is…
162
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,450
The flower, from back then…?
163
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,160
Why are you blooming
in a place like this?
164
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,490
Why won’t you answer?
165
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,080
You’re ignoring me, too, huh?!
166
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,080
There’s no way you’d be seen
by someone in a place like this, yet you…!
167
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,490
That’s enough…
168
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,620
Maybe…there’s no significance to living.
169
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,490
But you might be able to
discover something interesting
170
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,370
by continuing to live…right?
171
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,490
Like how you discovered that flower…
172
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,490
Like how I discovered you.
173
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay, Let’s go…
174
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,490
Back then…
Lord Orochimaru said that, but…
175
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,370
People are born with
some kind of significance.
176
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,410
That’s what I think…
some kind of important mission.
177
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,370
The mission for me…
178
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,160
is to protect Lord Orochimaru
and his ambition.
179
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,910
What’s…that?!
180
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,490
Come back, Sasuke!
Everyone’s worried about you!
181
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,870
Damn it…
lt’s so dark I can’t see anything!
182
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,870
You’ve got better eyes than me.
183
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,500
Sasuke is in the darkness now…
184
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,410
N-Neji?!
185
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,750
You’ll be unable to catch up
with Sasuke
186
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,790
if you stop in a place like this…
187
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
Neji!
188
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Yeah… You’re right!
This isn’t the time to stop.
189
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Just wait! I’ll take Sasuke
back home no matter what!
190
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,870
Sasuke!
191
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,540
Sand Coffin!
192
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,160
That form…?!
193
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,160
For the first time, I spoke to you
194
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,290
And you smiled
195
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,700
For the first time, I was able to speak
196
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,490
In my own words
197
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,250
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
198
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,660
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
199
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:52,490
My clumsy attempts with words
200
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,160
You listened without turning away
201
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,450
No wonder I get carried away by you
202
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:11,490
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
203
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,540
I feel so sad
204
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,500
But…
205
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,080
For the first time, I spoke to you
206
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,120
And you smiled
207
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,790
For the first time, I was able to speak
208
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,870
In my own words
209
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,490
For the first time, I spoke to you
210
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,500
And you smiled
211
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,160
For the first time, I was able to speak
212
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,120
In my own words
213
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,660
For the first time, I spoke to you
214
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,490
I’m saved. That’s excellent.
215
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,200
To think you could do such a thing!
216
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,490
He was persistent,
but this is the end…
184.01	01:47:58:14	01:48:00:16	He’ll never come out again.
217
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,490
Brainwashed by Orochimaru…
218
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,910
It’s not brainwashing!
That person understands me!
219
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,330
What do you guys know?!
220
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,410
Next episode,
“Vengeful Strike! The Bracken Dance!”
//%
1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,700
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,450
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,250
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,490
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,580
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,040
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,490
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,000
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,450
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,450
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,660
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,330
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,160
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,790
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,250
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,080
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,410
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,830
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,370
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,620
For a Friend!
21
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,580
What did you say?!
22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,750
You mean to say that only rookies
went after Sasuke?!
23
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,490
It really couldn’t be helped…
24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,370
the situation in
the Village being how it is…
25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,330
And anyway…
26
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,200
I’ve taken the minimally
required measures.
27
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,490
Hey, hey!
28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,490
Your mission has already
been assigned!
29
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,490
Uh, I’m gonna go do an errand
and will be back shortly…
30
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,870
Don't worry.
31
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,250
Geez…
32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,290
Kakashi Sensei!
33
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,290
Kakashi Sensei!
34
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,410
It’s already been two days
since Sasuke left the village…
35
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,540
And Naruto and the others who went in
pursuit haven’t come back either.
36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,830
And neither has Lee…
37
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,490
I know. I’ve more or less
heard the whole story.
38
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,330
I…believe in Naruto!
39
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,000
I believe him, but if something were
to happen to Naruto and Sasuke…
40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,580
Sakura, you don’t need to
worry about anything.
41
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,160
Leave this to me.
42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,490
Summoning Jutsu!
43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,540
First of all, I want you guys to
fan out in all directions
44
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,080
in pursuit of Naruto
and Sasuke’s scent.
45
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,910
Naruto and Sasuke you said?
46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,620
Did something happen
to the two of them?
47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,700
I’ll explain later…
Right now, time is of essence.
48
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,580
Okay.
49
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,490
As soon as you confirm that
you’ve detected the scent,
50
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,490
call me and I’ll be there immediately.
51
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,950
All right! Scatter!
52
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,490
Well, I guess since she saw them
fight before her very eyes…
53
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,120
it’s useless to tell her
not to worry.
54
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,200
Stop!
55
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,290
Damn…
56
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,200
I can’t stop…
57
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,580
Sasuke… Stop with revenge.
58
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,660
What?!
59
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,290
Even if you were successful
in carrying out your revenge,
60
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,040
all that will come out of it
is a sense of emptiness.
61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,450
Shut up!
62
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,200
What do you know?!
63
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,490
Don’t say that so knowingly!
64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,700
Well…calm down.
65
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,490
Neither you nor I could
call ourselves lucky.
66
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,540
Of that much I'm certain.
67
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,290
But it could be worse.
68
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,120
Both you and I have found
precious comrades, right?
69
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,410
We understand that all the more
because we’ve lost them once.
70
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,040
I taught you Chidori
71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,490
because you now have
precious people.
72
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,370
That power isn’t something to be used
against your comrades or for revenge.
73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,490
You know what that power
should be used for.
74
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,830
I’m gonna win no matter what!
75
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,790
Don’t get so carried away!
76
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,290
I was too naïve…
77
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,290
Watching them, they might actually
be intent on killing each other…
78
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,000
Kakashi Sensei…
79
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,500
Please let me get there
in time!
80
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,790
I already said this earlier but…
81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
In truth, you were waiting
for this too, weren’t you?
82
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,910
Neither Kakashi nor Sakura
are present right now.
83
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,490
So there’s nobody here to stop us
like that time before.
84
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,450
You…!
85
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,250
This time around we’re gonna
settle this for real!
86
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,790
I will take you down!
87
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
Chidori!
88
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,910
You idiot…
89
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,490
Same here!
I’m gonna clobber you…
90
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,290
and take you back home even
if I have to drag you!
91
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,830
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
92
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,700
Rasengan!
93
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,950
It wasn’t meaningless…
94
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,490
To me, you became
my closest friend.
95
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,540
Sasuke actually came out
and said that…to me…
96
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,870
And that’s exactly the reason why
I wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.
97
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,080
Damn…
98
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,490
Damn you!
99
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,330
Damn…
100
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,700
He was able to counter
101
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,790
my full power of Chidori
to that extent…
102
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,120
That jutsu…
103
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,490
Damn…
104
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,370
Naruto, to what extent…!
105
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,290
That loser…
106
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,040
Naruto…!
107
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,490
Well, your limit is two blows…
that’s about it.
108
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,620
And if I try to use more than that…
109
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,490
what will happen?
110
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,490
The third blow won’t initiate.
111
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,490
Remember that well.
112
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,410
If you try to initiate
the Jutsu forcibly…
113
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,790
not only will the Art not
initiate properly,
114
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,870
but your Chakra will become zero…
115
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,370
In the worst case scenario
it will cost you your life!
116
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,660
Damn… I can’t waste a blow…
117
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,250
It wouldn’t serve any purpose
if we cancel each other like earlier.
118
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,540
There’s…no longer
any mistake about this.
119
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,490
You…really intended…
120
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,830
You really intended to…
121
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,490
Sasuke…!
122
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,290
I will use numerous speedy techniques
and Jutsu to create an opening.
123
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,540
And then…I will make
a hit with Chidori.
124
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,830
Sasuke…
125
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,870
Did you know, Naruto…
126
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,660
Top-class Ninja should be
able to read each other‘s hearts
127
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,490
simply by an exchange of fists.
128
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,040
Even without saying anything…
129
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,490
You’re naïve, Naruto.
130
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,370
How about it?
131
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,040
Were you really able
to read inside…
132
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,200
this heart of mine?
133
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,580
Fire Style:
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
134
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,490
Sasuke… I knew that you
were always alone.
135
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,490
At first, I was relieved
when I found out
136
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,040
that there was
a guy similar to myself.
137
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,200
And it also made me happy…
138
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,500
To tell the truth, I really wanted
to approach you right away.
139
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,910
But…I wasn’t able to approach you…
140
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,290
– Awesome…
– You’re incredible…
141
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,490
You were always able
to do everything.
142
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,160
And moreover, you were always
being praised by everyone.
143
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,160
Because you and I
were so different…
144
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,830
Because I didn’t want to admit it,
I decided to call you my rival.
145
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,250
I didn’t want to lose to you…
146
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,080
and I felt that even more strongly…
147
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,490
because I was called a loser.
148
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,490
Even when we were
in the Squad Seven,
149
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,830
I continued to feel
the same way the whole time.
150
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,410
I’m stubborn…
151
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,490
And wasn’t able to express
what I really felt…
152
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,490
What I really wanted was
to become like you.
153
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,870
You were what I aspired to…so…
154
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,040
You are one of the ones
I want to fight.
155
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,250
I was really happy when
you said that!
156
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,790
Those were your first words…
acknowledging me…
157
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,660
You and I both knew,
158
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,700
without us even having to
have an exchange of fists!
159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,490
From that time on…
160
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,160
Even without saying anything…
161
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,490
The fact that…
162
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,040
we are friends!
163
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,540
It’s not without meaning…
164
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,490
To me you’re…
165
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,490
my closest friend.
166
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,540
However…you’re trying to
take me down for real.
167
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,950
Right now, I don’t really know
168
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,700
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not.
169
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,580
Thinking that we were friends…
170
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,620
That might have been…
171
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,660
That might have been just me…
172
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,160
It’s too late now!
173
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,000
Naruto!
174
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,490
If that’s the case…I’m…
175
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,490
really lame, aren’t I…
176
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,290
Sasuke!
177
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,700
But…
178
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,490
It can’t be helped, can it?
179
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,040
I don’t know why but…
180
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,490
I don’t know why…
181
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,490
But I…
182
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,290
I…
183
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,200
don't want you…
184
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,790
you to be taken away
by someone like Orochimaru!
185
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,870
You managed to divert it
with your left hand,
186
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,490
but it was meaningless.
187
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,290
You won't be able to use
any hand sign
188
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,490
or that Jutsu earlier anymore.
189
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,750
This is the end!
190
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,490
Wh-What’s…
191
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,620
that red Chakra…?
192
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,490
Where does he get that
kind of power from?!
193
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,620
W-What the heck…is this?!
194
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,490
His shoulder injury is healing…
195
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,490
That’s unbelievable!
196
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:04,370
Sasuke! I’m not gonna let
Orochimaru take you away!
197
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,750
I will stop you,
198
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,200
even if I have to break every bone
in your arms and legs!
199
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,410
When I recalled the parts one by one,
200
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,620
I felt as though
I had understood everything
201
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:46,330
Faded words which I kept so close to me
202
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:56,040
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
203
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,790
and this distant yearning for you
204
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:12,160
I live, simply repeating this cycle
205
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:23,790
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
206
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:34,330
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
207
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,000
I’ll keep these thoughts…
208
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,200
Don’t you talk stupid like that!
209
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,160
I don’t care what
you’re thinking anymore!
210
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,250
I won’t let you go to Orochimaru’s
place no matter what!
211
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,290
I’m taking you back to the village
even if I have to drag you there!
212
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,430
Sasuke! You’re my…
213
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,200
Next episode: “A Plea From a Friend"
//%
1
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:21,390
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,230
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,770
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,390
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,020
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:45,900
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:55,350
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:06,150
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:15,480
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,650
What were you gazing at?
10.01	02:16:42:06	02:16:46:02	                  When Egrets Flap Their Wings
11
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,350
What’s this?
12
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,270
Where does this water…?
13
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,350
What’s the matter, Naruto?!
14
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,900
Get a hold of yourself, please!
15
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,690
Naruto!
16
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,390
They all look like they’re having fun.
17
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,100
Naruto!
18
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,690
Naruto…
19
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,940
Hey, you jerk…
20
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,150
This is…that lake from before…
21
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,100
Naruto…
22
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,060
I see…
23
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,850
The person who was calling my name
earlier was you, right, Chishima?
24
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,480
Are you hurt?
25
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,390
I should be asking you that, Chishima.
26
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,190
You shouldn’t be moving
with that injury.
27
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,730
I’m fine.
28
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,390
More importantly,
we need to find Lady Toki.
29
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,770
Oh yeah, that’s right…
30
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,520
Where the hell did that Moso go?
31
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,390
I’m right here…
32
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,060
Moso…!
33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Lady Toki…!
34
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,060
Chishima, I’m sorry for having
deceived you for so long…
35
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,060
That’s all right, I already had
a sense that maybe…
36
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,440
You guys know too many
of this land’s secrets…
37
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,480
I’ll have you guys embrace those secrets
as you plunge headfirst into hell…
38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Is that your real face?
39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,480
My name is Hoki.
40
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,390
I’m a Wandering Ninja.
41
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,020
I’m not about to let you get in
the way of my taking this peaceful land,
42
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,060
which I have finally managed to snatch!
43
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,440
Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
44
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Chishima!
45
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,400
Chishima!
46
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,350
Please, hang in there!
47
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,060
Are you…all right?
48
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,020
I’m so relieved…
49
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,940
Chishima!
50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Lady Toki…
51
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,850
I have fond memories…
52
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,520
of playing here at this lake…
53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,390
with you and Lord Sagi.
54
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,350
In those days,
55
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,560
the Land of Bird was tranquil,
gentle and warm…
56
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,390
Use your strength, Lady Toki…
to restore the Land of Birds…
57
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,730
to the way it was in those days…
58
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
Chishima…
59
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,390
Hang in there!
60
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,810
Naruto, I beg you…
61
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,480
help Lady Toki…
help my friend…
62
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,690
Sure thing.
lf a Leaf Ninja promises something,
63
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,770
he will complete it to the very end.
64
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,400
Promise me…
65
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,690
You must…
you must… protect Lady Toki…
66
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,390
You have feelings for her, don’t you?
67
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,480
That ramen…was delicious…
68
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,310
I’ll treat you to some again…
69
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,650
Thank you… Naruto…
70
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Chishima!
71
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
Chishima!
72
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,020
Chishima…!
73
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,730
That guy was nothing more
74
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,850
than just another
convenient servant, after all.
75
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,020
Shut up!
76
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,390
He loved the Land of Birds
with all his might…
77
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,770
Chishima, who staked his life trying
to protect the country he loved…
78
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,390
I will not…forgive you,
no matter what!
79
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,690
You may say that
you won’t forgive me,
80
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,060
but what exactly do
you think you can do?!
81
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,730
Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu!
82
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,810
Die!
83
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,690
How annoyingly persistent!
84
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,940
Gentle Fist!
85
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,310
That was careless,
Copy Ninja Kakashi Hatake…
86
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,480
The reputation of the Wandering Ninja
will be upgraded
87
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,980
if I take you, who possess
the Sharingan, down…
88
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,390
What…? A Substitution…
89
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,190
Sorry to disappoint you.
90
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,650
I don’t need to use the Sharingan
on the likes of you…
91
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,390
This way!
92
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,390
Naruto!
93
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,520
If we follow this…
94
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,100
Yes, we should be able
to reach Naruto.
95
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,390
Unfortunately, I cannot allow you
to avenge the blood of the fallen.
96
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,390
The least I can do for you,
out of charity,
97
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,900
is send you to the same place
your father and brother are.
98
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,390
I don’t care.
99
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,350
Why don’t you just kill me
in one stroke?
100
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,190
You know when to give up, huh?
101
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,600
They’re all dead.
I’m the only one left in this world.
102
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,270
Now that I am unable to take revenge,
103
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,440
I have no more reason to live.
104
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,650
You’re a courageous girl,
aren’t you?
105
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,390
All right, I’ll grant your wish.
106
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,600
Resign yourself!
107
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,480
Wake up.
108
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,440
Save Toki… Save my little sister…
109
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,060
I entrusted the future of
the Land of Birds to my younger sister
110
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,600
and gave her the watch.
111
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,980
But Toki became obsessed
with her desire for revenge.
112
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,730
I, a dead soul, cannot change
my younger sister’s heart
113
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,600
which is stalled in time.
114
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,560
I’m begging you,
115
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,310
please make my younger sister’s time
begin to move again towards the future.
116
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,590
What was that just now?
117
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,590
Die!
118
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,430
What?
119
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,010
Hold it!
120
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,590
What?
121
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,010
Hold it!
122
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,890
Naruto!
123
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,640
I met your elder brother in
a dream a little while ago.
124
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,590
Elder Brother?
125
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,930
It wasn’t the wish of
your elder brother Sagi
126
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,590
that you avenge his death.
127
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,180
He wanted to leave the care
of this land in your hands.
128
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,590
But…
129
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,300
For Chishima’s sake too…
130
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,590
you must make this
Land of Bird a great country…
131
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,890
That’s why you must live, Toki…
132
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,760
Naruto…
133
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,970
It doesn’t make any difference to me.
134
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,600
The two of you are going
to die here in any case.
135
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,050
Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?
136
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,720
What…
137
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,550
But a person with an impure heart,
with a heart bent on revenge,
138
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,350
cannot govern this land.
139
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,720
The reason this was such
a wonderful country was because
140
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,350
Chishima and Sagi and Toki’s hearts
were all connected.
141
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,590
Even if you use dirty tricks
to gain status,
142
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,470
you will never be able to control
the hearts of the people…
143
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,260
Speak for yourself, squirt!
144
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,590
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
145
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,390
You Leaf Village greenhorn!
146
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,590
I’ll send you down into hell first
to meet up with the others!
147
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,050
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
148
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,100
– It ain’t gonna be that easy!
– It ain’t gonna be that easy!
149
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,350
– Then try to spot the real McCoy!
– Then try to spot the real McCoy!
150
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,930
What…!
151
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,600
Let’s go!
152
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,930
– Damn, which is the real one?
– Damn, which is the real one?
153
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,850
Naruto, hang in there…
154
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,550
I wouldn’t have thought the real McCoy
would come straight out
155
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,010
when using Shadow Clones…
156
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,970
I was hoping you’d let me
have some fun…
157
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,350
So that was your caliber,
after all, huh.
158
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,220
Those without power should
hurry up and die!
159
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,850
Better not underestimate me!
The battle is not yet won!
160
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,850
You impertinent little…!
161
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,590
Now!
162
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,590
U-zu-ma-ki…
163
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,390
The real McCoy is…
164
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,590
Over here!
165
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,590
Uzumaki Barrage!
166
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,970
I did it!
167
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,350
Chishima!
168
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,850
Chishima…
169
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,510
Don’t die, Chishima!
170
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,510
Don’t…leave me…all alone!
171
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,350
Open your eyes…
172
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,680
Please!
173
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,590
Lady Toki…
174
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Chishima…!
175
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,430
Lady Toki…
176
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,590
I’m so relieved!
177
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,300
Thank you, Naruto!
178
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,470
I was just carrying out my mission.
179
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,590
More importantly…
180
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,140
Make that guy pay dearly for
his crimes, okay.
181
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,010
Yes.
182
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,800
I’m sure that Sagi is happy
about this too.
183
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,590
You met…you met Elder Brother Sagi…
184
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,640
Yeah, in a dream.
185
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,930
But even if it was in a dream,
186
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,300
it doesn’t change the fact that
he asked me to do something.
187
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,930
What did Elder Brother say to you?
188
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,510
Well, he said something about
starting up your time again.
189
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,470
My time?
190
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,680
He said he wanted you to forget
about things like revenge
191
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,590
and instead live for the future.
192
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,930
Elder Brother…
193
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,760
Hey!
194
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,470
Naruto…
195
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,760
Kakashi Sensei, Neji, Tenten!
196
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,300
Gimme a break…
197
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,760
I can’t get paid my extra money
now that Moso,
198
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,220
the guy who signs the paycheck,
got nabbed…
199
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,510
Come on, resign yourself…
200
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,590
But…
201
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,390
It looks like the Wandering Ninja
are going to get a really stiff sentence.
202
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,720
Yeah… And Toki was finally able to
break the curse of seeking revenge…
203
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,260
Hey, it’s gonna start!
204
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,800
Down on your knees!
205
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,680
Ohhh…wow…
206
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,600
I must apologize for having
deceived everyone
207
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,590
by using my brother’s name fraudulently,
208
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,640
and claiming
the title of feudal lord.
209
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,640
In a case such as this,
210
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,590
it may well be proper to hand over
the title of feudal lord to someone else.
211
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,590
However, if you will forgive me,
212
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,300
I would like to ask you to
allow me to work
213
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,180
on behalf of Land of Birds
as your lord.
214
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,260
For my deceased father Owashi,
and brother Sagi…
215
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,260
And for my dear friend Chishima
who loves this country so dearly…
216
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,590
Lady Toki…
217
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,680
As long as there is breath in my body,
218
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,850
I would like to work positively
to rebuild this country.
219
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,680
She’s doing an excellent job, isn’t she?
220
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,430
Toki, awesome!
221
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,720
As you wish, Lady Toki…
222
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,300
It appears that
you all agree too, correct?
223
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,590
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
224
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,760
Thank you…
225
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,590
To Komei…for accepting me
as your feudal lord…to everyone…
226
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,430
And to the young Ninja who taught me
227
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,600
what it is that I should really
stake my life on…
228
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,590
You’re embarrassing me…
229
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,180
Land of Birds
230
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,550
Please take the best of care
along the road now.
231
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,640
Fare thee well.
232
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,720
Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?
233
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,590
Thank you, Naruto.
234
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,180
Please come back to visit
again soon.
235
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,180
Sure, next time I’d love
to visit without a mission.
236
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Goodbye.
237
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,180
Goodbye. Be well…
238
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,260
See you…
239
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,470
Toki…she was really kind
and gorgeous too, wasn’t she?
240
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,850
I’m certain that the Land of Birds
will become a wonderful land again,
241
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,260
just like it was in the old days.
242
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,180
Yeah.
243
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,590
By the way, Naruto…
did you really meet Sagi’s ghost?
244
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,640
You gotta be kidding.
245
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,390
There’s no such things as ghosts…
that was all in a dream.
246
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,390
I’m not so sure it was just a dream.
247
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,800
Wh-What the heck are you
talking about?!
248
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,350
Do you remember that Cursed Warrior
we cornered the very first time?
249
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,510
Uh, yeah.
250
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,680
Yeah, he was empty inside.
251
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,300
Th-This…?
252
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,600
The inside of it is empty.
253
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,890
Yeah, but that was just sort
of gimmick, right?
254
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,470
Some kind of string or piece
of wire or something…
255
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,760
No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.
256
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,010
Now that you mention it,
257
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,050
you said there was no sign of life,
right, Neji?
258
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,010
Yeah…I didn’t feel a speck of life
from that Cursed Warrior.
259
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,140
In other words, there was
a ghost there.
260
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,390
So that was a real ghost, after all?!
261
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,220
Calm down, Naruto.
262
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,590
That's not true…
That's not true!
263
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,590
Tell me that’s not true!
264
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,300
The wind blows, Ah…
265
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,050
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
266
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,590
What should be brought along?
267
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,590
Assemble them into a piece.
268
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,640
There is no second chance, never
269
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,350
How foolish it is to throw away
270
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
271
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,510
The images.
272
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,590
It probably will not end
273
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,850
It probably will not end
274
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,600
Burn that love-filled heart,
275
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,680
Sail across a thousand dreams
276
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,720
Running freely
277
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,510
To take hold of the world in hand
278
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
The clouds scatter
279
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,590
The sun sets yet again
280
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,100
The solo parade begins to move.
281
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,430
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
282
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,800
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
283
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,590
– Pork! 					– Chicken!
284
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,100
– Beef!
– What, is this a guessing game?
285
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,140
– Bean sprouts! 					– Spinach!
286
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,640
– Green onions!
– I got it! It’s Stir-fried Beef & Vegetables!
287
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,590
– Egg! 					– Nori!
288
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,350
Seaweed!
289
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,390
Umm…Stir-fried Beef, vegetable,
and seaweed in egg sauté?!
290
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,350
– Menma! 					– Char-siu!
291
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,890
Naruto!
292
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,890
I got it, ramen!
lt’s ramen, isn’t it?!
293
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,590
Wrong answer!
294
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,720
Sakura, you’re so slow to get it!
295
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,590
You should know
if we’ve said it this far.
296
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,180
Miso-tonkotsu ramen with char-siu
and eggs on top.
297
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,970
Isn’t that right?!
298
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,680
Like heck I’d get it, Cha!
299
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,550
Next time:
“Mix It! Stretch it! Boil it up!
Burn Copper Pot! Burn!”
//%
1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:14,030
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,680
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,660
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,400
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,970
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,010
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,060
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,300
Our two hearts
11
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,560
This is my chance to show my master
the fruits of my training!
12
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,920
They're both caught in a Genjutsu…
13
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,130
Yakumo?
14
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,170
Is that you, Yakumo?
15
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,050
So you were safe!
16
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,430
Help me!
17
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,560
It’s okay now, Yakumo.
18
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,940
I’ll protect you, no matter what!
19
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,670
Kurenai Sensei!
20
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,520
Kurenai's Top-Secret Mission:
The Promise with the Third Hokage
21
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,920
The two who went in first
haven’t come back, huh?
22
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,190
Sure enough, is Yakumo in
a state of awakening?
23
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
You two handle
Yakumo and Kurenai…
24
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,560
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
25
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,170
You handle the nuisance
that’s heading this way.
26
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,100
Yes, sir!
27
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,020
What?!
28
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
Leave it to me…
29
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
That emblem…!
30
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,560
You’re with the Kurama Clan…?!
31
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,540
Yuhi Kurenai…
Hand over Yakumo quietly.
32
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,670
What does the Kurama Clan
plan to do with Yakumo?!
33
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,340
This is a clan issue.
34
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,540
It doesn’t concern you.
35
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,250
Yakumo is the child I’ve
taken custody of,
36
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,550
from the Third Hokage.
37
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,180
Then, by force…
38
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,060
No!
39
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,210
You can’t escape now!
40
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,710
What’s this?!
41
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,980
To think she’d make it look like
she got caught in a Genjutsu
42
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,550
and then trap us in
a Genjutsu…!
43
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,720
Damn it! Where’d she go…?
44
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
It hurts…
45
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
You okay…?!
46
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,190
Wha--?!
47
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,550
You jerk!
48
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,050
Oh, Naruto!
49
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,550
– Hey! Hold it. 					– H-Hey!
50
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,220
Take this!
51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,590
What?!
52
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,560
Ow-ow… Hm?!
53
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,340
This bean stalk is too damn big!
54
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,890
I-I can’t move…!
55
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,390
This is not good!
56
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,760
Naruto!
57
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,700
Die!
58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,260
Shino!
59
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,900
What?!
60
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,700
Genjutsu doesn’t work
on the insects…
61
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,010
Damn it.
62
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,070
Wh-What…?!
63
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,390
He vanished?!
64
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,560
There!
65
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,800
No matter where you hide,
you can’t cover up your scent!
66
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Man-Beast Clone!
67
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Fang Over Fang!
68
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,580
Yes!
69
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,480
Severe Leaf Hurricane!
70
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,560
No chance a half-baked Genjutsu would
work on us fully trained Ninja!
71
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Stop!
72
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,960
– Huh?
– Let go, let go! Let me go!
73
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,560
Jeez!
74
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,130
– Naruto! 					– Let go!
75
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,730
Release!
76
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,640
What?! Sakura…
77
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,850
Morning…
78
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,550
It’s because you charge right
into an enemy’s Jutsu on your own.
79
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,080
Oh! Kurenai Sensei and Yakumo?!
80
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,390
Kurenai Sensei!
81
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,860
Who’re these people?!
82
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,440
All four of them have been caught in
a Genjutsu and are unconscious.
83
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,610
Kurenai Sensei!
84
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,540
S-Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
85
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,810
She’s nowhere to be found!
86
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,820
Byakugan!
87
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,860
What is it?!
88
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,890
K-Kurenai Sensei has…
89
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,470
There's one left…
90
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,450
Just like that…
To think they’d cast a Genjutsu on me.
91
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,810
Release!
92
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,650
What?! It won’t wear off?!
93
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,430
It’s Unkai who served as
the replacement leader
94
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,570
of the Kurama Clan
after my father died.
95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,540
Unkai from the Kurama Clan…
I see.
96
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,710
Things won’t go as they did
with the others, eh?
97
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,550
Kurenai Yuhi, Genjutsu user.
98
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,210
I’m embarrassed to be praised by you…
99
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,550
I’d like to avoid needless battle.
100
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,090
Hand over Yakumo.
101
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,930
Hang on tight.
102
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,990
You may very well be
Kurenai Yuhi,
103
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,600
but how do you intent
to fight within my Jutsu?!
104
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,210
Oh, no!
105
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,250
Damn you!
106
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,550
I smell blood!
107
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,190
Heh. I won’t let you escape…
108
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,900
There!
109
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,640
Next, I’ll pierce your heart…
110
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,810
Hand over Yakumo.
Why do you protect her?!
111
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,360
Kurenai Sensei!
112
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,470
I won’t let you touch Kurenai Sensei!
113
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,540
Look out!
114
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,180
Wha--?! Not again!
115
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,880
Geez, when will you
ever learn, Naruto?!
116
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,550
Byakugan!
117
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,160
Naruto! The enemy’s above you!
118
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,860
Huh?!
119
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,000
Byakugan, huh?!
120
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
If you’re coming at me
with Genjutsu, then…
121
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,770
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
122
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,570
Go!
123
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,210
Clones, huh?!
124
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,550
Heh! Mine aren’t just illusions.
125
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,550
Let’s go!
126
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,480
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
127
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,560
U-zu-ma-ki!
128
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,730
Naruto Barrage!
129
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,570
I’ll definitely get Yakumo…
130
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,980
Byakugan!
131
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,400
Yakumo has been sedated to calm
her nerves and is asleep now.
132
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,770
But it would be best for her
133
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,740
to have a complete examination
back at the village hospital.
134
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,440
It was a big help having
you here, Sakura.
135
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,540
You should also get
some first-aid treatment, Sensei.
136
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,540
Right… Thanks.
137
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,250
Okay, please show me.
138
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,890
They’ve been like this the whole time.
139
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,960
It doesn’t look like they’ll wake up
from the Genjutsu
140
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,360
for quite a while…
141
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,130
Well, I guess that serves
our interests better. Hm?
142
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,430
It’s…!
143
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,940
Kurenai Sensei!
144
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,110
Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!
145
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,180
Y-Yes…
146
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,980
She’s not okay!
147
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,020
Wha--?!
148
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,560
I gave her some first-aid treatment,
but she has a deep wound.
149
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,120
We must get back to the village quickly…
150
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,030
Don’t worry about me.
151
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,460
I’m more concerned about
Yakumo’s instability.
152
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,570
Yeah, their comrades could
very well return.
153
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,230
I’m also concerned about
154
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,470
how we haven’t seen the three people
who were assigned to guard Yakumo.
155
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,570
All right!
156
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,610
Leave this to me and all of you
head back to the village
157
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,310
with Kurenai and Yakumo!
158
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,550
Organize a back-up unit.
159
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,550
Your opponents are practitioners
of Genjutsu.
160
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,550
Will you be okay alone?
161
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,390
What?
162
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,660
This fully…
163
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,560
…trained body!
164
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,430
I would cram by the likes
of the Kurama Clan’s Genjutsu!
165
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,900
A pun?
166
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,550
Oh?
167
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,750
Are you awake?
168
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:42,190
Hey, do you resent Kurenai Sensei
for sealing your Genjutsu?!
169
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,460
That person hates me…
170
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,540
She didn’t want to make me into
a practitioner of Genjutsu.
171
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,010
It’s not like that!
172
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,370
Then…why?!
173
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,640
I’m sure she had some kind
of reason!
174
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,550
You would’ve been in trouble
had Kurenai Sensei
175
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,320
not risked her life to save you before!
176
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,690
That was the Kurama Clan…
People from the same clan as me.
177
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,890
What?
178
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,030
Why would people
from the same clan as you…?
179
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,470
Kiba, could you take Kurenai Sensei
back to the village?
180
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,210
I’m fine…
I can at least do that myself.
181
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,280
Kiba?!
182
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,340
Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!
183
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,150
Tell us the truth!
184
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,350
Isn’t this incident and you
quitting our squad…
185
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,320
somehow related?
186
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,930
The Kurama Clan into
which Yakumo was born…
187
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,570
was once a force in
the Village Hidden in the Leaves
188
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,900
as a family of Genjutsu users.
189
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,670
However, they had been brought
to ruin in recent years,
190
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,010
unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.
191
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,850
Then a rising star brimming with
talent appeared in the clan.
192
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
And that was Yakumo.
193
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,550
My parents and relatives placed
their hopes in me,
194
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,820
the only daughter of
the head family.
195
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,600
But I was in poor health and
my official entrance into the Academy
196
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,760
was not acknowledged.
197
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,840
I had wanted to live up
to the expectations
198
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,000
of my parents and the clan…
199
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,570
and I got really depressed.
200
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,550
My father saw me like that
201
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,850
and negotiated directly with
the Third Hokage for me.
202
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,920
The Third Hokage whom
Murakumo consulted
203
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,890
realized the high level of
Yakumo’s latent power
204
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,760
and decided to leave her
in my custody.
205
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,570
By the order of the Third Hokage,
206
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,140
Kurenai Sensei became
my personal teacher.
207
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,540
But…
208
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,510
Y-Yakumo?!
209
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,250
Kurenai Sensei… She…!
210
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,250
Why?!
211
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,560
I don't know.
212
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,690
Maybe since I’m a Genjutsu user too,
213
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,300
I got jealous of the high level
of Yakumo’s latent powers.
214
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Jealous…?!
215
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,600
Genjutsu practitioners with
higher powers than mine
216
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,940
are not necessary in this village.
217
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,640
No way. You’d do that for
a reason like that…?
218
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,770
You understand, don’t you?
219
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,940
A selfish person like me can’t continue
to go on missions
220
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,550
with your lives entrusted to me.
221
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,720
I can’t believe that!
222
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,160
It’s not just her…
I’m a hindrance to the Leaf Village.
223
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,120
Wh-What do you mean?
224
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,030
I just can’t believe it.
225
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,930
Isn’t Kurenai Sensei still hiding
something from us…?
226
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,100
I also…get that feeling.
227
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,900
Exactly.
228
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,010
It’s because…
229
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,540
Kurenai Sensei’s hand shook
with heartache
230
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,210
when she talked about events
in the past.
231
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,050
But the shaking stopped…
when she talked about her motive.
232
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,220
What do you mean?
233
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,090
That motive is a lie.
234
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,560
The heart is not affected by
a made-up story.
235
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,430
Then her being jealous of Yakumo…
236
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,600
Perhaps she’s protecting someone.
237
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,970
Someone so important
Kurenai Sensei would protect?
238
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,340
That would be, for example…
239
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,020
I overheard Kurenai Sensei
and the Third Hokage talking.
240
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,560
Yakumo’s powers probably
will not awaken for a long while.
241
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,540
I see. But the time will eventually come
242
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,300
when the dam bursts and
her powers will pour out.
243
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,540
That power of the Kurama Clan
will eventually threaten
244
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,880
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
245
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,350
At that time,
we’ll have to eliminate it.
246
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,500
Even the Third Hokage was
involved with the sealing of my powers.
247
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,570
The Third Hokage would
never order something like that!
248
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,540
My parents died just before
249
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,970
I started training under
Kurenai Sensei.
250
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,510
There was a sudden fire.
251
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,850
It seems the fire spread quickly
and they couldn’t be saved…
252
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,890
But my parents were even Jonin!
253
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,220
To think they would die
just in a fire.
254
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,560
And a fire in broad daylight
on top of that…
255
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,560
And after that, although I was told
there was no foul play…
256
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,430
the autopsy reports were
classified and sealed.
257
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,540
No way?!
lt wasn’t just an ordinary fire?
258
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,710
My parents were killed on
order of the Third Hokage…!
259
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,220
No way…!
No way could that ever be true!
260
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,430
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
261
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,600
Will always be smiling right near by
262
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,540
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
263
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,110
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
264
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,020
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
265
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,860
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
266
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,800
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
267
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,170
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
268
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
269
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:15,010
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
270
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,880
The wind is probably testing our hearts
271
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,220
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
272
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,390
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
273
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,230
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
274
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,830
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
275
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,010
Will always be smiling right near by
276
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,350
The story I heard from the girl.
277
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,220
The story I heard from
Kurenai Sensei.
278
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,460
Which one is true?
lt’s unlikely that they’re all lying.
279
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,560
But I can say this.
280
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,560
There’s no way the Third Hokage
would think about eliminating the girl.
281
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,900
For the time being,
282
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,900
I’ve got to get Sensei and
the others to the hospital quick--!
283
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,670
What’s this?!
284
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,140
Next time: “Genjutsu or Reality?”
//%
1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:13,930
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,610
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,300
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,900
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,960
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,230
Our two hearts
11
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,650
Who are you guys?
12
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,220
They want to fight, it seems.
13
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,070
I won’t be fooled. 					You…you…
14
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,710
Todoroki!
15
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,020
Stop it, Todoroki!
16
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,890
You said you were going to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital, right?
17
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,970
This guy… There’s no way
I’ll forgive this guy!
18
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,730
What are you talking about?
19
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:44,110
This guy…killed my family…
he killed my little brother!
20
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,680
Wh-What was that…?
21
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,650
Gantetsu killed your family?
22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,050
Yeah.
23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Five years ago.
24
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,360
I’m positive that
this is the guy I saw.
25
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,540
Fire…!
26
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,710
Oh!
27
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
This is horrible…
28
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,050
Is anybody still inside?
29
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,390
Damn!
30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,570
Father! Mother!
31
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,550
Akio.
32
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,850
Akio!
33
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,090
Memory of Flames
34
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,190
Akio…
35
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,980
Todoroki, I found out who
attacked your family.
36
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,590
Really?
37
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,160
A gang of bandits called
the Ninja Dropouts.
38
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Ninja Dropouts?
39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,530
They’re ruthless…
Evil personified…
40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
When they rob the victims
of money and valuables…
41
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,130
They massacre everyone in that house.
42
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,930
Why?
43
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,840
So as not to leave any witnesses behind.
44
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,550
The bodies of your parents
were found but…
45
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,320
The fire spread quickly and
Akio was still small so…
46
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,590
Probably nothing of him remained.
47
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,230
I’m sorry, but you need to
let your little brother go…
48
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
That’s impossible.
49
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,860
I can't do that.
50
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,550
Damn it!
51
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,260
It’s ironic, isn’t it…
52
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,760
When I finally find the killer
of my parents and little brother…
53
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,530
My mission…forces me
to escort him to the capital.
54
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Todoroki.
55
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,140
I’m a full-fledged police officer now.
I’m not a spring chicken!
56
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,510
I didn’t mean to bring
my personal grudges onto the job…
57
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,380
This guy will eventually
be sentenced to death…
58
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,550
That thought has allowed me to endure.
59
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,150
But, right now,
right in front of my eyes…
60
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,560
The same face in the flame…
The face that killed my little brother!
61
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,130
Your…little brother?!
62
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,560
Die, Gantetsu!
63
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,540
–Don’t get in my way!
–Stop!
64
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,480
He’s a thug who’s killed
countless innocent people.
65
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,510
It’s your mission to deliver Gantetsu
to the capital, right?!
66
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,880
It doesn’t matter!
He killed my little brother!
67
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,890
It may be true that Gantetsu is evil, but…
68
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,390
You can’t do that…
69
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,890
There’s nobody watching…
70
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,500
That’s right, here in the middle
of this forest.
71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,960
H-Hey, Todoroki?
72
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,270
Nobody’s watching…
There’s no way they’ll know.
73
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,410
Todoroki… I said, calm down!
I’m telling you, I’m watching!
74
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,480
No, nobody’s watching…
75
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Todoroki!
76
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,550
As long as you keep your mouth shut…
77
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,550
No… Better yet, if you weren’t around…
78
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,850
Wait a second!
79
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,560
What the heck are you thinking?
Calm down!
80
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,820
I'm extremely calm.
81
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,730
You too must…
82
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,200
It can’t be helped…
83
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,570
If things come to this,
I guess I have no choice but to fight!
84
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
What’s the matter?
85
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,640
Why don’t you just come
right out and fight?!
86
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,940
You guys, too! Why don’t you stop hiding?
Come out and show yourselves!
87
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,550
Huh?
88
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,680
Y-You guys are…
89
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,850
Stop bullying Gantetsu!
90
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,550
Give Gantetsu back!
91
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,390
What is this?
92
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,560
I have no idea…
Who the heck are they?
93
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Everybody!
94
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,460
W-Wait a minute…
95
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,730
How are you connected
to Gantetsu…?
96
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Stop that!
97
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,570
Let’s get out of here!
98
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,510
Calm down.
99
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,550
We should be able to
understand each other
100
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
if we just try to talk things over.
101
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,420
You guys aren’t Shinobi, are you?!
102
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,220
It’s dangerous for amateurs
to hold blades!
103
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,420
Lee, what are we gonna do?
104
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,690
This is a problem…
105
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,690
‘Cause if our opponents are amateurs,
we can’t go all out…
106
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,300
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
107
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,950
Damn it! Let go of me!
108
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,250
I need to avenge the deaths
of my family…and my little brother!
109
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,890
Calm down!
110
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,560
Calm down and think about
this whole thing again!
111
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,120
Your…little brother?
112
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,300
Don’t be stupid, Gantetsu…
Don’t come over here right now!
113
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,530
Gantetsu!
114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,320
What's going on?!
115
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,090
Damn it, I can’t move!
116
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
It’s futile.
117
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
That string is stronger than steel.
118
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,500
There’s no way you’ll be able
to cut through it
119
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
with human strength alone.
120
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,000
Who the heck are you?
121
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,070
I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
122
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,010
Ninja Dropout you said?
123
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,840
I, Monju will take Gantetsu.
124
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,350
As long as I have him,
I have no more business with you guys.
125
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,750
Those nets will shrink
as the temperature rises.
126
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,220
So you’ll suffer till the end.
127
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,820
In half an hour or so…
128
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,320
It will cut you into pieces.
129
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,870
Farewell!
130
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,070
Todoroki!
131
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,540
Gantetsu!
132
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,550
Damn it… I’m not about to die
in a place like this.
133
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,530
Our mission is to deliver
Gantetsu to the capital…
134
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,190
Are you an idiot ?
Take a good look at this situation!
135
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,130
We’ll be goners before that happens.
136
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,740
I don’t believe that those Ninja Dropouts
are Gantetsu’s comrades.
137
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,540
Gantetsu was telling the truth.
Those guys might kill Gantetsu.
138
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,150
That’s why I should have killed him
with my own hands!
139
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,550
But remember, that guy was
calling out your name to the very end!
140
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,820
So what’s up with that?!
141
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,650
There must be something
he wanted to tell you!
142
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,760
I don’t want to hear
any excuses from a thug!
143
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,560
I find it hard to believe that
Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
144
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
What was that?!
145
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,970
I’m telling you,
I’m not about to kick the bucket
146
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,400
until I’ve heard what Gantetsu
wanted to say!
147
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,810
Stop it!
148
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,850
Hey, I’m positive we can work
things out if we just talk.
149
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,190
Shut up!
150
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,960
Wait. 					Let’s stop this.
151
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,130
I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout,
because you’re a Ninja.
152
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,900
We’re Shinobi from the Leaf Village.
153
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,570
We were called here to be
part of the police escort
154
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,800
taking Gantetsu to the capital.
155
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,470
Please spare Gantetsu.
156
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,170
That can’t happen.
157
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,540
Gantetsu saved us from
the Ninja Dropouts.
158
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Saved you?
159
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,880
Who in the world are you guys?
160
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,680
We’re all kids whose families
were killed by the Ninja Dropouts.
161
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,960
But Gantetsu secretly rescued us
162
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,390
because he wanted to save
at least the children…
163
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
What was that?!
164
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,100
Gantetsu took care of all of us kids
who had become orphans…
165
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,550
Gantetsu.
166
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,930
Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?
167
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,630
I’m sorry.
168
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,730
Where am I?
169
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,330
So you woke up.
170
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,540
Mother…? Father…?
171
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,540
Where’s Mother?
172
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,550
You poor thing…
But we’re all in the same boat.
173
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,020
You’re not alone…
We’re here for you…
174
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,890
We’re your new family.
175
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,600
I’m leaving the Ninja Dropouts!
176
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,170
I can’t stand this any longer.
177
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,540
I can’t commit robberies with
those guys anymore.
178
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,810
But if you don’t,
they’ll kill you, Gantetsu.
179
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,540
I’ll steal their money.
180
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Huh?
181
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,250
And I’ll get myself captured
by the police.
182
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,550
Come on…
183
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,480
If I do that,
184
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,890
they’ll show up in front of
the prison to try to get me back.
185
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,060
That’s the only way
they can be captured.
186
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
Are you saying you’re gonna
be a decoy…?
187
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,560
It's so that there won’t be
any more victims.
188
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,960
This is my only choice.
189
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,540
Gantetsu really did steal their money
and was captured by the police.
190
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,610
We came to this forest
191
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,110
because we were worried
about Gantetsu’s safety.
192
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,010
We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts
would get caught. However…
193
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,480
So Gantetsu reformed himself
194
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,220
and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?
195
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,860
We have to do something about
the real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!
196
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,130
I don’t really care about
the Ninja Dropouts right now.
197
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,590
What’s important is that
we rescue Gantetsu.
198
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,900
I’m guessing that Gantetsu
is with Naruto.
199
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,770
Don’t worry because he won’t have
been captured by the Ninja Dropouts.
200
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,510
Okay, let’s believe that.
201
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,380
Damn…
202
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,630
If things continue like this,
we’ll turn into dried fish.
203
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,870
Huh?
204
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,610
H-Hey… It loosens up a little
when sweat soaks into it.
205
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,150
What?
206
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Are you serious?
207
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,360
Oh, you’re right.
208
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
Yeah, I know…
209
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
What?!
210
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,610
I’m used to its venom.
lt’s nothing.
211
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,390
I find it hard to believe
that Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
212
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,630
I’m gonna meet up with Gantetsu
one more time
213
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,560
and find out for myself,
no matter what it takes…
214
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,570
That’s right…
I need to see Gantetsu again, too.
215
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,540
I will then avenge the deaths
of my family…and of my little brother.
216
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,520
We did it!
217
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,660
That was a narrow escape!
218
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,230
All right… Let’s hurry up and
rescue Gantetsu!
219
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,800
Yeah… I will find him no matter what
and I'll cut him down!
220
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,410
Huh?
221
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,620
–Gantetsu. 					–Huh?
222
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,890
That’s definitely Gantetsu.
223
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,650
Those guys are…
224
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,530
I-Idiot…
225
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,630
–Gantetsu! 					–Gantetsu!
226
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,670
Gantetsu!
227
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
That’s as far as you’ll go, kid.
228
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,710
That guy is…
229
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,340
Don’t tell me he’s a Ninja Dropout?!
230
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,210
Good answer.
231
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,650
I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
232
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,550
Give Gantetsu back!
233
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,620
I’m not forgiving you for this!
234
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,250
Hey, hey…
235
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,820
Who are these little brats?
236
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,460
Perhaps they’re inexperienced
in the ways of the world, but…
237
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,260
to tell me to give Gantetsu back…
238
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,560
Give us back what we want.
That’s our line, right?
239
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,500
Who the heck are you guys?
240
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,900
You Ninja Dropout jerks…
241
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,840
We are avenging our families’ deaths!
242
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
What?!
243
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,810
You brats just stay quiet.
244
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Damn it!
245
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,420
Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!
246
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,190
It looks like you don’t quite comprehend
the position you’re in right now, huh?!
247
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,230
And moreover, what do they mean
by avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!
248
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,730
Stop!
249
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,240
Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!
250
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,570
It’s my turn!
251
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,750
It doesn’t even budge.
252
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,880
It’s useless… You won’t be able to
tear through this net.
253
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,250
Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.
254
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,990
I refuse.
255
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,560
Huh… I see.
256
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,720
Then how about this?
257
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,730
Akio!
258
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,000
Stop it! I get it.
I’ll talk, so please stop!
259
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
You should have done that
from the start.
260
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,310
These children are the children
from the homes
261
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,540
that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.
262
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,810
I rescued them and gave them shelter.
263
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,920
What? You betrayed us?
264
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,590
I see… You jerk…
265
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,560
You took our treasures and
gave them to these guys.
266
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
They belonged to their families
in the first place.
267
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,200
Don’t mess around with me…
You traitor!
268
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,570
Stop that!
269
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
270
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,700
Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,010
Naruto!
272
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,670
Naruto, you were safe!
273
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,140
Of course I was!
274
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,180
I’m not handing Gantetsu over
to you no matter what!
275
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Gantetsu.
276
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
That’s…
277
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
It can’t be…!
278
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,530
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
279
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,670
Will always be smiling right near by
280
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,540
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
281
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,180
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
282
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,090
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
283
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,920
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
284
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,900
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
285
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,270
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
286
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,600
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
287
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:15,110
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
288
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,980
The wind is probably testing our hearts
289
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,320
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
290
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,460
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
291
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,300
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
292
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,930
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
293
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:44,110
Will always be smiling right near by
294
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,380
Is that the Ninja Dropout’s hideout?
295
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,550
Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.
296
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,760
Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards.
I can never forgive them.
297
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,460
How dare they interfere with
the happy reunion of the siblings!
298
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,590
This is outrageous.
299
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,290
All right, let’s go, Bushy-Brows!
300
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,930
I’m always okay to go.
Even if the enemy is an ex-Shinobi…
301
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,770
We’re going to beat them one and all,
302
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,100
and definitely going to get
Todoroki’s brother back!
303
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,670
Next time: “To Each His Own Path”
//%
1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:14,260
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,950
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,880
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,890
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,630
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,240
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,280
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:17,890
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,300
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,570
Our two hearts
11
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,050
A Past to Be Erased
12
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,520
That mark…
13
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,290
I saw the same one on the guys
that attacked this village!
14
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,890
That’s a lie!
15
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,900
It’s not a lie! This mark…
16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,100
Same from that night…
17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,550
N-No! Spare me!
18
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,890
Stop!
19
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,610
This is the same mark from
that time.
20
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,780
No way!
21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,450
But this wasn’t in
the medical team’s report.
22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,020
Byakugan!
23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,750
It seems this is a particular mark
that only emerges
24
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,160
when he sweats…
25
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,020
You guys get out!
26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,890
Why?
27
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,960
I’m going to take care of him.
28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,130
Say what?! I won’t let you do that!
29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,870
Why do you protect him?
ls the Leaf Village also in cahoots?
30
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,300
No, that’s not it!
31
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,010
He doesn’t remember
a thing from the past…
32
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,940
He has no memory.
33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,010
No memory?
34
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,550
It’s memory loss.
We came in search of his memory.
35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,990
Then you should know now.
He’s a dirty bandit!
36
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,060
Whether or not he has a memory
makes no difference to me!
37
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,390
Calm down!
38
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,700
It would only be in vain
to kill someone
39
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,600
who has no memory of
committing a crime.
40
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,630
Shut up!
41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,870
If you really want to have
your revenge,
42
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,970
do so as much as you like
after getting his memory back…
43
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,970
I won’t stop you at that time.
44
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,210
I won’t let you do that even if
he gets his memory back!
45
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,880
It’s as Neji says.
46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,250
We’ll also find out the identity
of the guys who attacked
47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
if his memory returns
and we get him to talk.
48
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,360
We might be able to save the village
if we can use him to cut a deal…
49
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,900
We have to keep him alive now.
We won’t run away or hide!
50
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,900
Keep quiet… He won’t let Menma live
unless we tell him this.
51
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,870
I’m going to sew up the wound.
Hold his arms and legs.
52
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
That girl is…
53
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,450
I just can’t believe it.
He’s the embodiment of good nature…
54
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,350
To think he’d be a comrade
of the bandits.
55
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,690
I wonder if he became a good guy
after losing his memory.
56
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,290
He just has the same mark as those guys
due to some sort of circumstance.
57
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,260
Even if he lost his memory,
58
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,400
he wouldn’t become this good-natured
of a guy if he was a bad person.
59
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,170
Either way, we’ll know everything
if he get his memory back.
60
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,870
I was…a comrade of the bandits,
wasn’t I?
61
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,540
You heard us talking earlier?
62
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,890
Don’t worry about it.
We don’t know any of the details. Okay?
63
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,520
Heal that wound for now…
64
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,570
I’m going to have
a look around the area.
65
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,000
You understand, right?
66
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,170
Your friends and that guy will die
if you try anything funny.
67
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,170
Do as you like when that happens.
68
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,310
It’s done…
69
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,220
Fuki…
70
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,220
You heard, didn’t you?
71
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,390
I can’t stand it, after all!
72
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,260
Let’s get him. Let’s avenge everyone!
73
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,260
Stop!
74
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,070
It’s still not certain that
Menma’s one of their comrades!
75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,840
You’re just as much to blame
if you protect him!
76
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,900
– Right! 					– Right!
77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
What’s the ruckus?!
78
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,870
Naruto?
79
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,870
Tenten…!
80
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,180
Why did you let him out of the hut?!
81
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,380
Sorry. I dozed off…
82
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,750
I got careless thinking
he couldn’t move…
83
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,920
Guys, stop! He has no memory!
84
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,860
So he doesn’t even know if
he’s one of their comrades or not…!
85
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,890
We warned you before!
86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,060
You guys are just as much to blame
if you protect him any further!
87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,260
Get them!
88
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Stop it!
89
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,170
We should get away for now!
90
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,340
I’m…fine…
91
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,310
What?
92
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,540
Of course, everyone’s angry.
I…should be punished.
93
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
You’ll be killed!
94
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
That’s fine!
95
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,750
What’re you saying, Menma?!
96
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,350
Byakugan!
97
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
It’s them!
98
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,760
The bridge! Raise the bridge!
99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,570
Right!
100
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Got it!
101
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,530
Be careful of the Leaf Ninja and
secure an entrance route!
102
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,390
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
103
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,730
Now’s our chance.
Everyone hide!
104
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,500
You, too!
105
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,440
We can take care of this ourselves!
106
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,740
Come on, Fuki!
107
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
They’ve come from two spots!
108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,390
Where’d they go?!
109
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,990
They vanished.
110
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,020
Be quiet!
111
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,900
The wind…
112
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,070
I get it.
113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
They’ve trapped us
in a Genjutsu
114
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,870
with a different tone mixed in
with the sound of the wind!
115
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,840
Be careful!
We’re now inside their Jutsu!
116
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,880
You noticed too late!
117
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,550
M-My body…
118
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,590
It’s heavy…
119
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,560
This is bad… Is it Paralysis?!
120
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,030
Canceling Sound!
121
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,460
The Paralysis is released.
122
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,800
You backstabber!
123
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,970
Here they come!
124
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,970
I’ll leave those guys to you!
125
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,670
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
126
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,040
It’s futile!
127
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,880
Heh, what’s the matter?
Finished already?!
128
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,850
I don’t even have a scratch on me…
129
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,820
This is what I was after!
130
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,990
Wha--?!
131
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,330
What’s happening?
I’m getting an amazing power.
132
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,760
Here I go!
133
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,260
Rotation!
134
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,100
Now, prepare yourself!
135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,870
You won’t get away!
136
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,960
Here…
137
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,400
This is precious to you, right?
138
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,980
Behind you!
139
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,810
You jerk!
140
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,050
Your voice… It’s back!
141
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,520
Th-Thank you…
142
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,890
Now, let’s go back to the others.
143
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,890
Right.
144
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,800
Menma! You okay?
145
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,960
Yeah…
146
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,500
We took care of most of them!
147
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,840
What about their leader?
What about Shiin?!
148
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,710
I chased after him,
but he got away…
149
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,010
This is bad…
150
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,880
Now that Shiin knows the villagers
won’t abandon their homes and get out,
151
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,480
he’ll use his last resort.
152
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,990
There is a dam built upriver to secure
water resources during a drought.
153
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,030
There is enough water for the village
to last a year, even if it doesn’t rain.
154
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,530
The dam has been rigged to blow up
155
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,700
and to sweep away
the entire village with a flood.
156
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,970
All they care about
is the mine.
157
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,110
We can’t stop something like a flood
158
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,310
unless we move mountains
or something!
159
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,510
Mountains…
160
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,980
That’s it.
We should move mountains!
161
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,850
Naruto! Take me to the mine.
162
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,890
Wha--?
163
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,990
There should be a bunch of
Letter Bombs in the mine!
164
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,930
Letter Bombs?!
What’re you going to do with those?!
165
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,800
I’m going to blow up
the mine itself.
166
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
The crumbled dirt and sand will
fill up the valley
167
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,000
and the flood can be stopped.
168
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Damn it! He’s started!
Let’s hurry, Menma!
169
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,350
Naruto… There’s something
I have to tell you.
170
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,180
Make it later!
171
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,850
I haven’t lost my memory.
172
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,420
Yeah… But stopping
the flood comes first!
173
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,390
No, I’d like you to listen now.
174
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,900
I lost my parents when I was little
and was raised in Shiin’s clan.
175
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,870
They were a small Shinobi clan even
in the Land of Rice Paddies.
176
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,410
But they still had ambitious plans…
177
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,140
However, a Shinobi village was created
in the Land of Rice Paddies
178
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,350
about a year ago.
179
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
It was the Village Hidden in the Sound.
180
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,350
The Village Hidden in the Sound!
181
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,920
Clan members confident in their skill
182
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,860
drifted over to Hidden Sound Village
one after another.
183
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,890
Eventually jobs from
the feudal lord stopped coming.
184
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,300
Shiin the leader of the clan that
had lost its means of livelihood
185
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,300
set his eyes on the mine in this village…
186
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,280
The plan was to just threaten
and chase off the villagers.
187
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,050
But I encountered
unexpected resistance,
188
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,220
and I got scared and tried to escape…
189
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,890
What’re you hesitating for?
Hurry up and take care of him.
190
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,790
Father! Father!
191
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,900
Stop it!
192
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,870
You… You jerk!
193
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,410
Look out!
194
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,880
I’m a member of a clan that
has committed crimes.
195
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,890
It would’ve been better if
I’d just died like that…
196
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,920
How easy things would’ve been
if I could’ve died then…
197
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,300
I got scared thinking about
the villagers who died…
198
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,200
I wanted to forget.
199
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,440
And so I cowardly escaped into
a Jutsu passed down through the clan
200
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,410
that erases memory.
201
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,910
However, the Jutsu didn’t work
very well…
202
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,250
I only temporarily lost my memory
and it came back in a few hours.
203
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,890
Then you had your memory
the whole time?!
204
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,360
I’m sorry…
205
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,530
Knock it off!
206
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,700
Then why didn’t you tell me about
that honestly from the start?!
207
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,900
If you had, it would’ve been…
208
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,470
I didn’t have the courage to make
the crimes of the clan public.
209
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,580
But I thought the clan must
not commit any further crimes.
210
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,880
So I pretended to lose
my memory.
211
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,720
And to prevent the clan from
adding to their crimes…
212
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,260
I wanted to bring some of you
Leaf Shinobi here
213
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,030
and have you help out.
214
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,830
I knew of Shiin’s next plan.
215
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,930
There must not be any
more village casualties.
216
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,600
Stopping that is my duty
for having survived.
217
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,170
Duty…?
218
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,510
I needed the help
of the Leaf Shinobi
219
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,150
before Shiin could
execute his next plan…
220
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,350
I wanted to round them all up
during the attack earlier.
221
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,160
But since things have come this far,
I’ll stop the flood.
222
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,890
Thanks, Naruto…
223
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,240
I leave Shiin to you.
Find and stop him, no matter what.
224
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,940
You… This…?
225
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,840
This is goodbye.
226
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,510
Somebody has to blow up
the Letter Bombs inside…
227
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,180
If you do that, you’ll…!
228
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,880
Thanks to you, my life has
taken on more meaning…
229
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,890
What’s that sound?
230
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,900
There are intermittent explosions
occurring upriver…
231
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,500
The village will be engulfed in
a mudslide if the dam breaks!
232
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,400
No…!
233
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,870
Neji…
234
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,250
It’s coming!
235
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,140
Goodbye…
236
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,640
Naruto…
237
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,880
Menma!
238
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,220
Wh-What happened…?
239
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,290
It seems the crumbled mountain
stopped the mudslide…
240
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,030
Then, that means the village is saved?
241
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,260
Yeah…
242
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,300
– Thank goodness!
– That’s a relief…
243
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,880
H-How can that be?!
244
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,550
Menma!!
245
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,230
That jerk…!
246
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,600
He won’t get away!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
247
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,930
Hold it!
248
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,070
Interfering with our plan!
249
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,140
You think such a Jutsu will work
on me… Huh?!
250
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,520
Die!
251
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,050
I’ll stop you in Menma’s place!
252
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,190
What?!
253
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,060
Rasengan!
254
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,140
He sacrificed his life to save
the village, huh…?
255
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,580
No matter what his past was,
he was a good guy at heart…
256
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,080
Mister…
257
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,720
I wanted to say a word of apology.
258
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,220
Not being able to remember
anything until the end
259
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,060
might have been salvation for him…
260
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,680
It was a promise, right?
To eat this with you.
261
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,580
You don’t need
to say anything to him?
262
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,320
He’ll be fine if he has an appetite.
I know how he is.
263
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,350
He’ll overcome it on his own
as time passes.
264
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,090
For a while he’ll probably remember
each time he eats ramen…
265
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,890
That’s fine.
266
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,900
People can get stronger
precisely because
267
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,530
they have feelings
that are never forgotten…
268
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,600
That’s what’s called growth.
269
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,180
Damn… This is good!
270
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,880
Menma…
271
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,890
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
272
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,200
Will always be smiling right near by
273
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,940
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
274
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,680
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
275
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,590
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
276
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,420
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
277
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,400
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
278
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,770
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
279
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,100
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
280
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,580
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
281
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,480
The wind is probably testing our hearts
282
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,790
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
283
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,890
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
284
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,800
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
285
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,440
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
286
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,610
Will always be smiling right near by
287
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,450
The Village Hidden in the Sand
requested an auxiliary force?
288
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,720
Ones who call themselves
the Four Celestials
289
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,820
took one of Sand Village’s Ninja
candidates as a hostage
290
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,790
and escaped towards
the Land of Fire.
291
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,960
Presently, Gaara and others
are chasing them.
292
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,930
That means an ambush, doesn’t it?
293
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,530
I will leave the strategy up to you.
294
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,330
Take some Genin you can use
and leave within half an hour.
295
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
– That’s all.
– Hold on please.
296
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,470
What is it?
297
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,870
Let me borrow Sakura.
298
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,770
Next time: “The Targeted Shukaku”
//%
1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,080
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,990
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,000
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,540
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,990
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,700
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,080
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,750
have also been lost.
9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,290
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,330
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,950
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,200
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,410
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:20,160
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,370
Multiple Traps!
Countdown to Destruction
16
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,000
This many Paper Bombs…
is a diversion?
17
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,580
Y-Yes!
18
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,990
No way…
19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,120
No. He’s a man who
would go that far…
20
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,830
After all, he is Genno
the Trapper!
21
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,040
Remember. Think.
His actions thus far…
22
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,000
His intent hidden in there.
23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,580
First he steals the blueprints
for key facilities in the village
24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,830
and pretends to blow himself up
in front of the Anbu Black Ops.
25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,990
Because of the incident,
26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,500
an S-Level Emergency
Security Alert is given…
27
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,620
The village becomes poorly manned…
28
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,540
and Genno is able to
move around as he pleases…
29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,990
Then why did he scatter
the blueprints he stole?
30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,790
With this incident, it becomes evident
that Genno might still be alive
31
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,250
so the guys on watch outside
end up returning
32
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,950
to the village as quickly possible…
33
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,450
Could that have been his objective?
34
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,080
He directed everyone’s attention
to the Paper Bombs
35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,040
and reassembled
the village Shinobi.
36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,990
If his aim is to
set up something there…
37
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,990
Could it be…?
38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,580
The Paper Bombs in the village
were a decoy?
39
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,580
You can’t see the Paper Bombs
in this room?
40
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,790
What’s this?!
41
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,870
What’s up with these Paper Bombs?
42
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,370
Do you know the geological conditions
43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,370
of the Great Stone Faces?
44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,370
G-Geological conditions…?
45
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,620
To be precise, the geological condition
of this plateau
46
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,540
which the Great Stone Faces
are carved into.
47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,120
The plateau towering behind
the Village Hidden in the Leaves
48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,500
is made of extremely hard rock.
49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,990
But this rock has narrow lines
running through it, you see…
50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,580
It can be easily broken if power
is applied along those lines.
51
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,450
The Great Stone Faces
were created using this…
52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,580
This time and thirty years ago
53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,290
aren’t the only times I’ve come
to the Leaf…
54
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,990
I’ve visited the Leaf several times
and checked things out…
55
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,990
And then I finally determined it…
56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,990
I determined how to set Paper Bombs
to destroy this plateau!
57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wha--?!
58
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,450
I’m fairly certain
no one would imagine
59
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,250
the destruction of
the Great Stone Faces…
60
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,990
Especially when
61
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,950
we’re in the middle of Paper Bomb
removal operations.
62
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,200
We wouldn't even think
about the Great Stone Faces…
63
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,830
But if that entire plateau were
to slide down and crumble…
64
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,580
The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
65
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,990
would be completely buried
in earth and sand!
66
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,160
The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
67
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,990
It would be destroyed!
68
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,830
Choji, contact the Fifth Hokage
immediately!
69
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,450
Make sure the guys who return
don’t enter the village…
70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,990
Shikamaru, be happy!
71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,160
Guy Sensei and the others
have come back!
72
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,990
Hurry, hurry!
Now that Might Guy has returned,
73
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,410
we won’t let the enemy do
as he pleases!
74
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,330
Too late, huh…?
75
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
What’s the matter…?
76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Shikamaru!
77
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
Naruto has…!
78
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,660
Why…? Why destroy
the whole village…?
79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,750
If you do that,
many innocent people will die.
80
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,620
And all the buildings you built
will be destroyed.
81
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,990
Is that what you want?!
82
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,990
You may think revenge is
your last job or whatever,
83
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,250
but something like
this is absolutely mistaken.
84
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,040
If you’re going to go through
with this no matter what…
85
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,290
I’ll stop you!
86
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,580
That’s impossible.
87
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,700
No way will I let you detonate
the Paper Bombs!
88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,790
Nope. I won from the moment
you set foot in here.
89
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,330
Even if you defeat me,
90
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,080
the triggering device will activate
the instant you leave this place.
91
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,990
It seems everyone has returned…
92
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,750
I guess I’ll be activating
the triggring device…
93
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,990
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
shall meet
94
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,750
the same fate as Heat Devil Village!
95
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,990
I won’t let that happen!
96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
97
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,950
It’s over!
98
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,540
It’s useless to resist…
99
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,330
It’s impossible for you alone
to disarm all of my traps.
100
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,990
No doubt, it might be impossible
for me alone…
101
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,540
but I’ve got friends!
102
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,370
But didn’t you do nothing
but badmouth them at Ichiraku?
103
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,330
Yeah. I get in fights with them a lot
and they tick me off sometimes…
104
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,580
But they’re my friends!
105
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,990
They’re Shinobi
who will protect the Leaf with me!
106
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,540
No matter what traps you set…
107
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,990
they’ll manage somehow,
no matter what!
108
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,830
Then, I’ll finish everything before that.
109
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,750
You won't be able to stop them this time!
110
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,250
Fang Over Fang…!
111
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,500
I’d say that was a close shave, huh?
112
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,870
Kiba! Akamaru!
How’d you know I was here…?
113
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,200
Thank Hinata!
114
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,200
She thought it was strange that
you’d leave for no reason,
115
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,500
so she frantically searched
for you with her Byakugan.
116
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,580
But the Byakugan shouldn’t
be that versatile…
117
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,990
I'm surprised you found us…
118
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,330
Well, we had a pretty good idea
of where you were…
119
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Shikamaru said that the final trap
would be in the Great Stone Faces.
120
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Shikamaru did…?
121
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,330
I see…
122
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,750
This means I shouldn’t take
young opponents lightly, huh…?
123
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,250
Right. You misjudged our power…
124
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,790
Th-These are…insects?!
125
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,620
That’s right…
You’re finished now.
126
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,990
Get down, you two!
127
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Old man…
128
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,950
He blew himself up!
129
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,990
No, that’s not it!
130
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
It’s a Substitution…
131
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,700
It seems he switched just before
being covered with the insects…
132
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,990
It’s over now…
133
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Wh-What’s this…?
134
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,450
It’s the Shadow Strangle Jutsu…
135
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,410
You anticipated my actions…?
136
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,040
Yup. Checkmate, old man.
Come on right over here…
137
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,830
Choji, restrain him.
138
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Got it…
139
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,950
Oh, shoot! His shadow…!
140
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,990
Shikamaru… What did he do…?
141
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,160
He had set it so a smoke screen
would activate
142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
if he were touched by an enemy.
143
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,990
Choji, to the right!
144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,950
Human Boulder!
145
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,990
The Leaf is now finished!
146
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,500
A strike?
147
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,370
Why won't…
the Paper Bomb explode?
148
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,000
Tough luck…
149
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,120
We already disarmed that Paper Bomb.
150
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,580
And we disarmed all
the triggering devices
151
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,830
set inside the Great Stone Faces.
152
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,990
This is as far as you go old man…
153
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,830
That’s right…
Prepare yourself!
154
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,370
It’s useless to run!
155
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,160
I don’t know how incredible of
a Trapper you are.
156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,990
But my friends’ teamwork
is better than you are!
157
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,990
I must not give up here…
158
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,990
Give up, already!
159
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,410
No matter what you set up,
we’ll stop it!
160
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,200
I wouldn’t be able…
to show my face to my son…
161
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Where’d he…?
162
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Over there!
163
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,700
It seems you haven’t disarmed
all of the triggering devices…
164
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,990
I…win!
165
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,870
The village!
166
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,620
Don’t be fooled, guys!
This is a Genjutsu!
167
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,990
Release!
168
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,790
Naruto!
169
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,200
Huh? Wh-What?
170
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,200
Summoning Jutsu!
171
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,790
He's planning to get on that bird
and escape!
172
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,990
Leave it to me!
173
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,990
Mind Transfer Jutsu!
174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,790
All right! It’s a success…
175
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,870
– Ino…! 					– Hey!
176
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,290
Why’d you break the Jutsu?!
177
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,870
What’s the matter?
178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,790
His body… It really hurt…
179
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,990
He’s fighting while enduring
a lot of pain in his body!
180
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,990
I won’t let you escape!
181
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Naruto…
182
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,830
Sure enough…
183
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,330
I’m no match for a young person
at Taijutsu, huh…?
184
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,290
It’s not like that…
185
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,000
You’re a quite the practitioner
of Taijutsu…
186
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,990
Now it’s finally over!
187
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,750
It’s not over yet…
188
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
What?
189
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,040
What do you mean…
it’s not over yet?
190
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,450
Where’s the bird he summoned earlier?
191
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
Oh! Over there!
192
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,540
There are Paper Bombs on its feet!
193
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,950
What?!
194
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,080
The Mountainside Image of
the Third Hokage is the spot
195
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,000
where I restored a crack…
196
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,290
I used a device different
from the others…
197
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,540
That cracked section is slightly
more fragile than the other areas…
198
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,990
I set an triggering device
that takes advantage of that…
199
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,580
If there an explosion occurs there,
200
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,000
the other Paper Bombs
will explode at once.
201
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,830
Going so far as to set a device
in such a place…
202
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,250
To think we overlooked that…!
203
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,990
That means he summoned
that bird to activate the device?!
204
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,250
At last…my wish will come true…
205
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,830
Here it comes!
206
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,990
I'll use this…
207
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
It dodged them!
208
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,080
We can’t bring it down with
a long-range attack?!
209
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,990
I’ll defend the Leaf,
no matter what!
210
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,620
I’ll blow him away with the Rasengan
before he slams into this place!
211
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,620
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
212
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
What?!
213
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
What?!
214
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,990
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
Both arms!
215
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,450
Naruto, use my hands!
216
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,540
Thanks, Choji!
217
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,990
H-Hinata?!
218
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,080
U-Umm…Shikamaru told me to read
that bird’s movements
219
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,830
with my Byakugan
and to give you directions…
220
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Huh…?
221
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,750
I leave the rest to you!
222
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,990
All right, let’s go, Hinata!
223
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,000
R-Right!
224
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Byakugan!
225
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,870
Not yet… Draw it closer…
226
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,990
It’ll be okay.
227
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,990
No matter what,
228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,990
I’ll protect the village the Third Hokage
risked his life to protect!
229
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,700
Naruto… Now!
230
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Rasengan!
231
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
It vanished?!
232
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,910
Up above!
233
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,370
Damn it. Reach!
234
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,990
You little!
235
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,000
What? Did something happen…?
236
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,620
All right!
237
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,910
Yes! We did it, Hinata!
238
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,990
N-Naruto…
239
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,200
The inside of his body
is in terrible shape…
240
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,790
It’s amazing that he lived until today.
241
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,330
Old man…
242
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,540
It’s too bad…
I failed to leave my name in history…
243
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,990
But…I had…fun…
244
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,750
What?
245
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,830
What do you mean, old man?!
246
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,990
What do you mean you had fun?!
247
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,000
Old Man Genno!
248
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,160
Naruto? 					No, it’s not…
249
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,450
“My son proud as a peacock having
beaten me at treasure hunting…”
250
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Treasure hunting…?
251
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Did you notice…?
252
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,990
Huh?
253
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,040
The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualty
in this incident…
254
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,540
Old Man Genno!
Open your eyes!
255
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,990
Old Man Genno!!
256
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,080
I figured it out, Shikamaru…
257
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,580
It seems the person in this picture
is Genno’s real son…
258
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,200
Son…?
259
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,370
It seems he became
a Shinobi like his father…
260
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,250
but lost his life right after that
when the Leaf invaded Heat Devil Village.
261
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,990
I bet he wanted to avenge his own son…
262
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,410
So he did something like this…
263
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,120
No doubt, at first he may have
infiltrated the village for revenge…
264
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,950
At first…?
265
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,790
Something was kind of bugging me,
266
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,080
so I checked out the triggering device
that was set in the Academy
267
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,790
one more time.
268
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,830
There was a loose connection
in one spot.
269
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,660
It was set up so it wouldn’t activate
even if the target were hit…
270
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,660
Wasn’t that just Genno’s mistake…?
271
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,450
Genno was a first-rate Trapper.
272
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,870
It’s unlikely he’d make such
a simple mistake…
273
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,290
No doubt about it…
274
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,080
The same goes for the traps in
the Great Stone Faces…
275
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,450
There were some defective bombs
mixed in with the Paper Bombs.
276
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,830
Even if the traps were activated,
277
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,000
there's a strong possibility that
278
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,990
they'd only make a few cracks
in the Great Stone Faces.
279
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,700
Then he had no serious intention
of smashing the Leaf?
280
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,990
Then…for what purpose…?
281
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
Treasure hunting…
282
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,830
What do you mean treasure hunting?
283
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,330
It makes more sense
to think of it like that.
284
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,990
In other words, he infiltrated
the village for the sake of revenge,
285
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,500
but he changed his mind
after meeting Naruto
286
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,990
who was a spitting image
of his son…
287
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,160
He probably knew that
he didn’t have long to live.
288
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,700
If he was going to do something
before dying,
289
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,290
he wanted it to be
the thing he found most fun…
290
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,990
He probably wanted to re-enact
his treasure-hunts with his son…
291
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,500
using the traps he set to smash the Leaf.
292
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
So that’s what it was.
293
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,580
Well, it’s just conjecture, though.
294
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,200
So that old man…
wasn’t a bad person…
295
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,040
I told you from the start.
296
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,330
Those who like Ichiraku's ramen
can't be bad people!
297
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,660
What? But in actuality,
didn’t he hate ramen?
298
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,990
Ichiraku ramen is different!
299
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,660
There’s no way you can keep
eating something you hate every day.
300
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,990
Exactly!
301
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Old man…
302
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,450
Naruto…?
303
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,620
The enemies who come to the Leaf
won’t always be like this.
304
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,120
Someone like Orochimaru
might attack again!
305
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,040
That means we must
always be prepared!
306
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,990
Right!
307
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,000
It’s a pain, though…
308
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,370
I’ll eat in preparation for that!
309
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,370
We’ll protect the Leaf Village!
310
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,990
With all of us working together…
311
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,450
On a checkerboard night
312
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,990
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
313
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,450
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
314
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,620
Suggestively
315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,370
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
316
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,990
The Trombone gradually going off-key
317
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,660
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
318
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,700
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
319
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,910
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,950
Thank you all for your support!
321
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,700
We're going to fill the airwaves
with our appreciation…
322
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,040
We've even called on someone
who hasn't been in the show recently
323
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,410
to make a guest appearance!
324
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,250
We're going to look back at
all the Ninja best battles!!
325
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,870
What? I'm not sure I understand,
but that sounds amazing!
326
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,410
Look forward to it! Cha!
327
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,950
By the way, who's our guest?
328
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,990
– It's a secret!
– You're not even going to tell me?!
329
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,620
Next Time: "The Top 5 Ninja Battles!"
330
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,990
There are also fun extras!
331
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,700
Tune in!
//%
1
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,520
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,270
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,890
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,560
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,060
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:45,940
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:55,400
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:06,190
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:15,770
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,890
What were you gazing at?
11
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,980
Is this really Moso’s house?
12
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,560
Here he’s a superintendant officer,
13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,890
so I thought it’d be a more luxurious
building with gold folding screens.
14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,350
Your voices are too loud.
15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,060
Lord Moso is a magnificent person
with no self-interests.
16
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,350
So he lives frugally.
17
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,730
But you know, he’s an old man
18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,980
who’s the second most important guy
in the land next to the feudal lord, right?
19
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,020
He smacks of being really poor.
20
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,890
Naruto!
21
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,400
Well well, how shameful of me
to present such a poor residence.
22
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,190
Lord Moso.
23
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,890
What?!
24
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,980
This old man like from
some dumpling shop?
25
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,480
I’m an old man from
a dumpling shop?
26
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,730
Geez, unbelievable!
27
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,400
Idiot!
28
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,940
What’re you doing, Neji?!
29
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,890
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
30
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,890
So you are Ninja who came from
the Village Hidden in Leaves?
31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,890
From the right,
this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.
32
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,520
I hear you encountered
the Cursed Warrior that appeared
33
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,060
in Lord Komei’s residence last night.
34
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,650
Yes.
35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,230
So, how did it go?
36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,100
Did you figure out the true identity
of the Cursed Warrior?
37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,150
Yeah, it’s a real ghost.
38
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,440
Oh, a ghost, huh?
39
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,020
Don’t be jumping to conclusions
on your own.
40
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,480
But he appears all of a sudden
and flies around.
41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah, and on top of that,
the inside of his armor was empty.
42
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,400
No matter how bizarre the thing,
there’s always a trick.
43
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,900
I’ll pin down the true identity without fail.
44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,690
That is encouraging…
45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,020
We have just changed feudal lords
and the public is still anxious.
46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,900
Please eliminate the rumors of
the Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.
47
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,150
I beg of you.
48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,890
Please!
49
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,520
Tsurucho Yakitori
50
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,310
Here are your chicken wings.
51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,020
Oh, here we go!
52
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,400
They look tasty!
53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,270
Hot!
54
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,230
That Moso superintendant officer
seems like a good guy.
55
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,890
Yes. It was also Lord Moso
who came to my rescue
56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,020
and selected me to be a page.
57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,850
The son of the feudal lord succeeds him
58
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,850
and an excellent superintendant officer
offers him tutelage…
59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,890
The government appears
to be stable, but…
60
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,980
Then why is there a strange rumor
going around
61
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,190
about the haunting
of the previous feudal lord?
62
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,650
There’s probably somebody displeased
63
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,730
with this dramatic replacement
of the feudal lord.
64
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,310
Do you have any idea who it might be?
65
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,980
Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.
66
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,850
Isn't that the name of
the tactician you were talking about
67
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,560
who wanted to become the feudal lord?
68
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,850
Then why did the Cursed Warrior
appear in his residence?
69
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,890
Perhaps to deflect attention.
70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,230
That’s it. 					I bet that’s it.
71
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,270
All right, since it’s come to this,
72
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,890
if we can nab that old man
called Komei or whatever
73
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,810
and quickly get him to own up…
74
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,890
Guys, let’s get fired up and
get going!
75
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,100
Idiot. We can’t do something
like that without proof.
76
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,810
He is a tactician of this land
more or less, so.
77
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,060
Oh man, that’s no fun.
78
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,730
First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,
the feudal lord.
79
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,850
That’s not possible. Lord Sagi
does not like to meet anybody.
80
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,890
Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.
Let us meet him, okay?
81
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,600
You’re a “nipple” friend, right?
82
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,060
If you’re going to say that,
say, “childhood friend.”
83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,890
Huh?
84
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,890
Can we really meet him
in a place like this?
85
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,440
This lake holds fond memories
for Lord Sagi.
86
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,890
And…for me as well.
87
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,890
In our young days,
88
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,060
Lord Sagi always played with
his little sister Lady Toki here.
89
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,980
He might come here around about today
with his attendants…
90
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,890
If we’re lucky.
91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,270
It’s up to luck, huh?
92
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,520
It’s Lord Sagi.
93
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,890
Lord Sagi, we have arrived.
94
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,600
Thank you.
95
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,980
Oh wow…
So that’s Lord Sagi, huh?
96
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,350
He’s cute. He is kind of my liking…
97
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,650
My watch has remained stopped
since that time.
98
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
Hey, what’s he doing?
99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,770
He’s probably reminiscing.
100
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,350
The only thing that can comfort
Lord Sagi’s heart
101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,100
is his memories with Lady Toki.
102
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:33,980
Byakugan.
103
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Where is it?
104
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,770
Where’s this bloodthirsty aura
coming from?
105
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,230
It’s not above ground?
106
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,430
Could it be, underwater…?
107
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,310
Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!
108
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,730
I don’t think so!
109
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,850
Who the heck are you guys?
110
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,560
Damn it!
I won’t let you get away.
111
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,120
Wait, Naruto!
112
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,410
What is it?
113
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,580
A letter bomb in the water.
114
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,370
That was a close one.
115
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,660
If you’d chased after them as is,
you would’ve been totally entangled.
116
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,200
Settle down.
117
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,990
Lord Sagi!
118
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,660
Are you all right?!
119
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,910
Yes, I’m fine.
120
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,200
Thank goodness!
121
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,290
Lord Sagi, these three are Ninja
from the Village Hidden in Leaves…
122
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,370
They came to investigate
the true identity of the Cursed Warrior.
123
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,750
That was unnecessary.
I bet it was that  Moso’s idea?
124
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,990
It was all because
he was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.
125
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,990
The fact is, if these people
were not here now…
126
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Silence.
127
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,660
Y-Yes, my lord.
128
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,620
Hey-hey, do you really not get
how this guy feels?!
129
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,990
Chishima was seriously
worried about you.
130
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,330
Without his passionate friendship,
131
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,790
the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn’t have
taken action with that low commission fee.
132
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,790
I am not obliged.
133
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,040
How bothersome!
134
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,660
Say what?!
135
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,330
Friendship is in the past.
136
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,330
I became a feudal lord and
he is a mere page.
137
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,990
We are now standing on
different surfaces.
138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,080
Say that again! I’ll slug the guy
who tramples on friendship--!
139
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,500
Let it go, Naruto.
140
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,870
What’re you doing?! Let go of me!
141
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,500
I have to give guys like this
a good thumping!
142
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,330
You are talking about a feudal lord!
143
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,830
It would have been better
had it pierced my throat.
144
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,830
Go.
145
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,500
Yes, my lord.
146
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,080
Jeez, who does he think he is?!
147
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,330
Jeez, a feudal lord.
148
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,660
Please forgive him.
149
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,540
What? You don’t have a problem
with being told off like that?!
150
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,950
He wasn’t like that in the old days.
151
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,330
His father and little sister
died in succession
152
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,910
and he became cold-hearted.
153
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,990
So that’s what it was.
154
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,080
I’m sure the day will come
155
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,580
when he will turn back into
the kind-hearted Lord Sagi.
156
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,910
I don’t know about that.
157
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,080
The Shuriken from before.
158
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,990
This is an odd shape.
159
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,910
Hm? Let me have a look.
160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,910
Oh!
161
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,620
Does it look familiar to you
or something?
162
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,830
Y-Yes. There are no Ninja
in the Land of Birds.
163
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,580
But there are guardsmen
receiving special training.
164
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Is it a weapon those people use?
165
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,200
Yes.
166
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,370
Who commands those guardsmen?
167
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,330
The person who organizes them
is Lord Komei the tactician.
168
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,990
Say what?!
169
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,370
Komei again.
170
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Komei must have originally thought to
mislead the public with the Cursed Warrior
171
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,660
and attempted to create
a rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.
172
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,990
But the relationship between
the two is tight.
173
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,870
And by Moso summoning us here,
he probably sensed that the day
174
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,700
was approaching when the truth
behind the incident would be revealed
175
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,410
and he plotted
to assassinate Lord Sagi.
176
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,620
If we’ve figured out that much,
let’s charge on in--!
177
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,080
Hold your horses, Naruto.
178
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,750
We have to find more hard evidence.
179
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Hey, is that how it is?
180
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,870
Yeah, that’s how it is.
181
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,200
Neji, look at that.
182
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,990
No doubt, it’s Komei!
183
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,500
To think he’d go out without attendants
184
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,750
even though the Cursed Warrior
might appear.
185
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,450
All right, let’s follow him.
186
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,790
This is the temple where
the Cursed Warrior appeared last night.
187
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,160
Something smells fishy.
188
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,040
He’s shown up…!
189
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,700
Byakugan.
190
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,990
What’s this?!
191
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
There’s no need to waver anymore!
192
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Hey! Wait.
193
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,910
I’ve witnessed the true identity
of the ghost!
194
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,990
Who’s there?
195
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,580
Hey hey, Komei!
196
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,660
You’re the one responsible
for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
197
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,410
What?
198
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,830
H-Hold it!
199
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,450
Naruto, get down!
200
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,580
I did it!
201
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,580
Damn it! No good.
202
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,750
This thing’s not just a ghost, after all.
203
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,250
A tornado?
204
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,990
I can’t see the Cursed Warrior!
205
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,870
Byakugan.
206
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,990
A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!
207
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,290
8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!
208
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,620
What’re you letting your mind drift for?!
209
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,580
Sorry… I never thought a ghost could
use Ninjutsu.
210
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,580
It’s not a ghost inside the armor.
lt’s a Shinobi.
211
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,910
And quite a wily one at that.
212
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,790
This is the same shape
as the shuriken from this afternoon.
213
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,540
He’s an important witness.
Take him alive.
214
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,200
Leave it to me!
215
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,330
But we can’t take him alive
216
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,990
if we don’t do something about
that tornado.
217
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,540
Naruto.
218
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,410
I’m counting on you!
219
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,870
Right. I’ll try!
220
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,200
Tenten, use as many weapons
as possible and draw his attention.
221
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,950
Roger.
222
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,000
No good. No effect at all.
223
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,830
That’s fine. Just keep at it.
224
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,600
Neji…now!
225
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,090
Gentle Fist Technique,
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
226
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,090
8 Trigrams 2 Palms.
227
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,760
4 Palms.
228
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,510
8 Palms.
229
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,930
16 Palms.
230
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,220
32 Palms.
231
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,760
64 Palms.
232
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,760
All right, we did it!
233
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,090
We’ll find out the true identity
for sure this time.
234
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,090
Show us your real face.
235
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,350
What’s this?
236
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,090
It’s empty again.
237
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,350
This can’t be!
238
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,600
Lord Komei, we have seized from
a storeroom in your residence,
239
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,510
one suit of white armor along
with guardsmen Shuriken.
240
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,470
We would like you to report
to the magistrate’s office
241
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,090
as a material witness in
the recent Cursed Warrior incident
242
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,140
as well as the attempted assassination
of Lord Sagi.
243
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,010
I have no choice.
244
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,430
Thank you very much.
245
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,680
With this, Lord Sagi’s heart should
settle down somewhat.
246
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,350
Case closed.
247
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,430
Still, they were sure prepared.
248
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,260
Here an hour has barely passed
since contacting Moso.
249
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:50,930
At that time…
250
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,760
– Huh? 					– Huh?
251
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,680
There was a human presence
in tonight’s Cursed Warrior.
252
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,850
The presence of someone alive.
253
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,090
A presence?
254
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
But you said you didn’t feel such
a presence in the first Cursed Warrior.
255
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,140
Yeah.
256
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,800
Hey, what does that mean?
257
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,220
In other words, the two Cursed Warrior
are separate beings.
258
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:41,140
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
259
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:52,850
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
260
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:04,090
What dreams did you chase to get here?
261
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:16,260
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
262
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:27,800
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
263
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:39,220
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
264
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:45,090
I’ll be close to you
265
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,260
How can we go back to the village
when there's all this mystery?
266
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,090
If we're gonna investigate,
this has to be it.
267
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,800
What? Could this black thing be…?
268
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:08,090
I get it! We use this
to get through the dark…
269
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,350
Hey, why did we end up
in a place like this?!
270
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,390
Next: “Too Late for Help”
//%
1
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,020
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,770
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,560
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,890
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,900
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,350
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,810
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,310
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,770
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,770
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,980
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,650
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,480
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,100
All the kids said
15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,560
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,400
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,730
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,150
into this windless night
19
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,690
Because they want to change something
20	01:01:41:29	01:01:46:07
Deep Cover?!
A Super S-Rank Mission
20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,060
It could be that way…
21
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,310
Sure enough, Ichiraku ramen is
the best for getting energized!
22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,980
One more, Pops!
23
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,980
Coming right up!
24
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,520
Huh?
25
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,890
One more, you said, eh…?
26
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,600
Just when I thought you’d snuck out of
your hospital room
27
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,400
and were doing some training…
28
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,440
You guys want some, too?
29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,440
Pop, here's the tab.
30
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,350
Thanks for your business!
31
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,890
Jeez, I’m fine!
32
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,270
Naruto, even if it looks like you’ve healed
on the surface, you’re still battered.
33
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,230
It’s not like that!
I have to train and get stronger!
34
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,400
Yeah-yeah,
after you’ve healed completely.
35
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,060
Damn it! I have to keep my promise
to Sakura without further delay…!
36
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,400
Sakura… You’re so pathetic.
37
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,890
Naruto…This is a…
once in a lifetime request...
38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,440
Please bring…
please bring Sasuke back.
39
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,890
I couldn’t do it!
I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!
40
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,270
At this point, the only person who
would be able to stop Sasuke…
41
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,890
who would be able to save him…
42
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,890
Is you…Naruto…
43
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,230
All I did…was cry…
All I did was totally rely on Naruto.
44
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,890
I didn’t do anything myself.
45
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke
even if it meant his life…
46
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,100
What can I do for Sasuke now…?
47
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,100
I just have to put my life on the line
and do it!
48
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,890
It’s futile. The ropes are made
of a maiden’s black hair.
49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,020
And the knot is a Shinobi
reverse butterfly knot.
50
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,560
It won’t be easily untied.
51
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,980
Give me a break.
52
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,890
I have to start training as soon as possible
and get stronger.
53
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,890
Then do as the Medical Corps says
and rest quietly.
54
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,940
Come in.
55
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,890
Oh…
56
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,520
Sorry, Sakura…
57
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,850
I’d like to get moving immediately
if possible, but…
58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,690
He has astonishing recuperative power,
but overdoing it is a big no-no.
59
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,890
I’m okay!
60
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,020
Be a little more patient!
61
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,980
Just wait a little longer!
I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!
62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,890
No…
63
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,230
It’s okay…
64
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,900
Up until now,
I was totally reliant on you…
65
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,520
and I did nothing, so…
66
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,480
What’s the matter, Sakura…?
67
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,890
Did something happen?!
68
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,270
No… I'm was relieved
to see you doing well.
69
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,270
This time, I’ll do my best.
70
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Sakura…?
71
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,230
I heard you snuck out of the hospital.
72
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,940
Do you want to train that badly?
73
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,850
Pervy Sage…? My…apple!
74
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,440
Well well, things look
like they’re going smoothly.
75
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,480
Don't you worry.
I’ll train you hard right away.
76
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,850
Umm…about the training.
77
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,350
I was wondering if you could
wait a little while longer.
78
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,350
Hmm?
79
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,890
I’m not saying I don’t want to train.
80
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,310
But I remembered some
odds and ends I need to take care of.
81
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,890
Oh?
82
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,020
Odds and ends, huh?
83
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,440
Come on. Please?
84
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,190
Come in!
85
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,940
Oh, I’ve been spotted, huh?
86
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,480
I’m guessing, you want to peep?
87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,060
No matter how long you wait,
I won’t show anything.
88
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,890
Wh-Who’d peep at an old lady?!
89
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,270
N-No, I take that back!
90
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,560
Actually, I’ve come to make
an earnest request to you as the Hokage.
91
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,230
Talk.
92
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,400
This time, I’ll do my best.
93
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,810
It couldn’t be that Sakura’s going to…
94
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,900
This might be…my last look…
95
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,600
Sakura…
96
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
How did you…?
97
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,770
I know what you’re thinking!
98
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,270
That there’d be nothing
I could do even if I were to go…!
99
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,650
But I hate myself just standing here
doing nothing!
100
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,060
Always being a hindrance to
and taking advantage of everyone…
101
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,690
Not being able to do
one single thing respectably…
102
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,890
It’s useless to stop me!
103
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,400
I won’t stop you…
104
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,890
You should do it until you’re satisfied.
105
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,890
But…I’m going, too.
106
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,440
But…
107
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,900
It’s become just the two of us…
108
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,890
But we’re a three-man squad, right?
109
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,890
Yeah.
110
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,600
You guys…
111
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,770
Oops! Pervy Sage?
112
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,890
This person…is Jiraiya,
one of the legendary Sannin?
113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,850
If you, without permission,
114
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,650
go out past the border of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves...
115
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,560
you know at least that you’ll be sent
to prison as Rogue Ninja, right?
116
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,650
It’s no use stopping us!
117
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,890
I won’t stop you.
118
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,810
You’ve been given a mission
by Lady Hokage.
119
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,310
You’re to investigate and report
on the Land of Rice Paddies
120
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,900
where the Village Hidden in Sound is
and where Sasuke has been taken away.
121
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,060
The mission is set to be carried out
in a group of three.
122
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,980
As of now, you will work under me.
You got a problem?!
123
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,890
It seems they’re the biggest of fools.
124
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,650
They won’t stop even if you tried.
125
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,560
At this rate,
we’ll lose two important subordinates!
126
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,230
You’ll recognize it as a special mission
127
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,270
with the goal of investigating
the Village Hidden in Sound, right?
128
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,440
I have no choice, huh…?
129
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,890
But I have a condition.
130
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,810
Bring the two back alive. Got it?
131
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,770
Sure, even if it costs my life.
132
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,980
It’s too dangerous of a mission even
with that Jiraiya going with them…
133
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,940
Sasuke…
134
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,560
That’s the Land of Rice Paddies where
the Village Hidden in the Sound is.
135
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,440
It’s that Orochimaru’s headquarters.
136
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,730
Take sufficient caution and proceed.
137
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,890
It’s kind of anticlimactic…
138
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,310
Here I thought a bunch of
Orochimaru’s followers would greet us!
139
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,060
Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?
140
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,890
It seems to be a peaceful,
quiet and nice land, but…
141
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,650
No, we still haven’t entered
Village Hidden in the Sound.
142
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,730
This is the Land of Rice Paddies.
143
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,890
Land of Rice Paddies?
144
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,020
It’s a small land that’s nothing special.
145
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,400
The feudal lord was a foolish lord who
hungered for powerful military strength
146
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,690
in order to make the land
disproportionately larger.
147
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,890
And then Orochimaru probably won favor
with some fast-talking…
148
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,100
Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn’t
thinking about making the land stronger.
149
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,730
He just had an ambition to make himself
stronger and to carry out revenge…
150
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,520
That’s why there’s nothing in this area
that points to his presence.
151
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,980
Really? And so, Pervy Sage…!
152
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,480
Don’t call me Pervy Sage!
153
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,520
That’s right…
He’s one of the legendary Sannin, so…
154
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,560
He’s just a lady-loving
perverted Pervy Sage!
155
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,890
What?!
156
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,850
More importantly,
where’s the Village Hidden in the Sound?
157
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,560
Beats me… I don’t know…
158
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,520
What?!
159
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,890
We don’t know where it is,
so we’re going to investigate, right?
160
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,770
You’ve got a point, but…
161
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,480
But how do we find it?
162
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,150
There can’t be a place where
people are without food and ladies.
163
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,890
People gather where
there’s food and girls!
164
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,980
– Where people gather, there's news.
– There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.
165
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,230
He’s planning to sow his wild oats
under the guise of a special mission.
166
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,690
First off, finding a traveler’s town with
lots of hot ladies is the top priority!
167
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,310
Every land should have a traveler’s town.
168
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,730
Lodging
169
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,150
This is a traveler’s town…right?
170
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,980
Looks like nobody’s living here anymore.
171
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,890
No, I feel the presence of people…
172
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,270
And the smell of face powder!
173
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,890
– Naruto, take it out.
– Take what out?
174
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,650
Don’t act as you don’t know!
175
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,150
In anything one does,
a war chest is necessary, right?
176
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,770
What! Are you after my wallet? Man!
177
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,890
What?! This shouldn’t be it!
Try jumping!
178
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,890
Huh?!
179
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,890
No! Stop!
180
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,190
One, two, three… Is this all you got?
181
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,730
That’s all of it, really!
182
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,890
– Here… 					– Huh?
183
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,150
It’s not much, but please use it.
184
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,890
No! Sakura, there’s no need for
you to give that to him!
185
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,480
But, it’s money for
gathering information, right?
186
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,890
Right-right. This should be enough.
187
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,560
You guys go on ahead to the outskirts
of the post station and wait!
188
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,560
Wh-Why?
189
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,190
It’s too dangerous ahead from here.
lt’s a mission for adults.
190
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,890
Hmm, the smell of
face powder’s from here.
191
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,440
Welcome…
192
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,560
Along came a sucker just begging
to be parted from his money.
193
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,270
We should be able to pulverize him.
194
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,890
Food and Drink! And young women!
195
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,230
Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,
196
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,190
he’s just going to sow his oats without
gathering any information, anyway.
197
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,890
Sow his oats…?
198
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,310
Y-Yeah…
I don’t really know about it, but…
199
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,850
You know, make-out blah-blah-blah…
200
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,100
It’s fine!
lf I can be of at least some help…
201
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,480
I’m always a hindrance
who can’t do anything, so…
202
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,400
It’s not like that!
203
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,060
In the first place,
if you hadn’t taken the action…
204
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,690
I’d still be tied to the bed!
205
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,890
Brothel
206
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,600
Even in different lands,
there are young women everywhere.
207
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,150
So? Why don’t we move to
the room in the back?
208
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,890
I want to talk more relaxed.
209
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,890
Nice, nice.
210
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,310
Then first, settle up the tab
for here, okay?
211
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,100
What, am I already drunk
on this cheap drink…?
212
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,730
Aren’t there like three too many zeros?
213
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,350
You like to joke, do you?
214
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,190
If you value your life,
leave all you’ve got on you here.
215
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,850
I see how it is.
216
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,650
Master Jiraiya’s late.
217
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,810
I’m sick of waiting.
218
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,440
Naruto!
219
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,270
Who’s there?!
220
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,690
Who’re you?!
Are you one of Orochimaru’s followers?!
221
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,100
What? Was I wrong?!
222
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,890
Damn it.
223
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,730
That kid had erased his presence
until he’d gotten that close.
224
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,020
I won’t let him get away!
225
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,650
Don’t move!
226
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,770
Wh-Why?!
227
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,890
Makibishi Spikes!
228
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,900
Naruto!
229
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,100
Wh-What?!
230
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,940
– Hold it! You jerk!
– We won’t let you get away!
231
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,850
Naruto, what’s that?!
232
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,270
Pervy Sage? What did you do?!
233
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,890
I’ll tell you later!
Anyway, let’s get out of here!
234
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,350
Why?!
235
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,890
Companions of the person just now?
236
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,060
If they’re Orochimaru’s followers,
with my Shadow Clone Jutsu, I’ll…
237
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,060
No, no! Don’t get the wrong idea!
238
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,890
They’re just bodyguards from a rip-off bar!
239
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,890
R-Rip-off bar…?!
240
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,060
First and foremost, this mission has
to be carried out in strict secrecy!
241
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,060
There’d be no point if you were
to use Ninja Art and stand out!
242
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,890
You! Carry the bags!
243
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,810
The one who’s totally standing out
is you, Pervy Sage!
244
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,890
You have a point.
245
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:55,600
This is wrong!
Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!
246
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,560
When I recalled the parts one by one,
247
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,890
I felt as though
I had understood everything
248
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:45,480
Faded words which I kept so close to me
249
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:55,190
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth
250
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,940
and this distant yearning for you
251
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:11,310
I live, simply repeating this cycle
252
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:22,940
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
253
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:33,480
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
254
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,150
I’ll keep these thoughts…
255
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,270
Jeez, this is an appallingly unsettled town.
256
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,190
Well, you guys wait here.
257
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,190
Huh? Why?!
258
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,270
Infiltrating up ahead is too dangerous!
259
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,890
It’s too much for you youngsters.
260
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,890
Pervy Sage…
261
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,690
I myself should be the only sacrifice!
See ya, Naruto.
262
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,020
Blah-blah-blah, trying to look good…
263
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,810
Your scheme to go into
a weird shop again is totally obvious!
264
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,400
Next episode, “A Town of Outlaws!
The Shadow of the Fuma Clan”
//%
1
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,860
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:29,690
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,070
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,240
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,400
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,950
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,820
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,860
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:12,110
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,780
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:28,740
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,900
Damn!
13
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,690
Pretty impressive…
14
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,110
You timed it well to scatter
the three to attack.
15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,820
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,570
Since it is a pretty complicated song…
17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,990
Well…
18
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,030
Not only did you
immediately understand
19
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,240
that I’m manipulating
these guys with my flute
20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,320
but you understood
how difficult this song is.
21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,690
You’re a pretty impressive punk.
22
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,740
But you can’t completely
understand this song.
23
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,740
True… Since art is so foreign to me.
24
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,690
But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,
25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,700
it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns
26
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,820
to control each and every movement
of those guys…
27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,780
I’m pretty confident when it comes
to just analyzing,
28
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,690
but this time it’s not looking good.
29
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,450
The reason is…
30
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,570
I don’t understand
musical notes whatsoever.
31
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,780
Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!
32
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,570
I’ll specially show you
the Camellia Dance next.
33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,700
I’ll crush you!
34
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,450
You shouldn’t say things
you can’t even do.
35
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,030
Shut up!
36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
What?!
37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,820
I told you.
38
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,950
This bone is harder than steel.
39
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,700
You should have a taste of it
with your own body.
40
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,780
Damn!
41
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,690
There’s no one that’s heard
this song and lived.
42
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,490
Finale, Ninth Passage,
Demon Revolution!
43
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,610
The melody’s changed!
44
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,110
Something’s gonna come!
45
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,860
What the--?!
46
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,690
What?
47
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,150
This is…?
48
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,900
The speed at which he flees
after determining
49
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,700
that these Material Ghosts
are dangerous…
50
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,400
Pretty impressive.
51
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,110
But…
52
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,490
I’ve used my precious Paper Bombs
and Smoke Bombs all at once
53
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,450
and all I could do was hide.
54
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,690
That white one…
55
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,690
bit off my physical energy.
56
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,650
Seeing that shuriken passed through,
57
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,690
that thing is semi-materialistic
with very little mass.
58
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,570
It's Chakra itself with an appetite.
59
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,950
It’s probably Chakra that’s shaped
mostly by mental energy.
60
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,240
That’s why it seeks stability
and craves for physical energy.
61
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,150
If I continue dealing with
those “Hungry Chakra”
62
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,690
I won’t be able to build up my Chakra.
63
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,610
They’re pretty dangerous.
64
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,070
She’s a Shinobi who can
make special Chakra like me…
65
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,690
It’s without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu.
66
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,070
Which means I should leave
the white thing alone
67
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,110
and aim for the main body!
68
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,820
The quickest way would be
to stop the sound of the flute, but…
69
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,950
it’d be impossible to get close to
that woman in this situation.
70
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,150
The next thing would be to capture
those three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.
71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,280
But that's difficult too since they’re
attacking me separately at different times.
72
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,150
If I let even one escape
I’d be attacked and it’d be the end…
73
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,780
There aren’t any openings in
either offense or defense this woman…
74
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Heh! She might be
a pretty good Shogi player.
75
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,150
My remaining Ninja tools
are twelve kunai knives,
76
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,700
nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire,
one Flash Bomb and one Paper Bomb…
77
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,990
Man…
78
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,700
I feel like I’m playing without
rooks or bishops.
79
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,690
Did I lose them?
80
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,690
I guess that’s not possible…
81
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Akamaru?
82
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,240
Here. Eat this, Akamaru.
83
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,530
If you don’t eat you won’t
get your strength back.
84
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,900
All right. Akamaru, let’s go!
85
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,360
There’s the issue of those guys too…
86
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,280
Dance of the Camellia!
87
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,400
There’s no use hiding.
88
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,690
Unless you can predict
these guys’ movements
89
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,490
there’s nowhere you can run, little rat.
90
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,570
I’ll find you and break you
into pieces right away!
91
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,820
Now then...
92
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,200
All right. Everything’s ready.
All that remains is to do it.
93
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,240
There’ll be nine attacks.
94
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,280
The outcome will be decided
during the attacks.
95
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
One!
96
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,690
One!
97
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,690
Wishful thinking!
98
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,150
The Jutsu manipulated by
this sound is invincible.
99
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,860
Whatever plans you have
to win against me…is useless!
100
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,780
Two!
101
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,650
Scampering around, you little rat!
Where are you?!
102
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,820
Three!
103
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,490
So you’re over there!
104
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,860
Four!
105
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,030
So it’s a cheap trick.
You think you can make a fool of me?!
106
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,690
Five…six…
107
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,530
seven…eight…
108
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,570
Scurrying around to get away.
What is he thinking?
109
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,690
Light?!
110
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,690
Nine!
111
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,690
Oh no!
112
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,820
He’s lengthened the shadows
with light and …
113
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,780
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
114
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,690
Shadow Possession Jutsu…
a success!
115
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,820
That’s impossible…
116
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,650
How were you able to predict
these guys’ movements?!
117
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,240
There’s no way you could have heard
the differences in my music patterns!
118
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,610
I wasn’t listening to
the sounds at all.
119
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,780
There’s something other
than the sounds
120
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,820
that give away your command patterns,
isn’t there?
121
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,490
Your fingers!
122
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,570
It can’t be!
123
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,820
The movement of the three...
124
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,650
Are you saying you memorized
my finger movements and predicted?
125
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,240
There’s no way that’s possible!
126
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,240
Your right index finger
and ring finger…
127
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,320
The sound that you make
with those
128
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,690
along with the left middle finger
and pinkie,
129
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,070
that middle crab pincher man
stands ready.
130
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,820
Your right thumb and index finger,
131
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,780
and your left index finger and pinkie,
the club man charges.
132
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,990
While you were dodging my attacks
and looking for me,
133
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,650
I was observing each and every one
of your finger moves in detail…
134
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,530
analyzing and memorizing them.
135
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,690
It’s no use…
136
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,690
They’re bound by
Shadow Possession Jutsu.
137
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,450
The most interesting rule
of the Shogi play is that
138
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,780
you can use pieces you obtain
as your own pieces.
139
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,110
From here on out…
it’s my turn to attack…
140
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,650
This time I’ll hunt you down
using the three pieces.
141
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,400
You’re looking pretty composed.
142
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,740
Stand ready with a kunai knife
at least.
143
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,150
My weapon is just this flute!
144
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,320
I told you that there hasn’t been a person
145
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,240
who’s heard the sound of
this flute and lived, idiot!
146
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,200
That’s some confidence!
147
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:11,950
Retreat!
148
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,860
Too bad you aren’t able to
use the pieces, hey!
149
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,110
Next it’s my turn!
150
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,990
What?!
151
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,570
Shadow Possession Jutsu,
successful.
152
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,690
I told you.
153
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,950
That I’d hunt you down
using the pieces.
154
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,030
I used the three pieces as bait.
155
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,700
In attacking, the first hand
is the trick, a fake.
156
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,950
The basics are to score
with the second hand.
157
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
Bastard…
158
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,400
It can’t be helped.
159
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,900
Now that it’s come to this
I’ll need to force out with power.
160
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,900
I didn’t think that I’d get to
second state in a place like this…
161
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,200
It ticks me off but…
162
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,690
I’ll acknowledge it.
163
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,690
This guy was a pretty impressive scum.
164
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,450
What is…this?
165
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,610
It’s true you’re somewhat sharp, but…
166
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,070
It won’t go as
you’ve planned from here!
167
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,570
What?!
168
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,530
Is she gonna force herself out
of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?
169
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,740
What’s with that tremendous Chakra?
170
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,820
The Jutsu’s gonna come loose!
171
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,030
I can’t be worrying about
saving Chakra anymore.
172
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,570
There’s no other way
but to use that Jutsu!
173
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,690
Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
174
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,650
Is he grabbing my body
with the shadow?
175
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,240
It’s just as if I’m being grabbed
by a real hand…
176
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,690
But, no more than this!
177
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,690
Damn! What an incredible strength.
178
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,150
At this distance
I’ll lose to that strength!
179
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,650
Take this!
180
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,700
Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
181
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,650
This is bad!
182
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,110
Is this a…Genjutsu?
183
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,200
Where are you aiming?
184
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,240
I can’t move my body…
185
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,530
While in second stage,
186
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,280
I manipulate many Genjutsu
with my flute.
187
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,360
Of those, this one is
an appropriate for that little rat.
188
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,690
The reason is…
189
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,990
This Genjutsu stops the movement
of the prey and ties it up!
190
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,150
How’s that? How’s it feel to
be the one tied up?
191
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,690
So this was your last move huh?
Unfortunately, it’s a return checkmate!
192
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,150
Little rat!
193
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,950
What…?
194
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,400
This guy...
195
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,690
He broke his own finger
with his own shadow!
196
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,990
Did he release the Genjutsu
with that pain?
197
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,780
On top of that, he kept pretending to
be bound by the Jutsu?!
198
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,400
I told you this already
199
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,650
that the first hand is the trick,
a fake.
200
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,780
The basics are to score
with the second move.
201
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,240
Moreover this second move…
it’s a little different from earlier.
202
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,950
With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,
203
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,690
the closer in distance you are
to the subject the stronger the hold.
204
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,900
Damn. I carelessly got too close…
205
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,950
No, that’s not it.
206
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,690
The most careless thing was
the words you said earlier,
207
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,070
“my weapon is just the flute.”
208
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,690
You’re looking pretty composed.
209
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,400
Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.
210
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,740
My weapon is just this flute!
211
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,690
I told you that
there hasn’t been a person
212
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,860
who’s heard the sound of this flute
and lived, idiot!
213
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,740
No way…
214
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
That’s right.
215
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,570
The reason I threw the kunai knife
right in front of you and missed…
216
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,360
was to lead you to pick it up
and come closer to me, you see?
217
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,360
For the first time, I spoke to you
218
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,490
And you smiled
219
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,780
For the first time, I was able to speak
220
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,690
In my own words
221
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,450
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
222
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,860
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
223
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,690
My clumsy attempts with words
224
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,360
You listened without turning away
225
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,650
No wonder I get carried away by you
226
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,690
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
227
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,740
I feel so sad
228
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,700
But…
229
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,070
For the first time, I spoke to you
230
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,400
And you smiled
231
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,690
For the first time, I was able to speak
232
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,070
In my own words
233
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,450
For the first time, I spoke to you
234
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,700
And you smiled
235
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,200
For the first time, I was able to speak
236
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,200
In my own words
237
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,860
For the first time, I spoke to you
238
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,820
No way, that’s ridiculous!
239
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,200
Am I having a dream or something?!
240
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,490
But it’s too intense to be a dream!
241
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,900
That suit with its outstanding
ventilation and supple fit.
242
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,610
On top of that, those eyes,
that hair, those eyebrows!
243
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,530
You! Why are you here…?!
244
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,150
Next time: “The Leaf’s Handsome Devil!”
245
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,650
I sense the approach of a storm!
//%
1
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,680
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,590
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,220
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,720
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,470
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:46,350
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:55,590
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:15,930
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,100
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,100
I’m exhausted!
12
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,800
Important solo mission, my butt!
13
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,550
They just didn’t have enough manpower
for the castle restoration.
14
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,430
That’s not the job of a Shinobi.
15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,850
Ow-ow… I won’t hold up if
I don’t rest somewhere.
16
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,300
Oh!
17
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,430
I’ll take a bath.
Here I go!
18
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,100
Hey…
I’m sounding like an old man.
19
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,680
Wh-What?!
20
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,640
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
21
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,590
Thank you.
22
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,010
Who the heck are you, mister?
23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,590
I’m a Delivery Ninja!
24
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,140
Please, Mr. Postman!
25
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,640
23, 24, 25…
26
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,260
26…
27
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,050
No mistake…
28
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,760
Thanks to you Mister Naruto,
all of the postal articles are safe.
29
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,430
By the way, what’s a Delivery Ninja?
30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,430
We are postal professionals
who risk our lives
31
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,350
to deliver the important parcels
our customers have left with us.
32
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,680
In other words, you’re a postman.
33
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,550
I am a Delivery Ninja!
34
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,590
Ordinary postmen don’t risk their lives.
35
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,350
So you’re an awesome postman, huh?
36
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,590
That’s right.
37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,590
Oops, I must not keep
my customers waiting.
38
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,590
Then, I’ll be on my way…
39
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,350
Mister! What’s your name?!
40
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,720
I’m 596-03.
41
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,100
A zip code…?!
42
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,260
Anywhere would be fine
if I can get in a hot spring…
43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,890
Cripes…
Here it’s still day time and…
44
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,300
That voice…
45
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,220
My, you’re a strange one, Jira-chan.
46
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,590
Am I?
47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,680
Ah, Pervy Sage!
48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,590
What?! Who’s a Pervy Sage…?!
49
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,930
What’s the meaning of this,
Pervy Sage?!
50
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,350
Hadn’t you left the village
on an important mission?
51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,010
That’s why I was being patient
about you training with me!
52
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,100
If you’ve got the free time to be
doing something like this,
53
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,390
help out with my training right now!
54
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,590
W-Wait, Naruto.
There’s a reason for this…
55
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,220
You probably have some glib lies
about gathering information or something.
56
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,260
You’re wrong, you’re wrong.
lt’s data collection, data collection…
57
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,850
You see…
58
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,350
It’s my final spurt
59
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,600
for the manuscript of the final volume
of “Make-Out Violence.”
60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,590
What about the mission…?
61
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,050
Well, you see, I’m on a mission.
62
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,140
So don’t worry…
63
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,590
What kind of mission?
64
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,760
As it happens, I received information
that a member of the Akatsuki Organization
65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,590
will be visiting this town
the day after tomorrow.
66
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,890
The Akatsuki Organization!
Then, that Itachi will be…?
67
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,220
I don’t know that.
And the same goes for their purpose…
68
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,590
But that’s a matter until
the day after tomorrow.
69
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,640
And so, I’m making effective use
of the free time!
70
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,760
Then it’s perfect.
Give me some training!
71
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,550
Well… you see, they’re so insistent
about the manuscript.
72
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,100
I ended up promising the publisher
that I’d send it today or tomorrow.
73
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,930
Come on! It’s a long-awaited chance
for training.
74
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,590
If my manuscript were
to be completed early,
75
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,180
I might be able to take
some time for training.
76
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,590
Oh, my shoulders are stiff!
77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
There, there.
78
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,890
Oh, I’m thirsty!
79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,470
Here you go.
80
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,640
Hot!
81
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,350
Hey, the ideas I just about had
have blown away!
82
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,600
Enough!
83
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,970
I’m taking a bath!
84
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,220
What a hard Sensei to please…
85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,590
I bet he’s going to say
this is data collection, anyway.
86
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,260
We must deliver that secret document
87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,590
to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs,
no matter what the cost…
88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,930
It seems this is where
the Delivery Ninjas always stay.
89
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,260
Oh, they could…
90
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,220
Delivery Ninja?
91
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,050
I can see them now.
92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
This is all I need for
my writing desire to well up…
93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,470
I’m not getting…inspired with this…
94
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,890
Imagining with your head
is a writer’s job, isn’t it?
95
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,590
I’m a writer rooted in realism!
Getting a picture is important.
96
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,470
So I wonder if you’d do that for me.
97
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,260
Can you write if I do that?
98
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,680
I’ll write, I’ll write!
99
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,680
Sexy Jutsu:
Steam Bath Harem Version!
100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,140
– Master Jiraiya. Jiraiya!
– This is great!
101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,510
Won-der-ful!
102
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,590
What a hopeless guy!
103
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,800
He hasn’t been able to write at all!
104
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,180
Address, check!
Zip code, check--!
105
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,590
Ow-ow-ow…
106
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,430
Oh, the sealed documents…
107
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,640
Please take extra care with this.
108
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,600
I will take it for you.
109
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,350
Ow-ow-ow…
110
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,590
Excuse me, can I also ask you
to take this for me?
111
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,390
Oh! Mister Naruto.
Thank you for helping me out yesterday.
112
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,100
Oh! Mister!
113
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,590
I am 596-03.
114
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,510
It’s hard to remember!
115
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,590
More importantly, I want to ask you
to take care of this!
116
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,930
Hmm…This goes in a different direction…
117
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,300
Have a heart. Please.
118
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,640
Oh, perfect timing.
119
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,680
Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone?
120
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,640
He is 463-72.
121
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,680
This area should be in your jurisdiction.
122
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,180
It is.
123
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,590
Then I leave it to you…
What was it again?
124
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,970
I am 463-72.
125
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,890
Hurry, okay?
126
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,010
Wake up…
127
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,590
Whoa! I fell asleep!
128
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,930
Pervy Sage, let’s start training!
129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,800
What’re you talking about?
I must complete the manuscript…
130
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,760
You don’t need to worry
about that.
131
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,350
I wrote the manuscript and
sent it to the publisher!
132
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,220
So now you can devote
yourself freely to training…
133
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,590
Right, Pervy Sage?
134
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,890
You idiot!
135
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,510
Huh?
136
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,430
If something like this were read,
it’ll be the end of my writing career!
137
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,260
Ah… Oh… I’m sorry.
138
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,640
You said you sent it to
the publisher, right? How?
139
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I gave it to a Delivery Ninja
in the inn…
140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,220
D-Delivery Ninjas.
141
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,430
You mean, the one that delivers any
parcel to the addressee, no matter what…
142
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,800
not influenced by any land or institution…
that iron organization?!
143
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,430
After him, Naruto.
144
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,590
We’ll chase down the Delivery Ninja,
no matter what…
145
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,850
and retrieve your manuscript
at any cost!
146
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,590
If he’s going to the publisher,
he should definitely take this path.
147
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,470
Now what’s left is how to
close the time gap…
148
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,050
I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjas
is extraordinary, though…
149
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,800
Pervy Sage!
150
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,970
Slow down the pace a little, man.
151
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,390
Naruto! This is also training!
152
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,510
To be straight, you’re short on leg power!
153
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,140
A Ninja must apply oneself,
154
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,390
connecting this with training,
no matter what the situation!
155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,140
Excellent, Pervy Sage.
Now you’re talking!
156
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,590
It’s just like a maze!
157
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,720
We’re totally lost…
158
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,590
If we had Hinata’s or Neji’s Byakugan
at a time like this…
159
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,260
Byakugan! I didn’t think of that!
160
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,720
That’s the Rasengan, isn’t it?!
161
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,140
I’m sorry!
162
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,470
Uh, no, you see…!
163
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,680
This isn’t the time to be drooling!
164
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,850
There he is!
165
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,350
After him, Naruto.
166
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,930
R-Right!
167
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,010
Thieves!
168
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,850
Hey, wait!
169
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,970
There’s no fool who’d wait
after being told to wait!
170
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,970
As it happens,
171
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,680
the parcel this person here
left with you this morning is a slip-up!
172
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,430
That’s right!
173
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,510
I have no knowledge of that.
174
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,550
The rule for us Delivery Ninjas
175
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,430
is to deliver parcels once left
with us to the destination,
176
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,220
even if we have to risk our lives!
177
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,590
My life as a writer is also at risk!
178
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,640
Don’t look at me.
179
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,140
This is trouble!
180
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,760
Sorry.
181
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,100
To do that to someone
who’s doing honest work…
182
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,720
Shut up! When you get right down to it,
it was you who…
183
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,590
Huh?! What’s this?!
184
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,600
This isn’t the thing you wrote!
185
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,590
Oh!
186
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,590
That time! It got switched with
my manuscript!
187
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
Say what?!
188
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,680
This is…a secret document directed
189
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,100
to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs
from the Land of Claws…
190
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,350
Let me see…
According to the information I’ve gotten,
191
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,760
the Fang and the Claw could go
to war at any moment…
192
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,220
This is a secret document for peace!
193
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,180
They’ve decided on peace?!
lt’s written here.
194
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,550
That’s a good thing, isn’t it?!
War is no good!
195
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,760
You! You idiot! The fact that
this secret document is here means
196
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,260
the manuscript you wrote is being taken
to the Land of Fangs!
197
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,590
What’ll happen if they read it as
a secret document
198
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,590
from the Land of Claws?
199
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,010
This is bad! No doubt, war will begin!
200
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,100
We’re going to the Land of Fangs!
201
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,600
R-Right!
202
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,100
This time for sure we’ll take back
the manuscript!
203
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,350
Postal thieves…
my customer’s important parcel…!
204
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,640
This is bad!
205
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,140
This is 463-72. This is 463-72!
206
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,510
A postal robbery has occurred!
207
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,640
The thieves are a pair,
208
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,590
a large man with a perverted look
and a kid!
209
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,010
"They appear to be after 596-03’s parcel."
210
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,590
"Members in the area are assigned
to protect 596-03!"
211
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,930
"Stop the thieves in the name
of the Delivery Ninja!"
212
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,140
The only way to get to the Land of Fangs
is to go up this river.
213
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,890
More than likely they will also go
by boat.
214
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,510
Then depending on our speed,
there’s a chance we’ll catch up.
215
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,510
I’m the one who’s got it rough.
216
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,220
You don’t have enough physical strength!
217
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,760
Consider this also as training
and apply yourself!
218
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,970
That again?!
219
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,680
Who’re those guys?!
220
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,600
It appears reinforcements
have been summoned.
221
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,680
Hurry, Naruto!
222
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,760
Naruto! Switch places!
223
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,640
Rasengan!
224
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,510
Rasengan!
225
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,470
Somehow…the Rasengan looks like
a really cheap Jutsu…
226
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,430
It’s for the sake of preventing a war!
227
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,550
Our mission of peace is at stake!
228
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,590
– Right! 					– Switch.
229
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,100
Huh?
230
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,600
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
231
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,720
Rasengan!
232
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,850
Rasengan!
233
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,930
Rasengan!
234
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,720
That’s it!
235
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,260
Hey, wait! It’s a slip-up!
This is the real one!
236
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,180
They got switched during the commission!
237
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,390
Delivery Ninja old man,
it’s the truth!
238
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,470
I’m sorry.
239
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,590
According to our rule,
we are never to look inside
240
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,970
a customer’s parcel we have taken on,
no matter what.
241
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,180
If that passes over to the Land of Fangs,
242
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,600
there will be war!
243
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,930
Even if that were the case,
I must not break the rule.
244
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,970
You’re impossible!
245
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,180
It’s the Land of Fangs!
246
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,590
All we do is carry out our duties!
247
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,760
Then…we’ll take it away
by force if we have to.
248
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,800
– Postal delivery!
– Postal delivery!
249
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,260
Naruto! Do you know which one it is?!
250
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,590
No, I don’t!
251
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,350
I am 596-03.
252
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,600
I know! It’s 596-03!
253
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,430
Where is he?!
254
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,140
Up there!
255
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,100
Naruto, you hold back the front!
I’ll rout the rest!
256
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,590
Got it!
257
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,510
I won’t let you go past here!
258
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,010
In the name of the Delivery Ninja,
259
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,590
I will not let anyone interfere!
260
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,050
You’re an impressive old man…
261
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,140
I too, in the name of the Leaf Ninja,
262
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,590
will take away the manuscript
with a Jutsu!
263
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,590
Let’s go!
264
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,590
Harem Jutsu! Riverside Mad Dance!
265
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,140
Mis-ter De-li-very Nin-ja.
266
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,180
No, no! This isn’t the time to be
doing something like this.
267
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,050
Now, to get cracking with my delivery.
268
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,430
Deliver…
269
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,010
I will deliver.
270
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,890
Hey, where are you going?
Play with me.
271
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,760
No, no! Not that way.
272
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,590
I’ll do my best!
273
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,800
Guys! Give me a hand!
274
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,430
– Right! Yeah. 					– Okay!
275
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,220
P-P-Postal delivery.
276
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,510
Okay, good work.
277
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,600
This guy’s iron will is the real deal…
278
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,140
We’re too late, huh…?
279
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,390
Is war going to start?!
280
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,590
Th-This is--!
281
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,430
It’s a manuscript of the latest issue
of the Make-Out series!
282
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,220
That Land of Claws feudal lord…!
283
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,010
To think he’d know I was a big fan
of the Make-Out series!
284
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,640
Everyone!
285
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,350
Stop the fighting!
286
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,970
Send a messenger to
the Land of Claws!
287
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,600
Don’t let anybody in…
288
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,850
I kind of don’t really get it, but…
with this, there’ll be no war?
289
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,800
No war is fine…
290
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,100
But does this mean my writing power
is the same as Naruto’s scribbling…?!
291
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,590
Now then!
292
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Today’s the day the Akatsuki Organization
guy comes!
293
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,350
We’ll capture him no matter what
and get information about Sasuke…
294
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,010
Pervy Sage?
295
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,590
Sorry, Naruto. There was a development
while you were sleeping.
296
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,180
I will pursue
the Akatsuki Organization as is.
297
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,930
I’ve been had!
298
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,470
Well… I suppose it made for
some good training…
299
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,470
The wind blows, Ah…
300
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,220
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
301
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,720
What should be brought along?
302
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,720
Assemble them into a piece.
303
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
There is no second chance, never
304
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,510
How foolish it is to throw away
305
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,600
Acting so innocently, Ah…
306
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,590
The images.
307
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,590
It probably will not end
308
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,010
It probably will not end
309
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,760
Burn that love-filled heart,
310
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,850
Sail across a thousand dreams
311
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,890
Running freely
312
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,590
To take hold of the world in hand
313
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
The clouds scatter
314
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,590
The sun sets yet again
315
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:36,260
The solo parade begins to move.
316
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,590
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
317
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,970
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
318
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,260
All right, everyone, follow me.
319
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,640
Wait.
320
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,930
We’re heading for
the Village Hidden in Stars
321
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,100
on a mission to protect
a mysterious star.
322
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,720
Naruto!
323
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,260
Man, I’m getting fired up.
324
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,590
We all need to work together here.
325
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,760
Now, let’s all unite and show
the boundless power of the Leaf.
326
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,220
Hey, don’t be following us like
it’s matter of course, Naruto.
327
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,590
You’re not listed as
a member for this mission.
328
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,550
Next time:
“Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name”
//%
1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,690
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,530
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,650
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,950
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,490
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,110
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,690
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,150
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,700
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,740
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,360
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,690
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,820
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:19,690
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,030
Mystery of the Targeted Merchants
16
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,860
Did they really come this way?
17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,820
But why come this way?
18
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,690
They shouldn’t come this way
if it’s as you say, Choji.
19
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,690
I said that because I didn’t think
we were being targeted.
20
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,690
I don’t think this is
the time to argue…
21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,150
We have to formulate
some sort of strategy.
22
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,240
You say that, but…
23
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,110
What is it?
24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,690
Have the guys
you spoke of caught up?
25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,690
Then we should divide up
this group in two.
26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,690
Here it’s hard enough
to protect one.
27
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,690
What’s the point of dividing
the group in two?
28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,820
N-Naruto!
29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,240
Please, tell us what your idea is.
30
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,360
This is what I mean.
31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,200
For example…
32
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,530
Let’s say there are
ten persimmons here.
33
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,450
Is anything okay
if it’s a food?
34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,200
Yeah.
35
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,690
Then I want it to be ramen!
36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Naruto, it’s an example, so…
37
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,530
Then we’ll make it ramen.
38
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,690
Someone is after
these ten bowls of ramen.
39
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,990
And there are three people
to protect the ramen.
40
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,860
And so one person has
to protect roughly three bowls.
41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,360
No, no. If it’s ramen,
42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,700
we should just eat it all
before they come.
43
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,690
That would settle things.
44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,690
N-Naruto. This ramen is
for delivery to someone,
45
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,860
so we can’t eat it.
46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,740
Really? But the ramen
won’t be tasty if it gets soggy.
47
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,400
I’m moving on.
48
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,240
If three people protect
ten bowls of ramen,
49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,700
one person protects
about three bowls.
50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,610
But this ramen has
legs for escaping.
51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,280
Ramen with legs for escaping?!
52
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,450
Five bowls of ramen
quick to escape…
53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,360
and five bowls of ramen
slow to escape.
54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,570
Right, right..
Things are kind of getting crazy.
55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,740
I see. If we divide them
into two groups…
56
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,450
Of course, the pursuers would target
the group that is slow to escape first.
57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,240
So we have one person
defend the preceding group
58
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,490
and two people
for the group that is slow to escape.
59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,780
Right, right.
60
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,030
By doing this, as for protecting
the slow group,
61
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,690
now one person can just protect
two and a half bowls.
62
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,110
Oh!
63
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,150
In other words, the ramen that are
quick to escape are the young people
64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,150
and the ramen that are slow to escape
are the elderly people and children, right?
65
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,650
Exactly.
Not only will the possibility of
66
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,690
the former to completely
get away increase,
67
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,820
the burden on the latter
to protect will decrease.
68
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,990
It’s a strategy that kills two birds
with one stone.
69
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,200
You’re smart.
70
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,780
However…
the elderly people and children will…
71
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,070
I just stated a rational idea.
72
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,700
There’s the possibility
73
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,570
of complete annihilation
if we stay in a group.
74
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,780
Am I wrong, Yurinoshin?
75
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,150
Well…
76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,690
Then it’s settled.
Let’s divide everyone up in two.
77
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,450
I’m sorry, gramps.
78
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,200
Don’t worry about it.
79
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,360
It would be trouble if something bad
were to happen to the men in their prime.
80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,360
You’ve got a wife and kid
at home, right?
81
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Then we’ll be going on
ahead first, Naruto, Choji.
82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,860
Right.
We’re counting on you, Hinata.
83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,280
Naruto and I will deal
with the pursuers.
84
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,690
Right.
I’ll protect them well.
85
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,490
Lady Haruna.
86
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,610
Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut.
What’s your mission?
87
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,110
Is it not to protect me?
88
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,450
Things will be settled if Kikusuke
defeats those guys.
89
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,860
Then shall we get going, too?
90
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,690
I’m counting on you, Brother Choji.
91
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,320
Right! 					Leave it to me!
92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,990
Choji.
93
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,610
You go on ahead.
94
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,700
What?
95
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,400
I’m going back to check things out
at the place where the traps are.
96
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,490
But if you do that, you may encounter
the pursuers along the way…
97
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,690
That’s fine.
98
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,650
Doing something like waiting
to be attacked isn’t my style!
99
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,690
Naruto!
100
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,110
Leave it to me!
101
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,690
I meant…
102
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,690
There’s no point to our strategy
103
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,690
if I have to protect five people
by myself.
104
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Right, there’s no point.
105
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,240
We came down that path,
106
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,740
so the trap should be
up ahead somewhere.
107
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,240
I guess I’ll take a shortcut!
108
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,150
What’s this? 					What happened?
109
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,360
Why is it so wet?
110
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,690
What’re these wounds?!
111
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,450
This guy’s…!
112
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,780
Are you serious?
113
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,280
Is something wrong, Brother Choji?
114
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,690
No, nothing.
115
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,650
I see…
116
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,490
I feel it.
117
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,240
Even I can sense this much bloodlust.
118
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,700
It’s close now.
119
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,690
Huh?
120
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,950
Rain?
121
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,860
This is the worst. Rain wipes out
all presence of the enemy.
122
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,280
Oh…
123
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,610
This rain is weird.
124
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,690
Gather around, everyone!
125
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,360
Stay close to me.
126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,820
What’s…this?
127
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,690
This is bad!
128
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,690
What was that now?!
129
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,780
Everyone! Get under the cart!
130
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,690
We’re already under here!
131
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,740
You’re quick!
132
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,610
Choji!
133
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,690
Naruto!
134
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,490
Get down!
135
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,490
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
136
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,530
Naruto! Could you say so
at the start
137
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,450
if you’re going to
use paper bombs?
138
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,400
All right. It seems they’re gone.
139
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,570
Why did they disappear?
140
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,150
Isn’t it obvious?
141
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,490
They have no business with a shop
that doesn’t have the thing they want.
142
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,280
Thing they want?
143
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,690
That’s right.
144
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,280
If a shop’s sold out
of the item you want,
145
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,400
you’d go to another shop, right?
146
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,990
Could it be that the thing that he wants
is in the other group?
147
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,690
What does that mean?!
148
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,690
Hinata’s in danger!
149
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,690
Everyone, leave your stuff here
and take only what you need!
150
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,070
Hinata is?!
151
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,690
Everyone, we’ll put up our tents here
for today and rest.
152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,690
It’s dangerous to move in the dark.
153
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,990
Hey!
154
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,690
We finally caught up.
155
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,490
Naruto, Choji. What is it?
156
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,690
“What is it,” nothing.
The situation has changed.
157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,690
It seems someone among
these people
158
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,650
is hiding something important.
159
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,950
Something important?
160
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,860
It should probably have something
to do with us being chased.
161
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,030
But who is hiding what?
162
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,900
It’s most likely you guys,
Shun and Yurinoshin.
163
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,200
Don’t be silly!
What’re you saying we’re hiding?
164
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,690
Don’t play innocent!
165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,690
Kikusuke has been killed
by someone!
166
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,150
What?!
167
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,490
Kikusuke was?!
168
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,690
Don’t play innocent!
169
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,900
Kikusuke has been killed
by someone!
170
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,150
What?!
171
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,450
Kikusuke was?!
172
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,400
Why should he have to
suit up like a Shinobi,
173
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,650
fight those guys and then get killed?!
174
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,610
It’s not necessary to tell you guys.
175
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,690
But if that’s why we’re being chased…
176
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,860
It means you guys are putting
everyone in danger.
177
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,360
If you don’t tell us honestly,
178
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,530
we won’t be able to protect
even what we can protect.
179
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,570
Kikunojou…
180
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,320
Kikunojou?
181
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,150
You mean Kikusuke?
182
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,490
Yes… And my name isn’t Yurinoshin.
It’s Yurinojou.
183
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,280
Stop, Yurinojou!
184
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,650
The person here is Lady Haruna,
185
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,240
the only daughter of the feudal lord
of the Land of Greens.
186
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,200
Princess?!
187
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,200
Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens.
You’ve grown up so much…
188
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,950
P-Princess…?
189
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,990
You were a woman?!
190
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,690
Lady Haruna,
it is as these people say.
191
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,860
We must not put everyone in danger
by hiding the truth any further.
192
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,070
But why is someone like a princess
mingling among merchants?
193
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,950
There was information of
a coup in the Land of Greens.
194
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,990
A coup?
195
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,400
The Land of Greens was a small,
but calm and peaceful land.
196
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,690
However, it was by no means
a prosperous land.
197
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,400
Before we realized it,
198
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,690
more than half of the public officials
had been bought off.
199
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,360
Who in the world would do that…?
200
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,820
The ringleaders are three brothers
called the Janin,
201
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,740
evil Ninja who came from
across the sea.
202
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,570
Janin?
203
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,450
Yes. They’re guys who use
a particular type of Ninjutsu
204
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,360
and are called as such
because of their frightfulness.
205
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,280
They’ve taken many lives
and think nothing of it
206
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,150
if it’s for their own gains.
207
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,650
They treat people like worms…
208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,070
But why the Land of Greens?
209
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,610
I don’t know why.
210
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,690
But his lordship had Lady Haruna
hide amongst a group of merchants
211
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,400
and got her out of the land.
212
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,360
Kikunojou and I were left
with the protection of the princess,
213
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,740
but we were insecure with
just the two of us.
214
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,150
So then we hurriedly commissioned
the Hidden Leaf
215
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,030
under the pretext of protection
from bandits.
216
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,690
Why didn’t you tell us
something that important?
217
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,280
There’s no way I could have.
My escape is top secret.
218
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,690
Besides, what would happen
if I were to have told you?
219
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,280
The end result would’ve been
you guys running away in confusion.
220
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,200
No way would I do something
like run away.
221
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,110
Kikunojou might not have
had to die if
222
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,150
we had understood the situation
from the start.
223
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,780
I wonder.
224
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,690
One of you guys might’ve ended up
like Kikunojou.
225
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,110
We’re actually fine.
226
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,360
But to think you’d go so far as to involve
the old lady and the children.
227
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,360
It couldn’t be!
228
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,740
Were you intending to use
the old lady and the kids as decoys
229
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,690
and escape just yourself?!
230
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,150
That’s right. What of it?
231
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,740
Choji! Hinata!
232
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,950
As for me,
I’m really tickedoff right now!
233
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,740
So what of it?!
234
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,240
If something should happen
in the land,
235
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,030
I would become
the only blood relative
236
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,280
of the feudal lord of
the Land of Greens.
237
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,610
If I can just survive,
things could be restored someday,
238
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,820
even if the Land of Greens
were to be destroyed.
239
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,530
Say what?! Just what is it
you think of people’s lives?!
240
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,240
Please forgive her.
241
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,570
Yurinojou.
242
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,030
Is it not your mission to protect me?
243
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,690
You’re still talking about such things…?
244
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,030
Please wait, Naruto!
245
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,110
Lady Haruna, that’s true for me.
246
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,690
However, these people are different.
247
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,450
The mission they undertook
was to protect merchants.
248
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,900
It was not to protect us.
249
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,610
Indeed, what we heard about
250
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,610
was a D-rank mission to protect
all of the merchants.
251
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,690
Protecting a prominent figure of
a land is an A-rank mission.
252
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,490
The rank differs by far too much.
253
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,900
Are you guys saying
you’re going to forsake me?
254
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,030
Weren’t you saying until just now
255
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,400
that you didn’t trust people like us?
256
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,990
I’ll protect you with my life,
Lady Haruna…
257
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,530
Shut up, Yurinojou!
Kikunojou was your senior disciple.
258
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,690
There’s no way you alone
could defeat an opponent
259
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,690
whom he couldn’t defeat!
260
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,490
That will just be our destiny
when that happens, Lady Haruna.
261
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,450
Watch, Brother Choji.
262
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,820
Oh! Awesome, awesome.
263
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,690
I’m sorry about earlier.
264
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,570
It happened so suddenly,
I couldn’t stop.
265
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,950
Don’t be concerned about me.
266
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,700
However, please forgive Lady Haruna.
267
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,690
The Land of Greens is a small land.
268
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,650
For the sake of the land’s survival,
269
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,650
Lady Haruna was kept under
the custody of another land,
270
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,280
as a hostage all by herself
since she was little.
271
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,820
Hostage?
272
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,360
It frequently happens in
a small land in a war-torn world.
273
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,240
When Lady Haruna returned
from the other land,
274
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,820
she had completely lost her feelings
of trust towards people.
275
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,240
Lady Haruna is also
a victim of a turbulent world.
276
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,570
There’s a village
277
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,610
about one league down
the mountain from here.
278
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,700
For the time being,
279
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,150
we’ll leave the old woman
and the others there.
280
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,110
Be careful now.
281
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,860
You guys, too!
282
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,690
Bye!
283
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,740
Why are you separating them from us?
284
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,860
They still have value for
my personal use.
285
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,200
Are you still going on about that?
286
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,740
They went so far as to discard
their merchandise for your sake.
287
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,690
Then we should also leave this place.
288
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,820
We must not.
289
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,320
If we go into hiding,
290
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,820
there’s a possibility of
that group being attacked again.
291
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,690
Exactly. This time,
it’s our turn to be the decoy
292
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,950
in order to protect them.
293
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,690
Do as you like!
294
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,650
Hinata, I’ll take care of things here.
Please rest a while.
295
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,110
Yeah, do that.
296
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,740
Th-Then, if you insist.
297
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,200
Oh, yeah. Here.
Kikunojou was holding this.
298
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,150
Thanks, Naruto.
299
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,820
Kikunojou was a master
of the Flower Ninjutsu
300
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,950
passed down in the Land of Greens.
301
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,450
We learned together
when we were little
302
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,900
and I couldn’t beat him even once…
303
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,780
Now I have forever lost
the chance to beat him.
304
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,690
No… You still have a chance.
305
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,780
What?
306
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,110
If you beat the guy
who defeated Kikunojou,
307
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,570
you will have beaten Kikunojou!
308
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,690
Naruto… You’re exactly right…!
309
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,900
Here they come!
310
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,690
Other than the fact that
the enemy uses water,
311
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,690
we have absolutely no idea
what they’ll come at us with.
312
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,690
I know.
313
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,820
Go! Flower Ninja Art:!
Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage.
314
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,360
What?!
315
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,070
He changed the trajectory in mid-air?!
316
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,450
Oh, no!
317
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
I finally got you!
318
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,030
Gotcha.
319
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,400
To think you’d
make me look like a fool.
320
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,030
So you finally show yourself.
321
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,570
I will avenge Kikunojou!
322
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,860
Try it if you can.
323
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,360
I won’t let you get away!
324
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,400
Too bad. You’re one person short.
325
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,070
I’ve set a share for one more.
326
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,690
I don’t know about that.
327
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
First, I’ll take care of you, boy.
328
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,780
Water Style: Liquid Memory!
329
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,690
Naruto…!
330
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,360
And this!
331
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,320
Summoning Jutsu!
332
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,200
What is it?
333
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,280
Is that…?
334
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,070
The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?!
335
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,280
Vanish and die!
336
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,650
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
337
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,240
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
338
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,740
Yellow Moon.
339
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:59,690
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
340
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:04,780
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
341
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:11,740
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
342
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:18,690
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
343
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:25,570
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
344
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:32,280
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
345
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,860
A magical chord change, in a restless city
346
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,900
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
347
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,150
What is this huge thing?
348
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,900
I don’t wanna become its food.
349
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,740
Let me tell you one thing.
I’m not tasty.
350
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,950
I’m not tasty, either.
351
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,610
But Choji would be more
worthwhile to eat.
352
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,690
No, Naruto would be tastier.
353
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,070
Be eaten for the sake of your comrade.
354
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,690
You’re the one who will
become it food.
355
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,570
This isn’t the time to be arguing
about stuff like that.
356
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,280
Yurinojou!
357
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,950
Anyway, we just have to run
with all our might for now!

Next time:
“A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools”
//%
1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,690
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,630
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,900
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,310
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,980
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,710
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,580
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,460
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,730
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,600
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,370
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,340
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,810
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,380
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,890
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,590
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,600
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,590
This is good!
21
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,100
Bit by bit,
I'm figuring out the timing...
22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,670
He read my movement.
23
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,040
No way could he do that!
24
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,610
Darn! 					We were so close...!
25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,250
Naruto, can you still move?
26
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,680
Of course! I'm totally fine!
27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,590
He's pretty much spent...
and it's no wonder.
28
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,720
Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of Chakra.
29
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,660
But thanks to him,
we found our way out.
30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,000
I found the way to break through!
31
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,600
Hah! Impossible!
32
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,640
That was just a coincidence.
33
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,740
Naruto! Run!
34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,250
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!
35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,020
A-All right!
36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,420
You won't be able to…!
37
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,600
I-I'm not going to lose!
38
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,500
There!
39
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,540
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
40
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,300
Darn!
41
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,700
T-That was good just now!
42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,570
What?
43
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,870
We're doing it one more time!
44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,540
All right!
45
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,150
It's likely that there's a limit
to that guy's Chakra, too!
46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,580
To prove that,
he's little by little…
47
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,630
This won't go as you've planned.
48
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,600
First, I'll get you!
49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Sasuke!
50
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,080
Darn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.
51
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,590
And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...
52
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,000
Be calm…Think...
What will he come after?
53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,500
Oh no!
54
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,080
What?!
55
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,520
Too late!
56
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,870
The Broken Seal
57
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,570
That was Sakura's voice!
58
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,570
Did something happen?
59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,780
What's that Kakashi doing?
60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,580
Sa…kura…
61
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,350
Darn it… I must do something…
62
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,630
I'll do something about it…
63
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,430
T-This guy...
64
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,600
Here I go…
65
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,430
It's pointless to struggle.
66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,290
Naruto, behind you!!
67
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,090
Naruto!
68
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,400
It's impossible for you
to get out of here.
69
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,660
I mean it.
70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,830
Can you stand up, Naruto?
71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Y-Yeah…
72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,870
From now on,
don't waste your Chakra!
73
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,810
You're playing right into his hands.
74
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,510
I know.
75
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,150
Darn it!
76
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,350
If things continue like this,
it's going to be really bad.
77
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,650
I...
78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,620
I have to do something.
79
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,790
Strangely, my eyes have adjusted…
80
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,130
It's about the time I put
an end to this for you…
81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,830
What?!
82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Stand up, you idiot!
83
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm aiming for a vital spot...
but he's parrying all of them .
84
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,850
I know…
you're so persistent!
85
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,400
A coincidence…
No, that's not it.
86
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,930
On the contrary, he's fighting
while covering for his friend.
87
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,940
Surely, my movements…
88
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,410
That boy…he can see something.
89
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
What in the world...?
90
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay, in that case...
91
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,390
He disappeared.
92
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,590
Where, where did he disappear to?!
93
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,390
Naruto! Don't faint!
94
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,390
I can't take care of you
any more than I am now!
95
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,400
Who asked you to take care of me...
96
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,800
It seems that kid has
reached his limits.
97
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,710
Tsk...
98
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,050
Amazing…
That's an amazing move.
99
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,080
You move well…
100
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,590
Wha--?!
101
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,460
But I'll stop you
with the next one.
102
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,960
Motor function...
103
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,130
Reflexes...
Ability to judge a situation...
104
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,340
All of these things…
should be at their limits!
105
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,570
He's coming!
106
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,840
Calm down…
107
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,340
Focus!
108
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,680
And … 					See everything!
109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,260
He saw through absolutely everything?!
110
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
No way…
111
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,510
Those eyes…
112
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,280
It can't be…
113
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,680
Sharingan…
114
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,790
You are…
115
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,860
Only a little, but...
116
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,430
I was able to see!
117
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,300
So, you also have the power
of Kekkei Genkai…
118
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,570
What a kid…
119
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,700
It's not perfect yet,
120
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,810
but to think that in the middle of a battle
he was able to rouse this power…
121
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,580
If that's the case,
I can't fight him too long…
122
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,080
This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
123
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,590
There are also limits to retaining
the teleportation speed.
124
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,930
Besides, the longer the fight continues,
125
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,600
the more my movements will enter
into the range of his "reading."
126
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,570
In fact, his eyes
have already captured me.
127
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,810
It would be foolish to aim
straight at him.
128
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,140
In that case…
129
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,220
I'll use that kid to lure him in!
130
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,590
What?!
131
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,220
Let me make it in time!
132
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
K-Kakashi Sensei!
133
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,040
You were late entering
to guard, Kakashi.
134
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,010
Your whole-hearted intent to help
those kids has gone to your head,
135
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,580
and it seems to have clouded
your Sharingan
136
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,350
with even heavier fog.
137
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,390
Even though you have
those impressive eyes,
138
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,720
your ability to read your enemy's
movements is getting cloudy.
139
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,130
Amuse me more, Kakashi…
140
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,200
I want to repay my debt in
an amusing way.
141
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,980
Don't worry. Anytime now,
Haku is going to defeat those kids.
142
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,020
You better apologize to them
in tears
143
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,220
when you are in "the next world"
for your lack of strength.
144
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,960
Sasuke will be defeated…?
145
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,230
That's not true!
146
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,230
Sasuke is…
147
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,600
Cha!
148
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,770
Not by that guy!
149
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Cha!
150
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,640
He won't be defeated!
151
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,440
Cha!
152
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,640
Naruto won't either!
153
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,910
That's right.
154
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,780
Huh!
155
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,450
I...believe in their strength.
156
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,390
Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive,
Knucklehead Ninja…
157
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,330
And Sasuke is a member of
the most excellent clan
158
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,770
in the Hidden Leaf Village!
159
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,500
That can't be!
160
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,870
Yes…
His name is Sasuke Uchiha…
161
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,580
He bears within his body...
162
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,180
the famous Kekkei Genkai
of the Uchiha clan!
163
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,580
He's a Ninja genius.
164
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,190
He's the remaining survivor
of that tragic clan?!
165
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,100
No wonder he grows so quickly.
166
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,570
But...
167
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,940
That's the same as Haku.
168
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,650
Nobody has ever beaten
that secret Jutsu of Haku's
169
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,680
Not one person in the past…
170
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,090
Well then…
171
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,220
It's about time I settled this too, huh.
172
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,660
Sakura, don't move from here.
173
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,530
Uh... ah…okay!
174
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,570
No, I'm going to put
an end to this!
175
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
For God's sake, you…
176
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,960
just won't quit…
dragging my feet, will you?
177
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,060
You did it! 					Sasuke...!
178
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,170
W-What kind of expression
is that…
179
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,180
You…idiot…!
180
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
W-Why?!
181
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,590
You protected me…?!
182
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,290
How the hell…should I know?
183
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,590
Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!
184
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,160
Hmph…
185
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,160
You...
186
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,900
I hated you…
187
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,300
Why? Why…?
188
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,540
Why…me…?
189
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,680
I didn't ask for your help!!
190
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,920
I don't know…
191
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,660
My body moved…of its own accord…
192
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,600
Fool…!
193
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,880
Sasuke!
194
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,580
That man…
195
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,250
Until I defeated…my brother…
196
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,930
I absolutely refused to die...
197
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,590
That's what I decided, but...
198
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,340
You, don't die…
199
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,570
He…
200
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,390
To protect someone dear to him…
201
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,960
he would plunge in
knowing it was a trap…
202
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,600
He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.
203
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,700
Is this the first time you faced
a friend's death?
204
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,640
This is the way of the Shinobi…
205
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,580
Shut up!
206
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,590
Even though I...
hated you too…
207
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,040
I won't forgive you…
208
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,760
I'm going to kill you!
209
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,000
What is this Chakra?!
210
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,640
It can't be…
211
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,180
For Chakras to be tangible like that…
212
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,090
A-And…what a ghastly Chakra that is…
213
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,170
The wound on his hand…
lt's healing instantly…
214
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,170
This boy…
215
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,340
Who in hell is he…?
216
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,950
Is it Zabuza…?
217
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,360
No!
218
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,790
This sinister Chakra was once…
219
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,460
It can't be!
220
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,030
What is…this Chakra?
221
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,330
It feels foul…
222
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,510
Kakashi?
No, it's too big to be Kakashi's…
223
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Who is it?
224
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,580
Naruto…!
225
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,020
Oh no…
226
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,590
At the time like this…
227
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,290
The seal has broken…?
228
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,460
I have to hurry!
229
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,630
He's coming!
230
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,570
How dare you!
231
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,870
You ruined Sasuke!
Damn you!
232
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,580
Sasuke's dream…
233
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,980
What about dream?!
234
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,520
Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!
235
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,590
Because of your dream…!
236
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,590
Next time:
"The White Past: Hidden Ambition"
//%
1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,160
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,160
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,370
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,790
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,450
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,200
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,990
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,830
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,200
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,000
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,500
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,870
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,830
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,290
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,870
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,370
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,990
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,330
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,250
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,830
Hey, you!
21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,330
Are you sure you want
to look like that?
22
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,870
Yes, of course!
C'mon! So hurry hurry!
23
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,040
Don't regret it later.
24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,990
Say cheese!
25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,250
My Name Is Konohamaru!
26
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,410
I couldn't decide on how to look.
27
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,000
It took me 3 hours to decide.
28
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,450
But as you can see,
it's more like a work of art.
29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,990
Doesn't it look great?
30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,410
Take it over.
31
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,580
What?!
32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,160
Take it over.
33
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,830
Stop saying that!
34
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,750
Transform!
35
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,990
Oh please, Lord Hokage…
36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,290
The Sexy Jutsu…
That's quite a devious technique.
37
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,830
By the way Naruto,
where's your headband?
38
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,660
I won't wear it until the orientation.
lt might get scratched
39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,950
Well, that's just fine.
40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,580
But the Ninja Registration Form
is a very important document
41
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,540
held in high regard by our village.
42
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,250
Why do you want to look like this?
43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,370
Because!
44
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,200
Anyway, how should I know
about all that stuff?
45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,080
Old man!
Get ready to fight!
46
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,950
I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!
47
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,700
Ouch!
48
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,660
If it's not one thing, it's another….
49
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,990
Drat! Is this a trap?
50
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,620
Are you okay,
Honorable Grandson?
51
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,990
May I just inform you that
there aren't any traps here…
52
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,750
Huh? What's with this runt?
53
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,450
What?!
54
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,250
I know this kid…
He's that Nine-Tailed boy!
55
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,990
He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!
56
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,620
You must have done this to me!
57
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,830
You tripped all by yourself, stupid!
58
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,330
Hey! Let go of him!
59
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,790
He is the Honorable Grandson
of the Third Hokage!
60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,990
He stopped as soon as
he learned who I am….
61
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,990
He's like my four-eyed teacher.
62
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,870
He's just like everyone else!
63
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,950
What's the matter?
64
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,580
Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?
65
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,290
Can't do it 'cuz
I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?
66
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,990
As if I care! 					lmbecile!
67
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,620
This guy…
68
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,080
What?!
69
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,540
Good grief…
70
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,750
Listen to me.
71
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,990
You are the Honorable Grandson
of the Third Hokage.
72
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,290
Even though that scoundrel hit you,
you must not associate with his kind.
73
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,410
Nothing good will come of
your tangling with him.
74
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,990
This is your distinguished
teacher Ebisu,
75
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,870
and I am never wrong
about these things!
76
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Don't you want to become
the Fifth Hokage?
77
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,700
Then allow me
to teach you Ninjutsu,
78
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,870
so that your dream will
become a reality.
79
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,080
That's right.
80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,910
Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut
towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
81
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,750
Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?
82
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,830
He's gone!
83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,120
It seems he's gone after Naruto.
84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,990
Oh no!
85
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
This is terrible!
86
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,120
Honorable Grandson!
87
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,450
How did he become like this?
88
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,040
That was the 20th sneak attack today.
89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,120
And now he's in the company of Naruto.
I'm a bit worried.
90
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,330
I just hope he doesn't pick up
more foolishness.
91
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,700
Huh?
92
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,540
Stop following me!
93
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,620
What is it now?!
94
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,750
Your camouflage is pathetic.
95
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,910
You've seen through my disguise...
96
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,990
Your reputation is well-earned.
97
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,700
I will allow you to make me
your apprentice.
98
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,870
But you must first teach me that
"Sexy Jutsu"  technique
99
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,990
you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.
100
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,290
You gotta be kidding.
101
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,120
I beg you to say yes, boss!
102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,990
Huh?
103
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,200
Boss?
104
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,990
Boss! Boss! Boss!
105
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,410
I guess I have no choice.
106
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,990
Listen.
107
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,370
In order to become a skilled Ninja,
108
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,990
you must first learn to
control your Chatora.
109
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,410
Chatora?
110
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,830
Yes, Chatora.
111
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,990
Boss, I think you mean Chakra.
112
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,990
Silence!
113
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,450
That's what real Ninjas call it!
114
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,990
Oh! I didn't know that!
115
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,910
Whew… I'm glad he's a fool.
116
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,990
Listen. Chakra essentially means…
117
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Basically, it is the energy needed
in order to use Jutsu.
118
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,580
Huh?
119
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,580
In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts
combine the Chakra,
120
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,500
the physical energy accumulated
from each cell in the body
121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,540
with spiritual energy intensified
through training and experience.
122
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,040
This combined energy is summoned
with certain hand signs.
123
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,580
You made me think
you knew all that,
124
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,990
when you were just reading
from a scroll!
125
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,950
Much has been said about
perfecting the Ninja techniques,
126
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,990
but it really boils down
to just one thing.
127
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,620
And what is that?
128
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,990
Hard work and guts.
129
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,160
Hard work and guts?
130
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,410
That's right.
131
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,250
So be ready for the challenging tasks
I will give you.
132
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,990
Yes, boss!
133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Good. Let's start right now.
Transform for me.
134
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:17,990
Huh?
135
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,370
Let me see first
how much you already know.
136
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,450
But what do I transform into?
137
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,500
OK... First, transform into that lady.
138
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,700
An easy task, boss.
139
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,370
Transform!
140
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,990
Well, do I look like her?
141
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,160
Uhm… Well, the clothes do and…
142
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,620
And what's so similar
about that?!
143
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,250
Honorable Grandson.
144
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,990
If you will transform into me,
at least try to look a little cuter, OK?
145
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,620
She's scary!
146
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,910
Why am I the one who gets hit?
147
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,620
OK!
Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!
148
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,990
Yes, boss!
149
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,990
I told you I don't allow
reading here, Naruto!
150
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,870
This is the last test.
Put all of your effort into it!
151
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,410
Yes, boss!
152
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,080
Transform!
153
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,370
Naruto! It's you again!
154
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,160
Why is it always me…?
155
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,250
Sorry.
156
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:16,990
Huh?
157
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,910
It's because
I'm the Hokage's grandson.
158
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,990
Don't worry about it.
159
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,790
Huh?
160
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,660
You're now ready to perform
the Sexy Jutsu!
161
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,000
You just need more practice.
162
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,700
Yes, boss!
163
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,370
OK, keep in mind…
the point is for "boom boom boom"!
164
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,410
Now do it!
165
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,950
Yes, boss! 					Transform!
166
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,910
What do you think?
167
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,040
That won't do!
168
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,290
More slender.
169
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,540
Yes, boss!
170
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,620
Is this okay?
171
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,790
Not yet. 					More attractive.
172
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,990
Yes, boss!
173
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,120
How about now?
174
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,950
That Naruto… What is he teaching
the Honorable Grandson…?
175
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,500
Where the hell could they be…?
176
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,990
I am a distinguished teacher
training potential Hokage.
177
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,540
All those who interfere
will be eliminated.
178
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,990
You know I've been wondering…
179
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,250
You seem obsessed with beating
your Grandpa Hokage.
180
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,870
My name is Konohamaru.
181
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,990
It was Grandpa who gave me
that name.
182
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,540
He named me after our village.
183
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,250
It should be easy for everyone
here to remember.
184
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,410
But nobody ever calls me
by that name.
185
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,950
When they see me, all they see
is the grandson of Lord Hokage.
186
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,620
No one sees me for who I really am.
187
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,580
I can't stand it anymore.
188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,790
That's why…
189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,120
That's why I want the title
of Lord Hokage now.
190
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,370
Idiot…Who do you think
will accept you, huh?
191
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,160
Huh?
192
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,040
You won't win the title
that easily, you know.
193
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,990
What?!
194
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,620
It's not that simple.
195
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,330
If you're really serious about gaining
the title of Lord Hokage…
196
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,450
What?
197
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,990
You'll have to beat me first!
198
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,990
Lord Hokage!
I've been looking for you.
199
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,500
Iruka.
200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,990
Did Naruto re-submit
his Ninja Registration Form?
201
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes.
202
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,660
When I lectured to him the other night
at the ramen stand,
203
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,990
he said he will make everyone accept him
now that he's a Ninja.
204
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,290
He's been happy since then.
205
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,990
It might not be easy for Naruto
to realize that dream.
206
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,790
Huh?
207
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,830
As you well know,
208
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,990
only the villagers who fought
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago
209
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,410
know that the monster is sealed
inside Naruto.
210
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,290
I ruled that no one shall speak
about that incident.
211
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,160
I have severely punished those
who have broken this rule.
212
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,790
Now our children know nothing about it.
213
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,990
That is the only positive
development for Naruto.
214
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,990
Before the Fourth Hokage trapped
the monster and died,
215
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,990
his last wish was for the villagers
to regard Naruto as a hero.
216
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,120
A hero?
217
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,700
The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster
into the navel of a newborn baby
218
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,620
whose umbilical cord
had just been cut.
219
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,990
As the receptacle
for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
220
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,450
Naruto saved the village.
221
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,990
Unfortunately, the other villagers
don't see him like that.
222
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,580
Some even say that Naruto is
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.
223
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:02,200
Little by little, that attitude has been
passed down to their own children.
224
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,160
Iruka. 					Do you know?
225
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,330
What, sir?
226
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,620
When someone is hated and people refuse
to accept his existence,
227
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,990
he sees it in the eyes
of the people around him.
228
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,370
I have found you!
229
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,250
Huh?
230
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,370
That Demon Fox!!
231
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,410
That cold look!
lt's always like that!
232
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,990
Honorable Grandson,
we have to go now.
233
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,990
No way!
234
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,990
I want to beat Grandpa right now
so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!
235
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,790
Don't get in my way!
236
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,000
A Hokage must first know about virtue,
honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,
237
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,830
judgment, obedience
and all that.
238
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,290
He must be skilled at more than
thousand techniques…
239
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,990
And then...
240
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,790
Transform!
241
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,160
Take this! Sexy Jutsu!
242
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,950
What? 					lt didn't work!
243
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,540
What kind of a
disgraceful spell is that?!
244
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,700
I am a gentleman!
245
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,660
Such vulgar attacks
will never work on me!
246
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,700
Honorable Grandson!
That rascal will only make you an imbecile!
247
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,870
Stick with me and...
248
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,040
you will gain a shortcut
towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
249
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,990
C'mon, let's go!
250
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,950
No way!
251
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,700
Shadow Clone Jutsu
252
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,330
Wow! 					Fantastic!
253
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,700
Ha! 					That's nothing.
254
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,290
I am a distinguished teacher.
255
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,990
I am not as weak as Mizuki.
256
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,410
Boss…
257
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,080
Transform!
258
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,040
Transform!
259
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,580
Oh, Master Ebisu…
260
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,990
I call it "the Harem Jutsu"!
261
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,990
He combined the Multiple Clones with
his own Sexy Jutsu.
262
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,250
That's another devious attack.
263
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,370
I probably won't even survive that one.
264
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,990
I can't even beat that
four-eyed teacher of mine!
265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,990
I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!
I want to be recognized by everybody!
266
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,990
But I keep failing.
267
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,580
You think it's that easy?
268
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,290
Huh?
269
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,330
It's given only to the greatest Ninja
in the village.
270
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,580
Everybody must learn to believe in you.
271
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,620
I've been through a lot already.
272
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,870
It's been one struggle after another.
273
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,990
But after all that,
I found someone who accepts me.
274
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,370
I had to go through a lot...
Just for one person.
275
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,990
You had better push yourself.
276
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,290
For what?
277
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,040
The path of getting the title,
Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.
278
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,080
There's no such thing as a shortcut.
279
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,540
If you're really serious about
attaining the title of Lord Hokage
280
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,080
You'll have to beat me first.
281
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,620
Who do you think you are,
lecturing me like that?
282
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,540
I won't be your apprentice anymore.
283
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,620
From now on, you're my rival.
284
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,330
Unfortunately for you,
tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.
285
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:51,910
Still, I'll consider you an equal someday
when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.
286
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,330
Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.
287
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,990
You still have a long way to go
to become a real Ninja.
288
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,990
Aaah! Why do I have to be in
the same group with Sasuke?
289
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,540
The guy I hate the most?
290
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,790
Sakura keeps saying
"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!"
291
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,500
and doesn't even
pay attention to me!
292
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,990
It makes me so mad!
I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!
293
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,750
I'm not gonna let him be so cool
in front of Sakura!
294
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,500
Next Episode:
"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?"
295
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,120
Watch my outstanding performance!
//%
1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,820
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,930
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,200
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,610
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,280
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,010
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,820
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,660
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,030
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,830
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,330
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,700
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,670
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,110
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,680
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,190
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,820
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,830
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,900
Rockin' my heart
20
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,820
Today's…a special day, so…
21
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,290
Time to eat!
22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,830
Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?
23
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,800
Fight me, here!
24
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,040
What're you doing, Konohamaru?
25
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,580
Very good, Naruto…
26
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,510
You're the man I expected you to be.
27
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,120
I didn't do anything, you know…
28
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,990
Let's fight fair!
29
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,320
Sorry! I've got
an orientation meeting to go to.
30
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,530
An orientation meeting…?
31
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,500
Cause… As of today, I'm a Ninja!
32
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,930
Oh…
33
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,620
Sakura!
Shouldn't you be heading out soon?
34
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,720
I was thinking of leaving now!
35
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,830
Cha! How long are you planning
to treat me like a child?!
36
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,330
That's right… I'm not a student
of the academy anymore…
37
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village,
Sakura Haruno!
38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm off!
39
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,380
Morning, Sakura.
40
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,580
Morning... Ino.
41
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,960
Who would've thought you'd
be able to graduate.
42
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,400
Ancient history has nothing to do with it.
43
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,030
As of today,
we're both full-fledged Ninjas...
44
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,800
I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!
45
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,230
What the--? Why are you here?
46
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,200
Today's meeting is for graduates only.
47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,830
Hey, don't you see this headband?
48
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,340
As of today, I'm a Ninja, too!
49
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,480
How can I put it, it really suits me.
50
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,180
So Naruto…was able to graduate.
51
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,990
Goal!
52
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,730
I won again, Sakura!
53
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,930
What're you saying…?
54
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,800
The tip of my foot got in
one centimeter faster!
55
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,210
You must be blind.
56
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,810
It's Sakura.
57
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,010
Oh…
58
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,120
Sakura's looking at me…
59
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,450
Hey, Sakura!
60
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,620
Mor... morning, Sakur--
61
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,520
Get outta' the way!
62
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,830
M-Morning, Sasuke…
63
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,570
Mind if I sit next to you?
64
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,240
Hey! I'm going to sit
next to Sasuke!
65
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,770
First come, first served!
66
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,870
I got in the classroom sooner!
67
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,810
I did!
68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,340
If that's the case,
then I did!
69
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,280
I was first!
70
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,650
I'm sitting next to Sasuke!
71
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
How annoying...
72
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,620
Is that this year's top rookie,
Sasuke Uchiha?
73
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,090
Yes.
74
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,960
The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan?
75
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,130
Yes.
76
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,940
Naruto Uzumaki, eh…
77
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,830
Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!
78
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,700
Sakura…
79
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,200
Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke.
80
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
What's so great about this guy?!
81
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,740
Just beat him up, Sasuke!
82
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,810
Yeah! Yeah!
83
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,240
What? Really?
84
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,710
Oh! Sorry!
85
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,650
Wha--?
86
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:50,980
Whoa!
87
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,560
Cha! I was planning on
seizing Sasuke's first kiss!
88
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,870
You jerk…
Naruto! I'll kill you!
89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
– My mouth is rotting.
– Huh? Was that my fault?
90
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,870
What? I feel rage…
91
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
Naruto…
92
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,210
You…
93
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,750
An accident…
lt was an accident
94
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,620
You are annoying!
95
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,820
Yikes!
96
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,820
Naruto…He's at
the center of trouble as usual.
97
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,830
As of today, you all have become
full-fledged Ninjas…
98
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,400
However, you're still Genin.
99
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,370
The tough part's still to come!
100
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,170
From here on, you'll be in a squad of three
101
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,640
and carry out your missions
under your Jonin teachers.
102
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,510
A squad of three?!
103
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,180
I wonder who's going to be
grouped with Sasuke.
104
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,320
I don't know…
105
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,160
Cha! I'll be the one grouped
with Sasuke, naturally!
106
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,830
Squads of three, eh.
lt'll just slow me down…
107
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,200
First will be Sakura.
108
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,540
And the other person…
109
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,810
can be anyone other than Sasuke!
110
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,340
The groups have been determined
111
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,080
so that the strength of
the groups will be balanced.
112
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,380
Now for the assignments!
113
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,350
Now then, next is Group Seven…
114
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,290
Naruto Uzumaki!
115
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,820
Sakura Haruno.
116
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,830
Hooray!
117
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,830
I'm with…Naruto…?
118
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,900
And…Sasuke Uchiha!
119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,700
Hooray!
120
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,830
I'm with…Sasuke…?
121
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,210
So I'll be in a different group
from Naruto, huh…
122
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,810
Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga!
123
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,810
Y-Yes…
124
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,480
Kiba Inuzuka!
125
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,920
Shino Aburame!
126
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,220
Why is this happening…?
127
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,620
Group Nine.
128
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,090
Cha! Love will be victorious!
129
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,130
Man…
130
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,500
Why do women think that
kind of guy's so great…?
131
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,870
Don't you understand, Shikamaru?
132
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,770
Well, I'm not a woman…
133
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,080
That's why you are
not popular among girls.
134
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,710
I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.
135
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,920
Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka.
Shikamaru Nara.
136
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,620
It appears we've been
grouped together.
137
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,390
And Choji Akimichi.
138
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,930
And Fatty on top of that...
139
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
That's all for the group division.
140
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,340
Iruka Sensei!
141
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,440
Why does an exceptional student
like me have to be
142
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,580
in the same group with this guy?!
143
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,280
Sasuke has the best grades
of the graduates.
144
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,080
Naruto, you're at the bottom!
145
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,120
Of course, this is how it is when trying
to balance the strength within groups.
146
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,330
Just don't get in my way, loser!
147
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,160
Hey, what did you say?!
148
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,400
You want to fight, loser?
149
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,830
Knock it off, Naruto!!
150
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,770
In the afternoon,
I'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers.
151
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,110
You're dismissed until then!
152
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,080
Sasuke!
153
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,910
Where'd you go, Sasuke?
154
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,820
I thought since we're in the same group
and all, we'd eat together.
155
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,590
Sakuraaaa!
156
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,620
Since we're in the same group and all,
let's eat together!
157
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,460
Why should I have to eat with you?!
158
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,630
Well... we're in the same group, so…
159
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,830
You're…annoying.
160
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,800
Sasuke! Where are you?
161
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,650
Darn! This is no fun.
162
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,180
I 'm finally in the same group as Sakura…
and then it's like this…
163
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,190
I wonder if something good will happen…
164
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,530
That's it!
165
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,810
Listen up!
166
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,650
As long as we're in the same group,
you will follow my instructions.
167
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,410
Yeah-yeah…
168
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,920
She becomes a real pain in the neck
when people try to argue with to her, so…
169
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,790
Let's all go out for
some BBQ sometime.
170
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,490
Oh, man…
171
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,360
Hmm?
172
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,830
Naruto…?
173
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,630
Huh?
174
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,230
Oh!
175
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,340
Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it!
176
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,940
Darn! Just be quiet.
177
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,440
Naruto! I won't forgive you
if you hurt Sasuke!
178
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,590
What happened?
179
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,160
Heh! Idiot…
180
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,170
So Naruto got beaten by
the one he challenged…
181
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,570
Of course! Naruto's no match
for Sasuke!
182
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,110
No need for me to feel rushed…
183
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,110
From here on out,
184
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,820
I'll be in the same group as
Sasuke for the long haul…
185
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,520
But…
186
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,090
Even if I were to use
my feminine charms…
187
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,160
my proportions are below average…
188
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,160
All that's above average is
the width of my forehead…
189
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,230
What should I do…?
190
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Huh? No way!
191
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,670
Sasuke…is looking...
192
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,770
this way!
193
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,710
And with such a passionate look!
194
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,820
You…have a charmingly wide forehead.
195
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,820
It makes me want to kiss it.
196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,820
That's what its surface area is for.
197
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,830
Yeah, right…
198
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,460
I'm not just some kid
who believes in fairy tales…
199
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,330
There's no way.
200
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,870
You…have a charmingly wide forehead.
201
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:51,900
What?!
202
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,910
It makes me want to kiss it.
203
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,620
Cha! This fairy tale is for real!!
204
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,820
Or that's what Naruto would say.
205
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,830
I've got something to ask you.
206
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,090
What?
207
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,860
What do you think…of Naruto?
208
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,840
He's quite at home interfering and
enjoys it when I make mistakes.
209
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,740
Naruto doesn't understand
one thing about me…
210
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,810
He just annoys me!
211
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,590
All I want…is for you to
accept me, Sasuke.…
212
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
For me to accept you…?
213
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,230
I'll do anything for the sake of that.
214
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,710
I was careless!
215
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,620
W-Wha--?!
216
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,490
Gotcha!
217
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,590
I didn't think someone who couldn't
perform the Clone Jutsu properly
218
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,360
could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
219
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm…desperate, so…
220
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,670
I finally know why I…
221
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,410
I like Sakura so much.
222
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,580
Diarrhea at a time like this?!
223
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,790
What's wrong?
224
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,520
I-I'll be right back…
225	01:41:53:26	01:41:56:04
Sasuke's so shy!
225
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,560
I guess he needs to
prepare himself mentally…
226
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,410
That was close!
227
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,640
My stomach hurt so much that
the Jutsu was about to wear off!
228
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,610
Why does my stomach have
to hurt at such a good time?!
229
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,020
I'm annoying... huh…
230
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,820
She said so again…
231
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,720
And I transformed into Sasuke and
had got a little closer to Sakura…
232
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,830
In that case…
I'll play an obnoxious Sasuke …
233
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,030
and make her hate him!
234
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,880
Oh Sasuke,
you're such a shy bad boy!
235
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,910
Are you prepared? I'm raring to go!
236
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,920
H-Hey, Sasuke!
237
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,420
Where's Naruto?
238
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,420
Oh, there you go changing
the subject again…
239
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,030
Just leave Naruto alone!
240
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,360
All he does is pick fights with you!
241
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,830
It's because he wasn't raised right!
242
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,230
You know!
243
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,200
He doesn't have any parents, right?
244
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,810
He always selfishly does
whatever he wants!
245
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,780
My parents would get mad at me
if I did something like that!
246
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,480
There are no parents to nag you
if it's just you alone!
247
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,480
So his selfishness comes
out at various times!
248
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,750
The loneliness.
249
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,650
Huh?
250
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,860
It's something worse than getting
scolded by parents and...
251
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,960
W-What's gotten into you…?
252
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,730
You…
253
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,830
annoy me.
254
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Darn! It finally stopped!
255
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,580
I wonder if Sakura's still waiting.
256
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,960
W-What are you doing here?!
257
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,900
I used the Escape Jutsu,
the very basic of techniques.
258
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:12,830
Oh...
259
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,560
What were you planning to do…
260
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,830
by transforming into me?!
261
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,800
I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try!
262
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,580
The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?!
263
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,710
I'll show you that I'm really amazing!
264
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,210
I'll defeat you…
265
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,180
and make you accept me!
266
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,520
Prepare yourself, Sasuke!
267
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,460
Just like that, my stomach again…
268
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,330
B-Bathroom!
269
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,960
I'm first, I say!
270
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,060
I'm first, I say.
271
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,830
I'm about to go in my pants, I say!
272
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,940
How stupid!
273
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,670
"You annoy me" …huh?
274
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:03,410
I see. So this is how
Naruto must've felt…
275
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,090
I wonder if I can…
be a bit more nice next time…
276
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,590
Darn.
277
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,020
Did I eat something bad?
278
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,730
Naruto…
279
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,830
Smile…Smile…
280
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto.
281
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,800
Sakura…
282
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,410
Payback for earlier, huh?
283
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,740
Sasuke's turned himself into Sakura…
284
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,780
You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?!
285
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,910
I don't think so!
286
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Ow-ow-ow…
What the heck is going on?!
287
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:44,960
Oh…
288
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,330
You idiot, Naruto!
289
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,740
So, this is Naruto's room…
290
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,540
And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is
also in the group you'll be in charge of.
291
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,940
I wish you good luck!
292
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,080
The expiration date…
293
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
of this milk has passed quite awhile ago…
294
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,160
He'll get sick if he drink this.
295
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,790
It seems like that things are
going to get disastrous.
296
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,500
What the heck is going on?!
297
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,800
What is going on?!
298
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,540
This isn't the same Kakashi Sensei
from yesterday.
299
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,740
Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei
300
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,610
who got caught in my trap
and breezily came late?
301
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,580
Darn it! Darn it!
302
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,210
No way am I giving up!
303
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,820
I'll defeat him and clear
this super difficult testl!
304
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,490
No way am I going back now!
305
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,420
Next episode:
"Pass or Fail: Survival Test"
306
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,730
Don't miss my outstanding performance!
//%
1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,760
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,700
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,970
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,370
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,040
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,780
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,580
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,560
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,790
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,600
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,100
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,470
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,440
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,870
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,450
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,660
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,670
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,550
Is this the first time you
have faced a friend's death?
21
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,590
This is the way of the Shinobi…
22
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,830
I won't forgive you…
23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,580
I'm going to kill you!
24
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,850
White Past: Hidden Ambition
25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,390
There's murder in his eyes!
26
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,860
He looks nothing like he used to!
27
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,590
He's coming!
28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,330
What?
29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,270
His Chakra repelled my attack!
30
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,340
Then…
31
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,420
This should do it!
32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,360
Why?!
33
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,600
It can't be!
34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,370
Could... Naruto's seal
have been broken…?!
35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,140
No.
36
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,210
This feeling…
37
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,250
True, the seal is almost off
38
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,580
and the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed
Fox Spirit is escaping, but…
39
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,590
Fortunately, the seal is not
completely broken!
40
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,590
I still have some time!
41
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,790
Do you hear me, Zabuza?
42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,900
We're both busy people.
43
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,800
I know it's against your style,
44
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,870
but I think it's about time
we stopped playing around.
45
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,570
Why don't we settle this once
and for all with the next move?
46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,580
Interesting.
47
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,910
What can you possibly
do in this situation?
48
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,650
Kakashi, go ahead. 					Show me.
49
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,590
No good…
50
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,890
I can't hold his aura down!
51
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,570
Zabuza…
52
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,710
I can't defeat this boy.
53
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,590
Zabuza…
54
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm…
55
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,590
You…from that time…
56
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,590
Why?
57
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,790
Why stop?
58
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,570
Even though I killed your dear friend,
you can't kill me?
59
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,410
Damn it!
60
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,760
What happened to the
force from moment ago?
61
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,590
You can't defeat me with
that kind of strength.
62
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,770
Wasn't he someone
special to you?
63
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,640
Is there someone special
in your life?
64
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,210
I want to protect someone
special to me.
65
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,210
I want to make that
person's dream a reality…
66
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,510
That's my dream.
67
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,750
Many people misunderstand.
68
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,590
They pity and don't finish off
the enemy they ought to finish.
69
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,960
They let them survive.
70
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,760
To me, that isn't compassion
or anything.
71
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,130
Do you know?
72
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,340
How it feels to
not be needed by anyone?
73
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,110
To live day to day without a dream.
The pain of it all.
74
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,580
What are you saying?
75
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,420
Zabuza has no use
for a weak Shinobi.
76
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,020
You took away
my reason for existence.
77
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,990
Why?
78
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,260
Why do you have to
serve a guy like that?
79
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,490
He gets the money from thugs
to do bad things!
80
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,330
Is that No-Brow
the only person special to you?
81
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,840
A long time ago,
I had other people special to me.
82
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,010
They were…my parents.
83
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,850
I was born in the Land of Water,
in a small village heavy with snow.
84
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,590
My parents worked on a small farm.
85
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,660
We were very poor,
86
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,130
but my parents seem to
be satisfied with it.
87
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,660
I was happy then…
88
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,530
They were loving parents.
89
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,970
But…
90
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,840
When I was old enough
to understand things,
91
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,580
something happened.
92
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,080
Something?
93
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,980
What happened?
94
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,850
My blood…
95
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,490
Blood?
96
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,990
Go on!
97
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,600
Tell me what happened.
98
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,330
My father…
He killed my mother.
99
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
Then he tried to kill me.
100
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,440
Huh?!
101
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,140
After the experience of
the ceaseless civil war,
102
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,580
people with Kekkei Genkai were
hated and feared in the Land of Water.
103
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,920
Kekkei Genkai?
104
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,590
It's special powers or Jutsu
passed on through certain clans,
105
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,590
from parent to child,
or from grandparent to grandchild.
106
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,330
Because of their special powers,
107
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,830
those of the clans were exploited in
all sorts of battles.
108
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,570
As a result, all Kekkei Genkai
were feared
109
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,340
as harbingers of disaster
and death.
110
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,350
After the war was over,
111
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,120
they decided to hide
their special powers.
112
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,420
If anyone knew of their secret,
only death could be expected.
113
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm sure that boy went through
so much suffering as well.
114
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,570
The greater your power,
the more you were feared.
115
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,240
My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.
116
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,480
She kept it secret from my father.
117
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,350
She hoped that for a while…
118
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,180
No, she must have thought that
they could have a simple life forever.
119
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,460
Look, Mommy! Look!
120
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,590
Isn't it fantastic?
121
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,600
Not you, too!
122
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Why? Why him, too?
123
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,600
That hurts, Mommy!
124
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,140
Sorry…
125
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,710
I'm sorry, Haku…
126
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,550
I'm sorry!
127
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,050
However…
128
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Father had discovered our secret.
129
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,880
When I came to…
130
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,590
I had killed my own father.
131
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,260
And that moment,
what I thought of myself was that…
132
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,600
no, that is what I had to think.
133
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,670
And then knew that it was
the most painful thing.
134
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,700
The most…painful thing…?
135
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,440
That I…
136
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,580
that my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world.
137
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,050
Same with me.
138
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,550
You told me that...
139
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,220
You'll be the best Ninja in the village,
and make everyone respect you.
140
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,760
If someone comes along and
accepts you for who you are,
141
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,570
no one could be more important
to you than that person.
142
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,970
Even though he knew I was from
a clan with Kekkei Genkai,
143
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,580
Zabuza took me in.
144
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,220
My power that everyone hated...
He wanted it, needed it.
145
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:34,290
Brats like you won't be needed
by anyone and die like dogs.
146
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,530
You have the same eyes
as I do…
147
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,470
Brat…
148
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,880
Do you want…
to be needed by someone?
149
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,390
Are you willing
to give everything for me?
150
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,770
From now on,
your power belongs to me.
151
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,150
Come with me.
152
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,460
I was so happy…
153
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,590
Haku, bad news.
154
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,930
I have to leave the Land of Water
as of tonight.
155
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,670
However, I'll be back in
this land some day.
156
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,710
I will rule over this land.
157
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,410
To do that...
158
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,050
what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.
159
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,720
What I really need is…
160
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,950
I already know.
161
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,590
You have nothing to fear.
162
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,260
I am your weapon, Zabuza.
163
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,590
Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.
164
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,600
You're a good boy!
165
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,770
I apologize, Zabuza.
166
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,210
I wasn't good enough to be
the tool you were looking for.
167
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,580
Naruto!
168
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,020
I want you…
169
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,990
to kill me.
170
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,140
Ninja Art, Summoning,
Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
171
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,210
Whatever you do won't work!
172
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,080
You have absolutely no idea
where I am now.
173
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,350
However…
174
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,390
I know exactly where you are
and what you're about.
175
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,660
Kakashi…
176
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,100
You are completely
in my hands now.
177
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,880
W-What is that racket?
178
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,020
What... Just what's going on out there?
179
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,960
If you can't use your eyes or ears,
simply use your nose.
180
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,890
That's what happens
181
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,660
when you're closing your eyes
in the midst of fog.
182
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,100
This is the Summoning Jutsu
specialized for pursuit.
183
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,600
I deliberately shed my own blood
184
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,240
to stop your attacks both times
for this.
185
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,080
Your weapons have a thick scent of
my blood on them now.
186
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,020
Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.
187
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,250
And their sense of smell
is without equal.
188
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,590
You're the one who
was playing into my hands.
189
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,590
The fog has lifted already.
190
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,600
And your future is… 					death.
191
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,930
I've had enough of your bluffs!
192
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,570
Don't act tough!
193
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,540
There's nothing you can do
in this situation.
194
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,180
Your death is certain.
195
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,510
Zabuza.
196
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,580
You were too full of yourself.
197
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,680
You're too ambitious
for your own good.
198
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,000
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.
199
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,570
You left the service with
few men under you,
200
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,600
and became a Rogue Ninja.
201
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,580
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.
202
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,550
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.
203
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,680
And you needed to hide from
204
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,580
the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.
205
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,590
Isn't that about the reason
206
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,120
why you hired yourself out
to scum like Gato?
207
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,420
Zabuza.
208
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,630
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just Sharingan?
209
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,630
Here's something I didn't copy,
a Jutsu of my own…
210
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,140
To enlighten you!
211
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,850
Lightning Blade!
212
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,950
What the…?!
213
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,620
His hand is visibly overflowing
with Chakra!
214
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,600
You are too dangerous.
215
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,100
Tazuna, the man you are trying
to assassinate
216
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,770
is the symbol of courage in this land!
217
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,370
The bridge he is building
is the hope of this land!
218
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,910
And your ambitions will sacrifice
countless lives.
219
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,750
That isn't how a Shinobi
is supposed to behave.
220
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Who cares?
221
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,990
I have always fought
for my own ideals.
222
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,760
And that will never ever change!
223
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,760
I'll say it again.
224
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,930
Huh?
225
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,830
Give up.
226
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,310
Your future is… 					death!
227
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,510
Please kill me.
228
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,350
What are you hesitating for?
229
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,020
No…
230
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,720
What you said is ridiculous!
231
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,260
You're a weapon?
Just a tool for him?
232
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,590
How can you call him
special to you?
233
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,300
Are you really okay with that?
234
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,270
Is that wrong?
235
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,200
Huh?
236
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,570
Tell me, what is wrong with that?
237
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Well, uh…
238
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,540
It's not…
239
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,580
Zabuza counts on me,
even if I'm worthless.
240
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,080
He made me feel needed.
241
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,220
But now, I've lost my usefulness
that affirmed my existence.
242
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,220
Zabuza no longer needs me.
243
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,730
That's why,
I am now appealing to you.
244
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,030
Please, make it quick
245
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,170
W-Why did this happen?
246
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,440
Is this what it means to
be a strong Ninja?
247
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,580
To protect someone?
248
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,050
Are you okay with that?
249
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Are you really okay with that?
250
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,590
I don't get it.
I can never accept that!

Next episode:
"The Weapons Known as Shinobi."
//%
1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,490
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,410
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,490
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,830
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:34,370
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,000
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,490
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,040
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,580
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,620
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,250
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,500
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,700
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,490
A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools
16
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,160
Naruto!
17
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,290
Naruto!
18
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,620
You’ve come back, Choji!
19
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,870
Yay!
20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,490
Are you okay, Naruto!
21
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,870
I’m okay, but I’m not okay
with your heavy weight!
22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,120
I’ll get him right away!
23
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,830
Stop it Choji!
lt doesn’t work on him!
24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,490
What?
25
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,410
This water absorbs all the shocks and
it gives me an iron-wall defense.
26
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,490
Oh, really?
27
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,490
Shoot!
28
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,700
Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!
Myriad of Flowers!
29
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,490
I’m saved.
30
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,410
Where’d that guy go?!
31
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,490
After a bonfire, you should put it out.
32
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,200
There is a limit to your Kunai Knife,
33
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,490
but my water that the earth
gives me is infinite.
34
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,040
His Ninjutsu is endless.
So for now…
35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,700
Wanna run away?
36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,910
Say that you’ll withdraw!
37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,750
You can’t get away.
38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,500
Summoning Jutsu!
39
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,540
After them!
40
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,160
This way!
41
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,580
If you get caught by that water,
it’s over for sure!
42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,660
It’s coming around from
this side too.
43
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,750
It’s trying to trap us!
44
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,490
Run! Run! You’re all going to
get eaten if you get caught!
45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,750
At this rate, we’re eventually
going to be defeated.
46
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,660
Looks like we’ve gotta beat him up,
after all.
47
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,450
But how are we going to beat him
48
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,160
if the attack doesn’t work on him?
49
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,490
Damn!
50
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,370
Huh?
51
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,750
Don't you think
there's something weird about him?
52
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,000
Wh-What is?
53
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,490
Hmm… I wonder?
54
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,200
Don’t be joking at a time like this!
55
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,330
Perhaps, is Naruto talking
about his tonfa?
56
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,450
Oh yeah, he’s holding his tonfa
like a dowsing rod.
57
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,330
That’s it!
58
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,540
It’s called dousing.
59
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,700
If you concentrate on the item
you’re looking for,
60
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,830
it will react to that item and inform you
when you get near it.
61
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,580
Dowsing?
62
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,490
I see! Naruto, Choji!
63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,370
We might have a chance to win!
64
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,290
Huh?
65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,620
If that tonfa is the secret of
this Jutsu then…
66
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,490
Naruto!
67
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,490
Let’s rap up the chase!
68
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,490
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
69
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,660
Idiot.
70
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,370
I’m not going to let you get away!
71
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,540
I've got you!
72
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,370
Seems like you tried to get close to me,
but too bad
73
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,910
Damn it!
74
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,490
I’m going to prepare
a special one for you.
75
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,580
Wh-What Naruto?
76
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,580
Hurry up and run, Choji!
77
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,540
Yurinojou!
78
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,870
Yurinojou! Choji!
79
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Choji!
80
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,830
Behind you!
Look behind you!
81
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,620
I said look behind you!
82
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,500
Choji!
83
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,490
Choji!
84
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,490
The fight is over.
85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
First, the big one,
I’ll eat you first.
86
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,160
Certainly the fight is over.
87
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,580
A fight where you’re going to lose.
88
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,540
What?!
89
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,250
Right now Choji!
Drink up the water!
90
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,290
Useless, useless.
91
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,160
Water will gush out from the ground
with no limits.
92
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,750
Why isn’t the water coming out?
93
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,790
Like I said, it’s useless.
94
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,490
What happened?!
95
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,200
The water that will protect
you will not come out of here.
96
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,490
Look carefully at the surroundings..
97
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,490
Yes, water does not come out
of this craggy place.
98
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,500
I’m full!
99
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,450
Yurinojou has realized your secret.
100
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,490
I also thought something was strange.
101
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,450
When I went to check the trap,
102
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,870
I decided to take the shortest route
through the craggy area.
103
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,080
It wouldn’t have been strange
to run into you there…
104
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,620
but that didn’t happen.
105
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,750
The answer to that is easy!
106
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,870
You made a detour because
you avoided craggy areas
107
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,200
where the water wouldn’t come out.
108
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,500
The tonfa you hold is a weapon
109
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,870
and was a way to find the water
through dowsing.
110
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,120
You lost them and you went away
from your advantageous places.
111
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,790
You mean… The reason why
you cracked my tonfa was…
112
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,450
Of course, it wasn’t a coincidence.
113
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,160
It was planned by Yurinojou who
calculated your actions.
114
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,870
Damn it…!
115
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,490
This one will be heavy because
of the water!
116
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,490
Human Boulder!
117
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,490
You did it! Choji!
118
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,330
Yurinojou!
119
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,160
My ribs are injured, but…
I’m okay.
120
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,830
But there should be three of them,
so hurry and get the princess!
121
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,080
I got it!
122
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,950
Choji, please take care of Yurinojou.
123
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,750
Okay!
124
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,080
I’ll catch up to Hinata!
125
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,290
Let me rest a little.
126
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,830
I got it.
127
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,950
Let’s wait for everyone here.
128
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,450
There’s no need to wait.
129
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,080
After we rest a little, you are going
to take me to a safe place.
130
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,540
But Naruto and the others are not yet…
131
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,330
That doesn’t matter!
132
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,450
In the first place, everything became
like this because of you guys.
133
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,250
Instead of taking the long way,
134
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,370
if we had used the merchant people
as decoys,
135
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,950
then we would have escaped by now!
136
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,580
Decoys…?
But Kikusuke has already…
137
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,750
What about it?
138
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,000
If your mission as Ninja is to risk
your life in the line of duty,
139
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,750
then Kikunojou should be satisfied.
140
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,040
Even though Kikunojou is dead,
141
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,370
if I am still alive, then it’s possible to
revive the Land of the Green.
142
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,370
Princess.
143
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:34,120
Hinata, you won’t understand how
I was separated from my parents
144
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,490
to be held as hostage in
a foreign country
145
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,410
and how much I was bullied.
146
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,080
I realized then that only fools would expect
to live off of human compassion.
147
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,490
Especially someone like Naruto
148
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,830
who is easily influenced by
people’s emotions
149
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,490
should be disqualified as a Ninja.
150
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,830
He loses his rationality in his goal.
151
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,490
Princess, what do you know
about Naruto?
152
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,870
Naruto has lived without his parents
since he was a child.
153
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,490
He has always lived alone.
154
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,790
To be accepted by everyone,
to become the next Hokage…
155
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,250
he has worked hard…really hard…
156
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,580
Despite all that, he didn’t give up
157
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,490
and he would never think of
living at the expense of others.
158
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,080
He tried and tried.
159
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,790
Naruto and I are in different positions.
160
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,490
I’m sorry. You’re right, Princess.
161
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,490
Hinata… Do you like Naruto?
162
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,500
I understand.
163
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,580
Let’s wait for everyone here.
164
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,120
Princess…
165
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,290
That bag must be heavy.
166
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,500
I will relieve you
of some of the burden.
167
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,290
Oh, thanks.
168
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,040
I cannot die in a place like this.
169
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,160
Don’t you look nice, Ruiga.
170
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,790
Jiga… Help me… Brother…
171
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,500
Whatever.
172
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,490
If you die, Brother Renga and I could
split the Land of Green’s profits.
173
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,490
Jiga…
174
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,410
Don’t blame me.
175
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,040
W-Wait!
176
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,160
S-Stop Jiga…!
177
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,500
Hinata!
178
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:12,910
Hinata.
179
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,410
N-Naruto…
180
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,790
Where is the Princess?
181
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,330
That’s what I was going to ask!
182
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,370
I said let’s wait here and the minute
I turned around…
183
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,700
Why does a Ninja like you
get beaten by an amateur?
184
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,080
S-Sorry.
185
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,910
Then right now she should be alone…
186
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,490
Naruto, we should first go back
to the village
187
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,490
and get advice from the Hokage.
188
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,200
No!
There’s no time for that.
189
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,620
There are still two Janin left.
190
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,120
She’ll get killed if she gets caught.
191
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,490
But this really isn’t an official mission.
192
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,120
We might not be able to
handle the other two…
193
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,790
You’re right…
194
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,250
As you say, this may not be
an official mission but…
195
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,830
she’s trying really hard to escape
by herself right now.
196
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,370
The things she says and does
may be wrong,
197
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,750
but somehow,
I can’t leave her alone.
198
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,490
Naruto, I’ll also…
199
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,290
Hinata!
200
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,490
Yurinojou got hurt.
201
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,500
You and Choji,
please take care of Yurinojou!
202
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,490
See you later!
203
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,250
Oh!
204
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,700
Be careful, Naruto…
205
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,000
Right there!
206
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,290
I see, you have good instincts.
207
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,910
I’ll praise you for getting Ruiga.
208
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,450
Are you the second Janin?
209
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,790
Oh, I feel honored that you know
about me.
210
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,120
Then you should brag about it
in the other world.
211
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,450
That Mr. Jiga killed you,
so it couldn’t be helped.
212
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,750
Shadow Clone Jutsu.
213
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,200
What?
214
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,330
That wouldn’t work.
215
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,490
This guy…
216
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,580
What kind of Ninjutsu is he using?
217
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,490
A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh?
How interesting.
218
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,910
I’ll put them down as
one of my next targets.
219
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,490
I won’t let you do that!
220
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,250
How did…?
221
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,950
Yup.
222
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,200
My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet.
223
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,580
It’s like this!
224
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,500
I will live, no matter what…
225
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,410
This is your graveyard.
226
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,290
I will return those words
right back at you.
227
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,490
You!
228
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,490
Then.
229
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,410
There!
230
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,490
Damn! 					What’s going on?!
231
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,040
What should I do?
I can't find Choji.
232
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,370
I'm sure that he's somewhere
hiding his presence, but…
233
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,660
This is… Naruto’s forehead band.
234
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,830
Naruto…
235
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,830
I grew up drinking iron.
236
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,580
That’s why I can use the iron
237
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,540
that has accumulated in my body
and turn myself into a magnet.
238
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,910
This rocky mountain contains
lots of iron,
239
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,330
making it my invincible battle-field.
240
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,290
Change yourself into magnet…?
241
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,000
By the way, I could also change
the things I touch into magnets.
242
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,490
I’ve already changed the rocks behind you
into powerful magnets.
243
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,620
So what are you trying to do?!
244
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,490
I mean this!
Ninja Art Magnet: Infinite Meteors!
245
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,200
Second hit! Third hit!
246
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,490
Naruto!
247
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,910
Your friend… I’ll take good care of her.
248
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,040
Hinata! Don’t come!
249
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,870
He is…
250
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,490
He is…a dangerous…opponent…
251
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,870
Naruto!
252
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,490
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
253
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,200
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
254
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,700
Yellow Moon.
255
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:57,540
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
256
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,750
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
257
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:09,700
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
258
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,580
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
259
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,490
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
260
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:30,250
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
261
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,830
A magical chord change, in a restless city
262
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,870
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
263
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,290
What should I do?
264
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,290
My Gentle Fist won’t work against
his Ninja Art.
265
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,830
It’s frustrating, but I can’t win against him
if I fight him head on.
266
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,290
At this rate, Naruto will…
267
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,750
No, no, I won’t let that happen.
268
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,950
I will discover the weakness
of his Jutsu.
269
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,410
I won’t give up!
I’ll stop him, no matter what!
270
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,830
Next time:
“The Byakugan Sees the Blind Spot!”
271
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,250
I’m going to risk everything
in this single attack!
//%
1
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,600
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,590
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,140
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,640
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,390
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:46,260
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:55,590
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:06,510
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:15,850
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,010
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,590
Mess up the village…you say?!
12
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,600
I won’t let you do that
no matter what!
13
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,550
I mean, there’s no way
just the four of you can do that!
14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,590
But, we can…
15
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,470
A person who knows village matters
very well gave us information
16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,720
on where and how to attack.
17
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,220
Knows village matters very well…
18
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,590
It couldn’t be!
19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,550
You mean Orochimaru?!
20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,850
Who knows…?
21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,760
Well, that’s how it is,
so we can’t have you guys living.
22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,760
Umm, can you see this?
23
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,050
Paper Bombs!
24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,930
We’re going to detonate
the Paper Bombs
25
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,140
after we’ve left here…
26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,890
There’s nowhere to run…
27
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,260
There’s no chance of someone
coming to save you.
28
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,590
Prepare yourselves.
29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,260
It’s better than going back
to the Academy, isn’t it?
30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,390
Umm, rest in peace.
31
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,850
H-Hey! Just a minute!
32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,930
Farewell, real me.
33
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,430
Run, Dodge, Zigzag!
Chase or be Chased!
34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,510
It should’ve just been
hunting for treasure,
35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,390
but to think this would happen…
36
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,470
Sure enough,
nothing good comes
37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,930
of being together with you
on missions, Naruto!
38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,350
This isn’t the time to be
saying stuff like that!
39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,430
They’re attempting to mess up
the Leaf Village by impersonating us!
40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,550
Then how’re we going
to get out of here?!
41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,510
Well…
42
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,390
If I use the Rasengan,
I could somehow…
43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,180
They’d notice that!
44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,590
It’d be the end if we were
to get ambushed outside.
45
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,390
Then, with your Fang Over Fang…
46
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,300
That’d be the same, the same!
47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,590
You moron!
48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,260
Then what should we do?!
49
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,350
– Umm… 					– Huh?
50
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,590
If I use
my Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms…
51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,850
I get it!
52
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,590
With that we can weather this crisis
without the guys outside noticing!
53
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,550
If I could just loosen
these ropes a little…
54
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,680
Leave that to me!
55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,680
N-Naruto?!
56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,100
All right!
57
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,510
Me, too!
58
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,680
Kiba…
59
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,350
Akamaru…
60
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,800
Just a little more…
61
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,640
It snapped…
62
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,220
Protective 8 Trigrams…
63
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,970
64 Palms!
64
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,890
Now then,
shall we go as arranged?
65
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,760
– Kiba! 					– Yeah!
66
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,100
– Hinata! 					– Yes!
67
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,180
Naruto!
68
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,010
I know!
69
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,590
Hinata!
70
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,430
You okay?
71
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,640
Oh…!
72
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,640
What…?
73
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,390
Hey, Hinata!
Cut our ropes before you faint.
74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,350
Right.
75
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,680
It seems the guys outside
are gone.
76
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,930
It doesn’t look like this place
is going to hold up now.
77
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,760
It looks like it’d be best for us
to escape as soon as we can.
78
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,350
What’s that?!
79
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,970
It’s the buried treasure chest.
80
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,100
Leave it be!
81
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,590
It’s a fake anyway.
82
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,010
And there might be
some kind of trap set.
83
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,510
But it’s our mission to
take this back with us, so…
84
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,720
There really might be
buried treasure in it, right?!
85
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,850
Byakugan!
86
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,970
It looks empty inside…
Wait, there’s paper inside.
87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,260
Isn’t it a Paper Bomb?
88
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,140
It doesn’t seem to be
anything dangerous…
89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,550
Then I guess I’ll take it for now.
90
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,350
Come on, there’s no need
to go to the trouble of…
91
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,800
But it might make for a good mark
to distinguish him from the imposter…
92
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,220
I get it.
93
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,680
Akamaru, you’re the mark for
the real me, so stay close to me.
94
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,590
There’s no time.
95
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,890
I’ll be going with our Fang Over Fang.
Make sure you keep up!
96
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,260
R-Right.
97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,010
Man-Beast Clone…
98
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,510
Fang Over Fang!
99
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,590
You okay, Hinata?
100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,590
I’m fine… I just have to follow
after Kiba, so…I’ll be o…
101
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,590
Hinata!
102
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,470
All right!
103
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,220
You okay, Hinata?
104
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,850
Naruto!
105
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,600
Does your leg hurt?
106
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,050
Kiba…
107
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,800
If your leg hurts, say so first.
108
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,470
I was thinking
I must not cause trouble, so…
109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,930
Actually, that is trouble.
110
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,510
I’m sorry…
111
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,760
Surprisingly, this might be
the weakness of our team.
112
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,850
Huh…?
113
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,970
Hinata shows too much
concern for us.
114
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,390
Naruto and I speak too bluntly to
each other and we get into fights…
115
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,590
N-Now that you mention it…
116
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,640
If we’d take on our missions while
being a little conscious of stuff like that,
117
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,850
we might…
become a pretty good team.
118
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,350
Got it!
119
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,050
I’ll try…
120
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,590
All right. Then Naruto and I will go
after those guys.
121
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,390
Hinata, you come later.
Your leg’s hurt, so don’t force things…
122
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,760
Got it.
123
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,720
Listen up. You’re hurt, Hinata.
So you follow later.
124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,390
I just said that, didn’t I?
125
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,050
Huh? Did you?
126
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,720
Right…Thanks…
127
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,680
Let’s go, Naruto!
128
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,850
I have to hurry, too…
129
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,350
I’m back!
130
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,640
You’re back, Naruto?
131
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,430
We couldn’t catch up
with them, huh…?
132
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,760
Naruto? Kiba?!
133
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,350
Was I here just now?!
134
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,720
Y-Yeah.
135
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,140
That one was an imposter!
136
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,180
Say what?!
137
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,390
But the dog didn’t notice anything…
138
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,430
He can’t be sniffed out even
with the nose of a Ninja Hound!
139
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,220
Akamaru was fooled, too!
140
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,590
We’ve got trouble!
To the Hokage, immediately.
141
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,220
Right!
142
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,760
Akamaru! You remember the smell
of that Agari old man, right?!
143
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,760
After him!
144
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,550
Lady Tsunade!
145
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,590
We’ve just received
a communication…!
146
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,010
Nobody realizes it.
147
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,640
Stay sharp.
Our mission isn’t over yet, so.
148
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,970
That’s right.
The crucial part comes now.
149
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,220
Someone’s coming!
150
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,850
We found you, imposters!
151
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,470
We’ll kick your butts!
152
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,390
Oh-ho… So you’re alive…
153
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,890
Naturally!
154
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,590
This time it’s your turn
to prepare yourselves…
155
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,850
After all, this is our home field.
156
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,590
There are times when you lose
157
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,640
even when fighting
on your home field!
158
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,680
We won’t let you get away!
159
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,890
H-Hinata?!
160
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,100
I’m going to inform the Hokage!
161
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,590
Naruto, you go after the imposters!
162
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,600
Got  …it.
163
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,970
Hey…
164
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,640
Upon careful thought,
the real Hinata hasn’t come yet…!
165
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,430
You imposter!
166
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,390
What the…?!
167
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,390
What’re you doing to Hinata?!
168
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,550
It’s just like I’m the imposter.
169
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,050
Naruto!
170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,140
What’re you doing?!
171
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,140
W-Well…
172
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,510
He’s an imposter!
173
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,010
What?!
174
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,890
Prepare yourself, imposter!
175
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,970
Hey! Wait a minute…!
176
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,680
Hey, you’re also an imposter!
177
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,260
Even if you can copy
the appearance and scent,
178
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,390
you can’t go so far as
copy Ninjutsu, right?!
179
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
Let’s go, Akamaru.
180
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,100
Fang Over…?
181
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Knocked out…?
182
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,180
No way. It was just a punch,
and I didn’t even use a Jutsu…
183
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,510
Come to think of it…
184
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,590
I was slugged good and hard,
but I didn’t feel it at all.
185
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,430
Hey! Weren’t you going
to mess up the village?!
186
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
You guys are utterly weak!
187
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,890
Damn it!
188
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,010
I’ll catch the fake Hinata,
so you handle yourself somehow!
189
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,590
Leave me to me!
190
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,590
Hold it!
191
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,850
Hold it!
192
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,390
I wonder if I got overly ambitious
and borrowed too many books…
193
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,510
Hey, Naruto!
194
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,260
You…
195
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,930
You moron!
196
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,140
You’re butt is so heavy
you fell right on it!
197
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,970
Ugly! Ugly!
198
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,590
Forehead girl!
199
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,100
I’ll kick your butt
the next time I see you!
200
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
I’ll kick your butt,
no matter what!
201
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,590
Sakura, get out of the way!
202
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,180
Naruto.
203
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,850
I’ll kick your butt!
204
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,590
Wh-Why?!
205
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,180
What?
206
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,180
Why’s the Naruto who ran that way
coming from over here?
207
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,590
I’m off on a delivery.
208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,180
Right. Take care.
209
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
What is it?! You okay, Ayame?!
210
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,590
Y-Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew in…
211
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,010
What…?
212
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,550
Na-ru-to!
213
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,100
How dare you do that
to my daughter…?!
214
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,430
Wh-What…?
215
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,180
I’m okay, Dad.
216
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,590
No, you rest a bit.
217
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,800
I will have Naruto take the responsibility
and make the delivery!
218
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,550
What?!
219
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,260
But, but I…
220
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,930
If you refuse,
221
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,010
I’ll never let you eat
my ramen ever again!
222
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,590
This isn’t the time for me
to be making a delivery!
223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,180
I finished the delivery!
224
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,430
Okay! Good work!
225
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,140
Where did he go?!
226
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,180
My…imposter!
227
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
This jerk was also weak…
228
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,590
Kiba… Stop… 					Forgive me…
229
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,680
That might’ve worked on Naruto.
But I hate soppy stuff…
230
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,590
like that!
231
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,970
Did these guys seriously
intend to attack the village…?
232
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,220
Where are you, imposter?!
233
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,590
Come out!
234
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,140
Hey!
235
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,470
Hey!
236
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,550
Could it be that I came here?
237
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,260
Yeah, you did.
238
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,890
You’ll be paying me for
what you ate earlier.
239
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,760
That jerk…!
240
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,590
Forty-five plates…
241
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,590
Here.
242
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,930
Eating and running with
someone else’s face…
243
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,590
That imposter…
244
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,800
He’s not messing up the village,
he’s messing up my reputation.
245
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,590
Hey…
246
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,430
No way…!
247
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,350
My Golden Delicious Ninja Way
Ramen Pure Heart of Fire
248
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,970
I’d been setting aside!
249
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,050
I won’t allow it…!
250
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,930
No matter what, I won’t allow it…!
251
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,680
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
252
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,930
– Go! 					– Go!
253
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,850
– Where is he?!
– Where’s the imposter?!
254
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,590
– Where are you?!
– Imposter!
255
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,590
Where are you?! Come out!
256
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,140
I’ll kill you, imposter!
257
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,590
I’ll pay the bill later!
258
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,510
– Find him! 					– Where is he?!
259
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,140
There he is!
260
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,640
Hey!
261
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,590
– I won’t let you get away!
– Got you!
262
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,720
– I’ve got you!
– You're wrong!
263
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,390
– Is it you?!
– I’m not an imposter!
264
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,050
Calm down, guys!
265
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,260
The imposter isn’t carrying
a chest on his back!
266
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,590
– What? 					– It's not him?
267
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,510
– Now that you mention it…
– That's right.
268
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,600
That’s right!
269
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Then…
270
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,970
It’s him!
271
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,590
Yikes!
272
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,590
At the end of the day,
these guys were nothing special.
273
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,680
Hey, are these guys really
Orochimaru’s henchmen?
274
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,800
Who knows?
275
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,760
The Hokage will look
into the details for us.
276
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,680
That’s right.
277
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,590
Man, I’m tired.
278
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,590
My shoulders got stiff from carrying
this thing around the whole time.
279
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,300
Naruto! Kiba!
280
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,930
Oh, the real Hinata’s come back.
281
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,760
Hey, Hinata! Over here!
282
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:14,970
Naruto!
283
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,890
He’s not carrying the chest on his back…
Then this Naruto…
284
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,300
He’s the imposter!
285
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,180
Gentle Fist!
286
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh, boy. I feel bad for that Naruto…
287
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,390
– What?! 					– What?!
288
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,100
A test?!
289
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,680
This mission was a test
290
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,430
in order to see the teamwork
of you three.
291
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,050
A Shinobi will often have to
form teams with various others
292
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,800
in response to the qualities
and conditions of the mission.
293
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,600
At such times,
294
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,680
failing if teamed with
a certain other person is a problem.
295
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,180
And so I gave you a mission
that was easy at the start.
296
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,590
And I made it so along
the way…
297
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,590
something would happen
involving a village crisis.
298
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
At that time,
299
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,510
I wanted to see whether
you could handle it as a team.
300
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,850
So that’s what it was…
301
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,470
That’s harsh!
302
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,510
We would’ve died if
we’d made the slightest mistake.
303
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,640
It’s okay. I got the story about
you guys from Lady Tsunade.
304
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,350
It was set up so even if
you were to make a mistake,
305
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,600
you would only be injured.
306
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,510
Since this time around
you had the Ninja HoundDog Akamaru,
307
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,680
I enlisted the help
of the Kedouin Clan…
308
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,590
so you wouldn’t be able
to distinguish the enemy.
309
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,220
And?
310
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,590
How did these three do?
311
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,850
Let me see…
312
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,590
They floundered part of the way
and I was worried about the outcome…
313
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,590
But I shall pass them.
314
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,550
In terms of results,
they did capture us, so…
315
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,590
Oh yeah.
316
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,680
That’s…!
317
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,100
It was more or less
our mission to bring this, so.
318
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,720
With this, our mission is complete.
319
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,010
There’s no point in going
to the trouble of bringing…
320
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,180
No, no.
321
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:25,100
There is something important inside
that I must give to you, Lady Hokage.
322
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,930
Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy.
323
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,550
You, too.
324
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,590
See ya.
325
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,390
Yeah.
326
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,350
Are they going to look
like that forever?
327
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,590
It seems they’ll get their own faces back
naturally in a few days.
328
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,510
I see…
329
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,050
Wh-What’s this…?!
330
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,590
A bill for the recent training…?!
331
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,680
Here…he said he’d be glad
to cooperate…
332
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,260
It comes to this much?
333
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
This is a hard world to live in,
isn’t it?
334
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,590
My name is Tsunade…
335
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,640
My concern now is a debt
that absolutely will not go down.
336
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,590
More like, it’s growing, isn’t it?
337
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,590
I shouldn’t have become…
the likes of Hokage…!
338
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,390
The wind blows, Ah…
339
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,140
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
340
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,640
What should be brought along?
341
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,640
Assemble them into a piece.
342
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,720
There is no second chance, never
343
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,430
How foolish it is to throw away
344
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
345
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,590
The images.
346
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,590
It probably will not end
347
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,930
It probably will not end
348
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,680
Burn that love-filled heart,
349
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,760
Sail across a thousand dreams
350
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,800
Running freely
351
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,590
To take hold of the world in hand
352
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
The clouds scatter
353
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,590
The sun sets yet again
354
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,180
The solo parade begins to move.
355
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,510
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
356
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,890
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
357
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,760
No, it’s gone, gone, gone!
Where’d you put it, Naruto?
358
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Oh, if you mean that, I wrote it.
359
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,590
You wrote it?
360
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,720
And I gave it to
a Delivery Ninja.
361
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,680
You gave it?
362
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,760
So it should reach
the other party today.
363
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,510
You idiot!
At this rate, my life as a writer will…
364
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,590
More importantly,
let’s get the training started.
365
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,970
Shut up and come with me, Naruto!
366
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,550
We have to get that back at any cost!
367
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,890
Next time: "Please, Mr. Postman!"
//%
1
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,680
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:29,590
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,890
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,050
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,220
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:52,760
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,640
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,930
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,600
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:28,590
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,590
The Leaf's Handsome Devil!
13
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,550
Blast!
14
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,590
No matter how many times you try…
15
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,050
it’s the same!
16
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,100
I’ll acknowledge you.
17
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,590
You’re not only sharp…
18
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,590
You’re also very determined…
19
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,590
In addition, I’m nice, too…
20
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,640
Striking a helpless woman
is against my policy…
21
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,470
But however I look at it,
22
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,430
you don’t have the feel of
a helpless woman…
23
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,930
in your case!
24
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,720
Don’t be getting full of yourself
25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,260
just because you released
the Genjutsu, you little clod…!
26
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,050
She’s still not completely bound.
27
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,470
Damn it…
28
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,550
I can’t lose!
29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,680
A little more…
30
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,640
What Chakra she has?!
31
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,680
Even if I bind her
at point-blank range,
32
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,590
she still pushes back…
33
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,590
But , I’ll get hammered
for sure if I let go now.
34
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,800
After all, I just have to put this
to rest with this Jutsu.
35
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,760
Hang in there, Akamaru!
36
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,720
Damn it… What’s going on?!
37
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,300
Damn it!
38
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,890
One more…to go…
39
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,300
This guy’s crazy strong…
40
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,590
Not a single hit with that
many shadow clones…
41
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,550
It’s about time…
42
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,680
I’ve been eagerly waiting.
43
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,300
Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…
The first step…
44
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,930
Sasuke…
45
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,590
Sasuke! What’re you doing
with these guys?!
46
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,720
Come on! We’re going home now!
47
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Sasuke…
48
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,600
Hey…
49
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,720
Should we go home?
50
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,970
Yeah!
51
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,350
We’ve both made it to the top!
52
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,970
I want to fight you too.
53
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,720
Hey… We’re going home.
54
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,430
Everyone’s worried about you.
55
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,590
So…
56
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,590
Sasuke!
57
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,890
Please. Bring back Sasuke…!
58
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,590
You can hear my voice, can’t you?!
59
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,590
Wait, Sasuke!
60
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,760
It’s futile…
61
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,550
Die.
62
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,010
Who’re you?
63
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,510
The rejuvenated…
64
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,260
Leaf Village’s Handsome Devil…
65
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,680
Rock Lee!
66
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,640
B-Bushy Brow…?
67
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,590
Bushy Brow, you!
What about your body…?
68
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,590
More importantly, Naruto.
Go get Sasuke.
69
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,600
But…you…
70
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,970
Please leave this person to me!
71
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,850
This guy’s…good…
72
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,720
Bushy Brow! Be careful!
He uses his own bones to attack.
73
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,010
Bones…you say…?
74
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,680
He’s crazy strong…
75
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,510
What’re you doing?!
Please go, quickly!
76
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,390
Naruto…
77
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,590
You also promised Sakura
with a “nice-guy pose,” right?!
78
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,590
I’ll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!
79
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,010
It’s a promise of a lifetime!
80
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,890
This person…I’ll beat him!
81
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,050
I promise!
82
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,430
Right!
83
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,720
I won’t let you!
84
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,590
Die.
85
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,180
Please don’t ignore me!
86
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,590
Oh…
87
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
Bushy Brow…
88
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
You don’t have the time
to be inattentive!
89
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,590
Good response!
90
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,600
However…
91
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,720
If Sasuke is inside that coffin…
92
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,600
It’d be totally impossible to take them
on with a Genin team…
93
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,800
We Jonin are in this plight….
94
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,590
We should organize a special team
and send them out for backup.
95
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,390
We can’t do that…
96
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,510
Ever since Orochimaru’s attack,
97
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,430
the Leaf is currently losing strength
as a great land.
98
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,800
You understand that the Jonin
and Chunin are being totally mobilized
99
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,390
in order to take out possible domestic
and international dangers.
100
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Even if the Sharingan were to fall
into Orochimaru’s hands…
101
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,600
We should now prioritize
avoiding war with other lands.
102
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,350
But… I’m sure the Orochimaru situation
isn’t a problem that can be deferred forever.
103
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,680
If he regains power…
He’ll promptly attack again…
104
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
I know…
105
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,260
I’m not such a fool.
106
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,350
I was sure to think about it and
measures have already been taken.
107
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,600
In here!
108
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,220
What’s wrong, Guy?
You’re on the brink of exhaustion.
109
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,140
Did something happen
on your mission?
110
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,590
No… I took care of the mission
and ran back with all of my might…
111
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
More importantly…
112
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,590
Lee! What happened with
Lee’s surgery?!
113
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,590
It was a success.
114
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,100
He can start training starting tomorrow
if it’s just for Jutsu.
115
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,890
Well, bed rest for a while
would be best though.
116
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,590
Th-There’s trouble, Lady Fifth Hokage.
117
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,930
Rock Lee is gone!
118
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,930
No!
119
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,930
Next will be the end.
120
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,970
Damn it… Last night while
I treated Genma and Raido?
121
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,590
Lee…
122
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,260
That fool… He went after them.
123
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,510
And…he must’ve been really flustered…
124
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,430
He took my bottle of sake for
a bottle of medicine by mistake….
125
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,680
SAKE
126
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,590
Sake?!
127
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,510
Uh…Uh-oh…
128
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,720
What’s wrong, Guy?
129
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,930
Actually, when Lee drinks even
a little bit of alcohol…
130
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,010
Things get…so messy…
131
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,470
Get so messy?
132
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,590
Severe Leaf Hurricane!
133
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,390
He’s agile… My kicks don’t hit.
134
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,260
You’re flexible to
a surprising extent…
135
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,890
And you make unique movements, eh?
136
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,850
You’re too…straight forward.
137
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,590
It’s over…
138
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,550
Please wait!
139
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,970
I’m sorry.
lt’s about time for my medicine!
140
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,050
I have to be sure to drink it, so…
141
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,260
Excuse me a moment.
142
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,050
I’ve always disliked medicine.
143
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,010
It…happened before when
I took him to a restaurant
144
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,470
to celebrate his acquisition
of the “Hidden Lotus.”
145
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,970
Lee mistook my sake for water…
146
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,890
As soon as he drank just
a small cup…
147
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,680
of the sake, things got ugly…
148
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,300
Got ugly…?
149
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,300
After a silence that was like
right before a storm…
150
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,760
The moment I realized it,
151
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,600
the restaurant…
152
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,640
had gotten all messed up…
153
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,930
Medicine always tastes stran…
154
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,010
What…? What did this guy drink?
155
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,010
Messed up?
What do you mean?
156
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,220
He’s terribly….!
157
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,760
Lady Tsunade… Lee goes into
158
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,590
an incredible drunken frenzy!
159
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,350
Huh…?
160
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,590
Who the heck are you?! Hey!
161
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,930
Geez, who are you anyway?
162
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,010
Acting cool… So irritating…
163
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,590
Hence, he’s a natural user of…
164
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,640
Drunken Fist!
165
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,010
Sasuke!
166
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,930
For the first time, I spoke to you
167
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,050
And you smiled
168
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,590
For the first time, I was able to speak
169
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,470
In my own words
170
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:41,010
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
171
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,590
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
172
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,260
My clumsy attempts with words
173
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,930
You listened without turning away
174
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,220
No wonder I get carried away by you
175
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:11,300
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
176
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,550
I feel so sad
177
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,510
But…
178
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,640
For the first time, I spoke to you
179
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,970
And you smiled
180
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,470
For the first time, I was able to speak
181
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,640
In my own words
182
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,010
For the first time, I spoke to you
183
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,510
And you smiled
184
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,760
For the first time, I was able to speak
185
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,760
In my own words
186
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,590
For the first time, I spoke to you
187
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,590
You fell for it, didn’t you?!
188
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,350
How about my strategy?
189
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,350
This is the Shinobi Secret
of reading the double bluff!
190
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,590
Guy Sensei! I did it once again!
Yeah!
191
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,260
But, what’s this?!
The world is oddly…
192
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,600
f-floating,
and I’ve no inclination of losing!
193
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,100
Next episode: “The Beast Within.”
//%
1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,680
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,100
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,760
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,260
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,890
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,350
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,180
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,930
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,470
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,590
A Town of Outlaws!
The Shadow of the Fuma Clan
21
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,970
It seems that the most bustling traveler’s
town in the Land of Rice Paddies
22
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,590
is at the bottom of these mountains.
23
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,970
You’re going to weird places again
24
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,550
in the name of investigation,
aren’t you, Pervy Sage?!
25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,470
Please stop it already!
26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,590
We had a rough time shaking
off the bodyguards from the rip-off bar.
27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,590
I understand your point,
28
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,550
but there’s no other way to find
Village Hidden in the Sound.
29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,510
Gee, I don’t like it either, but…
30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,590
This is truly a problem…
31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,590
But we have to do things
we don’t like… Right?!
32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,590
Okay, let’s go!
33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,430
Naruto, Sakura,
don’t drag your feet!
34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,930
Investigation, investigation!
What a pain.
35
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,590
He looks like he’s having fun.
36
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,140
He hasn’t learned at all.
37
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,590
Fuma Alley
38
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,590
– Oww! 					– That's my line!
39
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,760
This is even rougher than
the traveler’s town before.
40
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,550
Let’s just take a pass on this place
and find Village Hidden in the Sound.
41
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,590
Say…
42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,720
I don’t have any more money.
43
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,260
I don’t have any more money either!
44
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,390
Here!
45
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,760
You guys go get some food with that
46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,930
and wait in the temple
on the outskirts of town.
47
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,930
Information accumulates
in this kind of place,
48
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,550
but it’s not good for you guys to see.
49
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,760
I’ll sacrifice myself and check it out.
50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,510
He’s a surprisingly nice person…
51
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,800
Sakura… You’re still so naïve.
52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,010
Where should I investigate first?
53
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,590
Gee, how rough…
lnvestigations are painful.
54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,800
Let’s leave the Pervy Sage be
and check somewhere else.
55
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,390
What’s the matter, Sakura?
56
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,010
I don’t think…
Sasuke’s in this land anymore.
57
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,180
What’s the matter?!
58
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,010
We won’t know that if
we don’t investigate!
59
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,350
Yeah, but…
60
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,890
Our opponent is Orochimaru.
61
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,720
Of course, things might not go easily.
62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,890
But you know…
63
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,260
But I’m sure we’ll find him!
64
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,890
Right.
65
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,930
Naruto!
66
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,180
You’re…the one from before?!
67
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,590
This kid’s…hurt…
68
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,220
You…?
69
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,970
Naruto!
70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,510
Substitution, huh…?
71
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,850
We let them get away.
72
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,510
Don’t worry…
73
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,590
My cute children
are making a silver trail for us.
74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,470
They can’t escape from us now…
75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,180
It seems those two are
petty Ninja from somewhere.
76
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,180
But getting involved with us
has sealed their fate.
77
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,590
It’s unfortunate for them…
78
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,100
The objective of those who sneak into
this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.
79
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,140
Sure enough, the skin of
a young woman is supple.
80
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,300
You’re mean!
81
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,300
Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.
82
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,140
By the way, have you guys heard
rumors about the Sound Village?
83
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,590
The Sound Village?
84
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,590
I’ve never heard the name
of such a village.
85
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,470
I’ll tip you handsomely if you tell me.
86
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,010
But I really don’t know.
87
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,800
I’ve never heard of it.
88
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,350
I’ve heard of it!
89
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,590
One of my regulars knows
a lot about it.
90
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,140
Wanna come?
91
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,590
Yeah.
92
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,550
His home is in the back of this alley.
93
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,390
Trapped like a rat.
94
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,800
What, it’s a seedy old man!
Hey! He’s got money, right?
95
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,680
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
96
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,050
You punks! Stop the idle chatter
and take care of him now!
97
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,590
Right, boss!
98
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,600
Getting infatuated with girls has sealed
your fate! Rest in peace!
99
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,850
Ninja Art: 					Needle Jizo.
100
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,890
You punk…
101
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,050
I’m in a hurry…
102
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,010
I think it’d be best if you
answer compliantly
103
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,510
whether or not you know
about Hidden Sound Village.
104
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,590
You’re a fool if I look like
a compliant person to you!
105
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,890
You a Ninja?
106
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,430
If so?
107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,590
Interesting!
108
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,140
We’ve reduced ourselves to
being thieves,
109
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,590
but we’re a somewhat
famous Shinobi clan around here!
110
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,970
Instead of taking your life,
I could hire you if you want!
111
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,590
A Ninja, huh…
112
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,590
Then I don’t need to go easy on you.
113
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,300
Don’t be acting like a big shot, old man!
114
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Shut up, you squirt!
115
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,550
A Ninja refers to one who endures.
116
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,590
Those who couldn’t endure
their hunger pangs
117
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,470
and resort to use their diligently
studied Jutsu for stealing
118
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,590
are not called Ninja!
119
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,600
I won’t let that pass!
120
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,930
Thinking we’re fellow Shinobi,
we took pity on you.
121
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,640
Acting all conceited!
122
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,300
Regret after being sliced in two!
123
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,850
Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato!
124
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,220
Rasengan!
125
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,890
You punk! How dare you
do that to the boss!
126
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,390
We won’t let you do
any more than that!
127
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,220
Oh?
128
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,430
Hold it, you guys!
129
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,350
I didn’t know you were so good!
130
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,890
That Jutsu just now…
131
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,300
I sense you must be
a person of stature!
132
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,930
If it’s all right,
may I ask you your name?
133
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,590
If you don’t know, then I shall tell you!
134
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,970
Women become infatuated
with his sex appeal.
135
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,590
He’s strong against Shinobi,
but has a soft spot for women!
136
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,220
He exists in Village Hidden in the Leaves…
137
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,050
And made his name known…
138
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,550
Master Jiraiya, that’s me!
139
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,590
What?!
140
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,510
You guys bow your heads
and beg for your lives!
141
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,680
We’ll all be killed!
142
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,100
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
143
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,180
Although we didn’t know,
being so rude to Master Jiraiya,
144
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,680
reputed as one of the Legendary
Sannin of the Leaf Village!
145
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,590
We beg for your forgiveness!
146
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,470
So my name’s known in this land, too…
147
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,350
Well, it’s okay.
148
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,590
So is it true that you know about
Village Hidden in the Sound?
149
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,720
Yes! There were many Ninja clans
in the Land of Rice Paddies,
150
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,970
including us Fuma.
151
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,890
We divided up the roles
amongst ourselves
152
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,890
and the Ninja of this land
were doing well in their own way.
153
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,590
Until that man appeared…
154
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,010
Who was that man?
155
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,590
It’s regrettable to even speak
of that name…
156
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,550
It was Orochimaru!
157
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,590
It’s okay! Rest easy!
158
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,470
If germs get into the wound
and you get tetanus,
159
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,590
you won’t be saved.
160
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,640
But fortunately, I have medicine,
so let me treat you.
161
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,760
They’re not coming.
162
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,800
Just show us your wound.
163
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,050
Well, huh?
164
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,600
Naruto, go wait outside
till my treatment is done.
164.01	01:37:53:04	01:37:53:24	Huh?
165
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,600
Why do I have to be
the only one chased out?!
166
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,760
Jeez!
167
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,350
I guess it can’t be helped.
168
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,140
Don’t peek!
169
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,640
I know.
170
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,970
Okay, show me your wound.
171
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,390
How mean…
172
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,590
To hit me out of the blue…?
173
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,930
Whoa, interesting.
174
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,590
Naruto! You can come in!
175
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,590
What?!
176
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,890
A cute girl?
177
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,680
Sakura! This girl!
Who the heck is this girl?!
178
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,930
How dense. It’s the Ninja
from a moment ago.
179
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,470
Come to think of it…
180
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,470
Why…?
181
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,720
I am Sasame Fuma.
182
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,300
Sasame… Why were you being
chased by those guys?
183
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,430
If you like, try talking about it.
184
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,800
We might be able to help.
185
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,220
They were the Sound Ninja protecting
Orochimaru’s residence.
186
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,390
What?!
187
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,140
I’m sorry for mistaking you guys as
one of them the other day.
188
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,760
That doesn’t matter!
189
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,590
We’re also looking for Orochimaru!
190
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,300
Would you please give us the details?
191
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,760
Okay…
192
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,600
It all started with the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Rice Paddies
193
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,850
launching an attack on
a neighboring land
194
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,430
in an attempt to expand the territory.
195
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,430
The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land…
196
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,220
And there aren’t that many Shinobi.
197
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,600
It was a foolhardy attack.
Losing was expected…
198
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,590
And the Shinobi clans of this land
199
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,930
who participated in
the losing battle went to ruin…
200
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,590
We the Fuma Clan as well.
201
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,180
I hear that among
the surviving Shinobi,
202
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,510
there are those who have left the land
203
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,930
and those who have
stooped to become thieves.
204
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,720
Even so, we’ve lived believing
in a restoration of the clan
205
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,010
and continued to live hiding
in the shadows.
206
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,970
At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden
in the Sound appeared before us
207
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,590
attempting to create the first full-scale
Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.
208
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,600
The emissary of
the Sound Village said…
209
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,050
My master Orochimaru is
gathering all sorts of Jutsu!
210
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,510
He has taken an interest
in your Jutsu well.
211
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,680
Depending on your work,
212
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,010
you might be given the chance
to serve the Feudal Lord!
213
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,140
My cousin Arashi…
214
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,510
was an up-and-coming star
for the restoration of the clan…
215
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,600
Arashi as a representative of the clan
216
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,640
headed for Village Hidden in
the Sound together with the emissary.
217
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,970
But…
218
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,220
And then…?
219
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,590
We waited for a notice from Arashi, but…
220
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,140
There is no word from him, huh?
221
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,300
Damn it!
He was tricked by that Orochimaru!
222
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,180
Naruto!
223
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,050
Oh…!
224
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,300
Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi
might be safe…
225
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,350
We don’t know, right?
And so…and so…
226
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,220
Idiot…!
227
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,720
I’m going to save Arashi!
228
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,180
I have a small body and
my power is weak.
229
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,720
So no matter what I did…
230
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,590
I did nothing but become a hindrance
even in Ninjutsu training…
231
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,430
But Arashi always saved me!
232
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Everyone in the village has
already given up, but…
233
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,590
So I’ll find Village Hidden
in the Sound alone…
234
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,100
And so you were chased by
the Sound Ninja, right?
235
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,760
This time, it’s my turn to save Arashi!
236
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,640
Sasame!
237
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,220
I…I want to be of help to Arashi!
238
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,890
Naruto!
239
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,220
Yeah…I know!
240
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,470
We have to go to Village of the Sound
to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!
241
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,680
Now instead of one,
242
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,050
it’s just that there are two guys
for us to bring back.
243
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,970
I’ll save your cousin, Sasame!
244
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,430
Right!
245
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,050
Eew! A spider…
246
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,590
What’s this?!
247
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,600
Naruto!
248
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,800
Wha--! What’s this?!
249
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,590
Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!
250
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,930
My cute children made a path
for me out of silver thread
251
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,640
and told me where you guys
were going.
252
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,220
All three of you together will descend
into hell while bearing the secret!
253
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,850
Naruto! It’s the Ventriloquism Jutsu!
254
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,260
He’s scattering his voice
to multiple directions
255
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,350
and covering up location and number!
256
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,550
I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!
257
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,720
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
258
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,550
Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!
259
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,390
It’s a large number,
but it’s just Clone Jutsu.
260
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,260
No. Look closely, Jigumo!
261
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,590
The threads are getting tangled.
262
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,850
All of the clones are tangible?!
Shadow clones?!
263
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,140
If so… Kagero!
264
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,760
Understood…
265
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,850
Come out!
266
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,390
Borne to be born, lived to live,
one sunrise and one sunset…
267
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,350
The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.
268
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,430
Thinking that such a fleeting life
is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable…
269
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,350
Know that I’m at my best
270
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,140
when living in the dark and
deep in the ground!
271
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,350
Ninja Art:
272
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,590
Ant Lion Jutsu!
273
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,350
When I recalled the parts one by one,
274
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:34,590
I felt as though
I had understood everything
275
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:45,260
Faded words which I kept so close to me
276
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:54,970
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
277
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,720
and this distant yearning for you
278
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:11,100
I live, simply repeating this cycle
279
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:22,720
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
280
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:33,260
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
281
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,930
I’ll keep these thoughts…
282
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,800
Darn it! What a pesky bunch!
283
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,800
But I won’t be done in so easily!
284
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,550
I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt
285
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,970
and bring back Sasuke and
Sasame’s cousin!
286
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,140
It doesn’t matter if you guys
are powerhouses!
287
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,590
I’ll kick all of your butts,
so bring it on from anywhere!
288
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,180
Next episode, “Pure Betrayal,
and a Fleeting Plea!”
//%
1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,540
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,290
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,990
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,580
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,080
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,990
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:55,410
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:06,200
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:15,790
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,950
What were you gazing at?
11
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,080
What is it?
12
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,870
Who are you?!
13
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,580
It was you…?
You killed him, didn’t you?
14
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,000
N-No… I don’t know anything…!
15
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,620
The Cursed Warrior…?
16
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,160
The Cursed Warrior
17
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Old man’s…snot!
18
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,500
I just can’t get myself into
training doing it alone…
19
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,000
I wonder if we won’t get a mission
connected to Sasuke or something.
20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,870
The Land of Birds?
From such a remote land…
21
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,120
That’s what’s troubling us.
22
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,250
The “Cursed Warrior” apparition has been
disturbing the castle town
23
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,040
and misleading the public, huh?
24
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,790
So they want us to exterminate a ghost?
25
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,160
I declined once saying
we can’t go so far
26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,950
as to accept the extermination
of a ghost, but…
27
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,120
I must have you accept this at any cost.
Please accept!
28
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,580
Is it because the money isn’t enough?
29
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,120
We in the Land of Birds are
experiencing financial difficulties.
30
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,870
Even this is the very limit
the budget will allow…
31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,870
It’s not an issue of money.
32
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,040
In other words,
it’s the mission details.
33
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,990
Be that as it may,
34
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,990
indeed there isn’t even enough to
cover travel expenses with this amount…
35
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,990
Now that things have come
to this pass…
36
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,500
I shall commit harakiri…!
37
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,990
Don’t be hasty!
38
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,580
Yikes!
39
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,700
It’s the little bit of pocket money
I have saved up.
40
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,990
I’ll pay out of my own pocket.
So with this, please…!
41
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,540
And that’s why you accepted it?
42
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,040
It’s indulgent even for me…
43
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,660
Nonetheless, most of the
Jonin and Chunin are out on missions.
44
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,120
I was thinking of how to handle this…
45
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,620
I guess someone’s talking about you.
46
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,620
Everyone’s busy with missions,
so they don’t have time for such things.
47
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,750
Who’s that guy…?
48
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,120
He’s been like that since earlier.
49
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,000
Even tasty ramen won’t go down the throat
right being watched like that!
50
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,000
Come inside and eat if you’re hungry!
51
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,040
No, I’m not hungry…
52
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,990
So? Tasty, huh?
53
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,990
Yes!
54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,330
Thanks for your business.
55
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,370
Come back and have Naruto
treat you again…
56
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,540
Again and again like that?
Give me a break.
57
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,500
Thank you for treating me.
ln appreciation…
58
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,540
N-No, you don’t need to worry about it…
59
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,990
But hey, what’s your name?
60
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,830
You’re not a familiar face
from this village…
61
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,700
Yes, my name is Chishima and
I have come from the Land of Birds.
62
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,950
I came to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves to commission a mission…
63
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,290
You’re flat broke even though
you came as a messenger of your land?
64
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,990
There wasn’t enough money
for the commission,
65
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,950
so I even used up
my own pocket money…
66
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,450
Then it must be
a very important mission, huh?
67
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,450
It might even cost an important friend
of mine’s very life…
68
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,250
Your friend…?
What the heck do you mean?
69
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,660
Ever since I was little,
70
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,160
I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi,
the feudal lord of the Land of Birds…
71
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,540
You’re friends with a feudal lord?!
72
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,000
I said feudal lord,
73
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,910
but he was only just appointed last year
and actually he’s the same age as me.
74
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,200
No kidding?
Then he’s a totally young feudal lord.
75
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,540
Y-Yes… The previous feudal lord,
his father Lord Owashi died from illness
76
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,250
and after that he even lost his twin sister…
77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,290
Ever since then,
78
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,750
Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful,
has become a totally different person…
79
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,160
He wouldn’t show his face
even if I visited…
80
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,200
I’m worried about him as
a friend rather than a feudal lord.
81
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,620
I was thinking something might
have happened to him…
82
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,120
So if there is something
I can do,
83
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,080
I want to do whatever I can,
as a friend…
84
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,990
I couldn’t…save Sasuke.
But this guy’s still…
85
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,120
Leave it to me.
86
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,040
What?
87
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,450
Let’s save your friend!
88
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,250
Right!
89
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,990
Old Lady Tsunade! You’re mean!
90
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,750
Listen, you could at least knock
when entering my office.
91
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,250
More importantly! What do you mean
by fleecing bro of his pocket money
92
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,450
and then not accepting the mission?!
93
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,450
Huh?
94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,750
People call stuff like that devilish!
You old lady devil!
95
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,160
Try saying that again!
96
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,790
I’m sorry!
97
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,120
I wonder if Naruto…is okay…
98
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,450
He’ll be fine.
99
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,990
You’ve gotten to know a good guy…
100
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,200
He may not look it,
but he’s quite dependable.
101
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,580
What?!
102
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,750
R-Right…
103
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,870
Who said I wouldn’t accept the mission?
104
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,950
Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Neji
to finish his mission and come back.
105
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,540
Half-cocked jerk.
106
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,620
Lee is on a mission with Guy.
107
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,500
You and Tenten will form a three-man team
with Neji as the leader, got it?
108
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,580
Then did you hear from that kid
about the mission details?
109
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,200
Well actually, not yet…
110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,540
It’s the extermination of a ghost.
111
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,370
A ghost?
112
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,750
It seems that it appears when
you’re walking through town at night…
113
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,290
A ghost clad in white armor.
114
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,450
That’s what you’ll…
115
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,990
I-I didn’t hear anything about a ghost…
116
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,160
Are you scared of it?
117
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,540
I’m not scared. I couldn’t be a Ninja
if I got scared at stuff like that!
118
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,700
But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts?
119
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,410
Who knows…?
120
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,540
Try testing it out yourself.
121
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,330
Jeez, why didn’t you say at the start
122
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,000
that it was a commission
to exterminate a ghost?!
123
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn’t tell you?
124
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,990
Not even a word.
But that’s just a rumor anyway, right?
125
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,990
I haven’t seen it, but…
126
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,990
See?
127
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,990
But it seems my master,
Lord Moso, saw it close up.
128
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,000
F-For real?!
129
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,250
The Land of Birds, huh…?
That’s sure far…
130
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,700
Village Hidden in the Leaves
131
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,620
Land of Birds
132
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,990
Umm, is there more…?
133
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,990
You sure eat a lot considering
you’re thin.
134
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,990
I’m sorry. I’m often called
a skinny voracious eater.
135
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,830
Hey, by the way, is there really such
a thing as the Cursed Warrior?
136
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,580
There are people who say
137
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,000
it’s the disembodied spirit of
the previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi.
138
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,250
The disembodied spirit of
a dead feudal lord…
139
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,990
Rather than ghosts,
140
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,040
tell us a little more about
the Land of Birds.
141
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,990
Sure…
142
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,620
The capitol of the Land of Birds
stretches across the banks of the lake
143
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,120
where migratory birds rest…
144
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,950
It was a peaceful town with
lots of green
145
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,290
and where water from the lake would
be drawn into the canals…
146
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,870
However, after the sudden death of
the previous feudal lord,
147
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,330
there was much uproar.
148
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,990
His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei,
the tactician from previously,
149
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,580
were nominated to be
the next feudal lord…
150
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,500
But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagi
was still too young
151
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,120
and was vehemently opposed
to him assuming the feudal lordship.
152
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,500
But in the end, Lord Sagi
took the seat of feudal lord
153
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,990
and the matter was closed
with Moso the high priest
154
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,000
providing tutelage as
a superintendent official…
155
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,250
However, before even half
a year passed,
156
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,040
Lady Toki, his twin sister,
died suddenly…
157
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,990
After that, Lord Sagi
who was so cheerful
158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,990
turned into a totally different person,
became coldhearted
159
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,990
and he now conducts governmental
matters confined in his mansion…
160
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,750
From about that time,
161
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,040
the “Cursed Warrior” began appearing
in the castle town…
162
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,950
Those in the castle town say
that Lord Owashi was killed by someone…
163
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,040
There are even those who say
that the Cursed Warrior
164
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,700
is the ghost of Lord Owashi
searching for the person
165
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,620
who drove him to death and is attempting
to have his revenge…
166
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,990
That’s scary…
167
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,660
There’s no such thing as ghosts.
168
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,410
But…
169
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,080
That priest Moso is the one
170
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,990
who gained the most
from Owashi’s death, huh…?
171
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,620
Lord Moso is a magnificent person
of virtue with no self-interests!
172
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,290
Then the suspicious one is…
173
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,330
The only one left is Komei the tactician!
174
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,870
I bet he assassinated Owashi
175
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,660
in an attempt to become
the feudal lord, but failed!
176
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,200
He has complained whenever
opportunity offered itself,
177
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,990
after Lord Sagi became
the feudal lord as well!
178
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,990
A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagi
by starting the rumor
179
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,500
about the Cursed Warrior might be
a piece of cake for Lord Komei…!
180
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,450
All right! There’s no doubt.
181
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,160
It’s settled. The true identity of
the Cursed Warrior is Komei!
182
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,370
The true identity of the ghost
is revealed, huh…?
183
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,990
Lord Komei, there was nothing unusual
on the scheduled patrol.
184
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,990
You may step down…
185
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,990
Yes, sire.
186
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,990
Aren’t we at our destination yet?!
187
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,700
Just a little further until
Lord Moso’s residence.
188
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,790
Where is he?! This way?
189
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Where did he go?!
190
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,990
Th-There he is!
191
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,120
Get him! Drag him down!
192
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,870
Cursed Warrior!
193
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,620
He vanished.
194
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,990
Lord Komei! Are you all right?!
195
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,830
I’m fine. Don’t panic!
196
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,910
What’s that?!
197
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,120
It’s flying?!
198
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,080
Clad in white armor,
possesses a halberd,
199
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,620
and wears a mask with
a frightening look…
200
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,990
There’s no doubt…
lt’s the Cursed Warrior!
201
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,080
After him!
202
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Are you going to ride on
my shoulders forever?
203
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,700
Wait here! I’ll pin down
the true identity of the ghost!
204
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,500
Huh? R-Right…
205
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,540
Where’d he go?!
206
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,540
Over there!
207
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,200
Byakugan!
208
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,370
I can’t see him…
209
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,330
What does that mean?!
210
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,370
There’s no human presence in here…
211
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,330
At least, a living presence…
212
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,990
Wh-Why do you put it that way…?
213
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,990
Shh! Didn’t you hear
something just now?
214
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,040
I thought you didn’t feel
a human presence!
215
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,910
I told you…living presence.
216
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,160
Wh-What do you want?!
217
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,990
Damn it, damn it.
218
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,620
You little!
219
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,580
Chain Weight!
220
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,330
Th-There can’t be something like ghosts.
No such things as ghosts!
221
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,990
Stop, Naruto! He’s…!
222
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,080
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
223
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:24,990
U!
224
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,700
Zu!
225
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,330
Ma!
226
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,990
Ki!
227
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,160
Naruto Barrage!
228
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,200
Yes!  Now I’ll verify the true identity!
229
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,990
This is…
230
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,990
The insides are empty.
231
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,330
That means…
232
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,990
it’s a real ghost!
233
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:40,990
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
234
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:52,660
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
235
00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:03,990
What dreams did you chase to get here?
236
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:16,080
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
237
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:27,620
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
238
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:39,040
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
239
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,990
I’ll be close to you
240
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,910
So that’s Sagi,
the feudal lord of this land, huh?
241
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,160
He’s far away,
but he might be quite cool.
242
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,580
Shh, be quiet!
243
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,990
What is it, Neji?
244
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,990
Something’s strange.
What’s with this blood thirst?
245
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,990
What? Bloodthirsty?
Could it be assassins?
246
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,120
They might be Shinobi.
ls everyone ready?!
247
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,040
– Yeah. 					– Yeah.
248
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,830
I’ll protect the feudal lord!
249
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,870
Next: “The Tactician’s Intent.”
//%
1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,590
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,550
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,590
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,970
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,510
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,140
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,590
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,180
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,720
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,760
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,390
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,640
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,850
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:19,600
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,470
The Powerful Helper
16
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,470
Old Man Genno…
17
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,300
Yes! This is quite good!
18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,550
Isn't it?!
19
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,550
Why’d he do something like this?
20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,010
Now this detonator won’t activate.
21
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,800
Excellent, Tenten.
22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,600
Now we can sigh with relief.
23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,640
No, it’s still too soon to be relieved.
24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,590
Right… When Genno realizes that
25
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,590
the detonator here has been removed…
26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,600
he might activate
the Paper Bombs with
27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
some other method and blow up the Leaf.
28
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,590
Oh, right.
29
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,850
You jerk. Don’t scare me like that, Choji!
30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,260
Sorry.
31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,760
At the moment,
it seems there’s no one here
32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,510
who’s picked up on our movements.
33
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,390
All right, then put things back
the way they were.
34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,590
Got it.
35
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,140
Now then…
36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,680
You guys do the Kunai Knife practice
like before.
37
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,600
Don’t hit the center.
38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,010
We know.
39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,300
But we were sure lucky…
Nobody hit the center.
40
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,680
But I hit it right in the center yesterday.
41
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,800
I bet you were off by a little.
42
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,720
What? I don’t know about that..
43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,300
It hit, I tell you.
44
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,510
To think there’d be this many.
45
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,430
Lady Tsunade, let’s evacuate
the villagers as quickly as possible.
46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,760
Hey, you’re joking, right?
47
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,430
What do you mean?
48
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,590
If you do that, Genno might…
49
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,220
blow up the remaining Paper Bombs
50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,390
right under the cover
of the evacuation confusion.
51
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,220
I see.
52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,100
Naruto and the others are removing
the Paper Bombs now.
53
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,760
Could you wait for their report?
54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,590
Akamaru?
55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,100
Did you find one?
56
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,590
There it is!
57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,590
All right!
58
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,300
Attaboy, Akamaru.
59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,800
How’s it coming?
60
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,050
Just a little more.
61
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,800
Yes!
62
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,590
I leave the rest to you.
63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Leave it to me.
64
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,680
Did you get it yet, Naruto?
65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,390
Just a little more.
66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,800
Just a little more, I tell you.
67
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,050
H-Hang in there, Naruto.
68
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,140
Damn it, you little…
69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,390
Hey, what’re you guys doing?
70
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, umm…
71
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,590
Some money got into the opening.
72
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,220
Oh, I’ll get it out for you later.
73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,220
No, no. That’d be dangerous…
74
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,100
I mean, there’s no time to waste with
eating ramen.
75
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,590
Th-That’s right.
76
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,800
Ichiraku is sure tasty, isn’t it?
Well, hang in there.
77
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,640
Yeah, thank you.
78
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,590
Thanks.
79
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,680
Phew, we got through it well.
80
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,350
Excellent, Naruto.
81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,390
We’d like more manpower.
82
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,590
It takes too long just with us.
83
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,800
But there aren’t any other Shinobi
left in the village.
84
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,760
Well, there are some here, though.
85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,260
People of leisure who do nothing
but tell about old stories and
86
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,800
complain about
what the young people do.
87
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,140
Huh?
88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,600
Could they be…?
89
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,590
Did you get that foul mouth from
the Third Hokage?
90
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,470
It’s the job of us advisors to
give advice to the youngsters.
91
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,180
What’s wrong with complaining?
92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,720
It seems you have a good nose for
village crises due to your longevity.
93
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,590
You’re plenty older than
you look yourself.
94
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,300
Wh-What did you say? You old bag!
95
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,180
Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage.
96
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,590
We’ve grasped most of the situation.
Where should we head to?
97
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,640
Then there’s a place
I’ve been saving for you.
98
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,260
Oh ho. I can’t wait.
99
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,350
To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten.
100
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,010
That’s a powerful supporter.
101
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,390
Wow.
102
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,590
But scary.
103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,180
Hurry! Youth, full power!
104
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,350
The enemy’s in the Leaf!
105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,800
I appreciate it,
but I can’t stand those two.
106
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,590
But the removal operation
will proceed swiftly
107
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,640
once Guy Senpai and the others who
headed for the Hidden Waterfall get back.
108
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,590
It’ll be nice if things were to
go conveniently like that, but…
109
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,970
Shikamaru, have you got something?
110
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,140
I mean, it’s not ordinary stuff.
111
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,180
When and how the hell
did he set them?
112
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,760
There are too many Paper Bombs.
An abnormal amount of it.
113
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,050
No doubt about it.
114
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,970
Uh-huh.
115
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,300
And there’s one more thing
bugging me.
116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,590
We’re overlooking something huge…
I really get that feeling.
117
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
Almost.
118
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,010
What’re you doing?
You’re not supposed to hit the center.
119
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,680
That’s right.
120
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,590
I’m next. I’ll miss.
121
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,180
In your case,
you’ll probably miss even if you aim.
122
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,180
How’s it going, Neji?
123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,760
The Paper Bomb removal operation
is going smoothly.
124
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,590
I don’t see anyone
resembling Genno either.
125
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,180
I wonder where the enemy is.
126
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,100
Making us walk all the way to
the outskirts of town.
127
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,680
She must’ve gotten this slave driver
tendency from the Third Hokage.
128
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,970
A place that wouldn’t be unusual
for old people to tell old stories.
129
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,220
I’ll rake her over the coals
when we get back.
130
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,350
But what is that Genno fellow thinking?
131
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,930
There’s no point to setting
Paper Bombs in a place like this.
132
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,470
Is that what you really think?
133
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,510
What?
134
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,260
There was a plan to build
135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,800
a shopping district
around here before, right?
136
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,930
That talk was over thirty years ago.
137
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,590
Hmm?!
138
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,930
What’s this?
139
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,590
H-Hey, isn’t that…?
140
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,850
Yes.
141
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,800
Look at this.
142
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,800
What is it?
143
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,550
The Jutsu form written here is different.
144
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
You’re right.
145
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,550
Now that you mention it, there’s no doubt.
146
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,100
It looks the same to me, though.
147
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,100
Where are your eyes pointing?
148
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,350
It’s the first time I’ve seen this.
149
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,590
It’s nothing new to us.
150
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,510
Speaking of Paper Bombs,
that’s what they were in the old days.
151
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,100
Then this is an old version?
152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,260
It seems most of the Paper Bombs
153
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
that have been set in
the village are of that type.
154
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,720
Everyone, please look closely once more
155
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,300
at the locations where
the Paper Bombs were set.
156
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,550
Although this is
a residential area here,
157
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,760
there are hardly any Paper Bombs set.
158
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,890
On the other hand,
a large number of Paper Bombs
159
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,010
have been set in places
where hardly anyone lives.
160
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,890
What does that mean?
161
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,140
In the old plans,
162
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,590
that was supposed to become
a bustling shopping district.
163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
What? Could that be…?
164
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,140
If you think about it putting together
various factors
165
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,470
such as the antique Paper Bombs,
166
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,890
the places where they were set
and such…
167
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,970
This is a trap that was
set thirty years ago.
168
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,220
Thirty years ago…
169
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,930
It’s just ridiculous.
Not one person noticed in thirty years.
170
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,590
It’s a blind spot.
171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,430
Nobody would ever think
172
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,550
that this many Paper Bombs would
be set here in this village.
173
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,010
Once buried in a wall,
174
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,350
it couldn’t be found unless Byakugan
or something was used.
175
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,510
Then you mean
the Genno guy tried to use
176
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,640
the Paper Bombs someone
set thirty years ago?
177
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,140
But how did he find them?
178
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,590
Thirty years ago?
Could it be…?!
179
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,590
Shikamaru, where are you going?
180
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,220
Hey! Wait up.
181
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,010
We’re finished here, too
182
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,590
Let’s go to the next spot, Hinata.
183
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,590
Right.
184
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,050
Hinata!
185
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,350
What’s the matter?
186
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,590
I was using the Byakugan the whole time,
187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,890
so I’m just a little tired…
I’m fine.
188
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,930
Are you sure?
189
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,760
Let me see.
190
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,590
Oh.
191
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,430
You’re kind of feverish.
Your face is red, too.
192
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,550
No, it’s not like that.
193
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,590
I’ll be okay if I just rest a little…
194
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,140
Really? Then I’ll deliver
the Paper Bombs
195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,140
we’ve gathered thus far
to Grandma Tsunade,
196
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,590
so you wait here.
197
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,590
Okay.
198
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,350
I’ll be right back!
199
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,800
Ichiraku Ramen
200
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,590
The old man was standing here
the first time I met him.
201
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,890
I thought he was just
a ramen-loving old man, but…
202
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,590
Hm?
203
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,640
Could it be that what
he was looking at then was…?
204
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,590
Why in a place like this?
205
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,350
Well well…
206
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,800
So you found it, huh?
207
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Old man?
208
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,890
I guess I cannot let you
go back now, can I?
209
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,590
Thirty years ago, huh?
210
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,590
That’s around the time when
my dad was still the master carpenter.
211
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,590
It was probably a time
212
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,930
when many outsiders were hired
just like now.
213
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
But I wonder if there are records
from back then.
214
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,550
Anything would be fine.
A blueprint or a ledger.
215
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
Hey, Shikamaru.
What’re you talking about? Explain.
216
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,470
Why did the referral vanish?
217
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,720
Referral? You mean the real referral
218
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,800
that became the catalyst for
Genno being suspected?
219
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,180
It was bugging me the whole time.
220
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,050
Perhaps the disappearance of
the referral was Genno’s doing.
221
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,550
But why was it necessary
to get rid of it?
222
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,720
It all makes sense
if we consider the referral
223
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,590
that disappeared was a fake, too.
224
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,590
What do you mean?
225
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,220
But that referral was always here.
226
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
So it was Genno himself
227
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,100
who came here to work with
that referral thirty years ago.
228
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,350
Oh!
229
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,850
That is to say…probably.
230
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,100
At that time, he used a referral
231
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,050
that couldn’t be distinguished
from the real thing.
232
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,010
And then he went to the trouble
of making one
233
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,720
that would be recognized as
a fake if compared with that one.
234
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,720
Why?
235
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,140
Even with old referrals,
236
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,140
he would be discovered
if reinvestigated again.
237
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,680
So he got rid of it right after
you blew the whistle on him.
238
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,470
In order to conceal the fact that
he worked here thirty years ago.
239
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,510
It’s because at that time in the village,
240
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,180
he set as many Paper Bombs
as were available.
241
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
Why?
242
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,510
Why’d you do such a thing?!
243
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,050
Long ago, there was a village
244
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,590
called Heat Devil Village in
the Land of Mountains.
245
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,680
This is the village where I was born.
246
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,590
Heat Devil Village?
247
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,180
You don’t know it?
248
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,180
No…
249
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,850
The only thing recorded in
the Bingo Book you brought
250
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,640
is that Genno’s homeland is
the Land of Mountains.
251
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,390
To be precise, Heat Devil Village
in the Land of Mountains.
252
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,590
The village itself vanished,
253
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,510
so it probably ended up
not being recorded.
254
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,590
Thirty years ago,
255
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,590
the Village Hidden in Leaves
and Heat Devil Village were at war.
256
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,590
Neither side didn’t give an inch
and the battle was in deadlock.
257
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,260
We launched a successful sneak attack
on Heat Devil Village,
258
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,590
taking advantage of the absence
of their main forces.
259
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,800
The tide of the war turned to
the Leaf’s advantage in one shot.
260
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,590
The only thing written
in the history books
261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,510
is that an armistice was concluded
three months after that.
262
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,590
These three months are what’s peculiar.
263
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,220
Heat Devil Village should’ve been thinking
about a counterattack
264
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,930
before accepting a cease fire.
265
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,590
Here it is.
lt’s my dad’s diary from thirty years ago.
266
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,970
Really?
267
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,180
Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully.
268
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,890
Here.
269
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,850
Thanks.
270
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,680
"A middle-aged man from
the Hidden Sand came
271
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,640
"with a master carpentry referral."
272
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,350
"His skills aren’t great, but I decided
to hire him as I want manpower."
273
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,180
The date is one week after
the Heat Devil Village attack.
274
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,720
Then like you thought…
275
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,680
Checkmate. This is Genno.
276
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,550
It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf
277
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,220
and to set Paper Bombs
throughout the village.
278
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,390
The operation was for the main forces
of Heat Devil Village
279
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,640
to invade the Village Hidden
in the Leaves at the same time
280
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,760
as the Paper Bomb explosions
and inflict a devastating blow.
281
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,590
I went out to various sites and
set Paper Bombs.
282
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,760
The Leaf village did not have substantial
Anbu Black Ops as they do now.
283
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,590
So I was able to move about with ease.
284
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,590
Right around the time when
two and a half months had passed,
285
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,680
I finished setting almost all
of the Paper Bombs…
286
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,850
and all that was left was to wait
for my comrades to attack.
287
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,050
But my comrades never came.
288
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,930
Why?
289
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,140
The leader of Heat Devil Village who
had insisted on “do-or-die” resistance;
290
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,140
lost his life in an accident.
291
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,890
And the man who assumed
the position of leader in his place
292
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,100
agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf.
293
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,010
What?
294
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,890
"Genno doesn’t show up at the scene.
I wonder what the deal is."
295
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,590
He disappeared having left
behind the Paper Bombs.
296
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,930
As for me, my intention was to
immediately return to the Hidden Leaf.
297
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,760
I thought the ceasefire would just
be a temporary thing anyway.
298
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,140
But Heat Devil Village would never
give me another mission.
299
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,590
Two weeks after the ceasefire,
300
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,470
the Village Hidden in the Vale launched
a sneak attack on Heat Devil Village
301
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,760
and it was destroyed.
302
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,800
No way!
303
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,800
They were targeted at a moment
304
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,140
when they were weariest from
the battle with the Leaf.
305
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,590
Their defenses were probably
also down due to the ceasefire.
306
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,590
"Two months has passed since…
307
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,600
Where did Genno disappear off to…?"
308
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,390
Then why come back to the Leaf Village
now after all this time?
309
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,680
You set Paper Bombs because
it was your mission, right?
310
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,220
If Heat Devil Village is no more,
311
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,590
then there should be no reason
to go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf!
312
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,720
Could it be…someone asked you
to smash the Leaf?
313
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,390
Rest easy.
314
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,430
I haven’t been commissioned
or commanded by anyone.
315
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,470
Then why?
316
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,100
How can I put this? It felt like a waste.
317
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,760
A waste? What’s up with that?
318
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,680
I’m getting old and I could be taken
to heaven any time now.
319
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,430
If I were to die as is,
320
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,300
I’d be buried in darkness without
anyone learning of my traps.
321
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,680
If so, then I thought I’d put them
to good use before I die.
322
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,220
Are you serious?
323
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,180
You tried to kill people in the village
just for that reason?
324
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,800
I can’t believe that!
325
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,850
Then treating me to ramen was to…
326
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,390
It was to find out
327
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,220
about the present state
of affairs in the Leaf.
328
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,640
Damn you! You jerk!
329
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,220
You’ll understand when you get older!
330
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,800
I don’t understand!
As for me…
331
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,590
I won’t ever understand it!
332
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,930
I’ll show you my final big job
as a Trapper!
333
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,930
No way will I let you do that!
334
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:28,350
My friends are now in the middle
of removing all the Paper Bombs!
335
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,140
I won’t let the bombs blow up!
336
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,590
Sounds like quite a struggle.
337
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,970
But who said I was going to
blow up the Paper Bombs?
338
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,430
What’re you talking about?
You just said that before you die…
339
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,260
I said I would put them to good use.
You’re naïve, boy.
340
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,550
What?
341
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,590
I can put them to sufficiently good use
even without blowing them up.
342
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,510
Katsu!
343
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,430
A Shinobi reads two
or three moves ahead
344
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,100
and prepares several moves
in advance.
345
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,430
Remember that!
346
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,600
Shikamaru!
347
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,300
What is it?
348
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,590
The Academy students are saying
they’re tired.
349
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,510
What should we do?
350
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,050
The Academy students?
351
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,050
The Kunai Knife practice, right?
352
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
What? They were still doing that?
353
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,470
You idiot! You were the one
who had them do it.
354
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,760
Oh, oh yeah. Then have them
go ahead wrap things up.
355
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,590
Rather, it’d be trouble if they were
to get lucky and hit the center.
356
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,100
Oh!
357
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,590
What is it?
358
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,600
I get it. So that’s it!
359
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,890
It’s unnatural for a guy so prepared
360
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,470
to casually entrust the
final explosive device to pure luck.
361
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,680
What do you mean?
362
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,260
A Shinobi of Genno’s level should blow
it up with the most effective timing.
363
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,600
In other words,
364
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,970
it doesn’t matter whether
the Paper Bombs explode or not.
365
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,720
It’s just a diversion.
366
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,470
He’s really after something else!
367
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,890
On a checkerboard night
368
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,510
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
369
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,890
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
370
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,050
Suggestively
371
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,800
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
372
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,590
The Trombone gradually going off-key
373
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,100
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
374
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,140
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
375
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,350
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
376
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,510
Choji, things might get pretty ugly.
377
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,590
You’ve figured something out, huh?
378
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,970
We need to contact
the Fifth Hokage.
379
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,590
To not let the returning forces
enter the village.
380
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,220
Got it! But… Why?
381
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,100
If the Paper Bombs were
all a diversion,
382
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,680
then the moment he makes his move
383
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
is most likely when
the main forces return!
384
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,720
What?!
385
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,970
Shikamaru! Choji! We’ve got trouble!
386
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,930
What happened, Hinata?!
387
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,720
Naruto… Naruto’s in trouble!
388
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,590
Next time: “Multiple Traps!
Countdown to Destruction”
//%
1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:13,860
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,540
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,230
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,800
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,900
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,130
Our two hearts
11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,520
His music is a Ninjutsu?
12
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,550
Yeah! Awesome Chakra started bursting
throughout my body.
13
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,560
My power goes up like crazy!
14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,390
That’s a rare Jutsu, isn’t it?
15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,560
Shizune, have we identified the one
who attacked the villagers?
16
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,800
No, not yet…
17
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,840
Menma. I’ve once heard of
a Jutsu similar to yours.
18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,310
– What?!
– Is that true, Grandma?!
19
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,540
I seem to recall that
the Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu
20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,280
that use musical instruments as
the catalysts.
21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,210
Land of Rice Paddies?
You mean that Land of Rice Paddies?
22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,180
Come to think of it,
23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,520
the upper part of the mountain stream
where Naruto found Menma was…
24
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,550
Land of Rice Paddies?
25
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,920
Please allow me to go there!
26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,060
But infiltrating another land
without cause is…
27
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,560
No, we do have cause!
28
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,900
There might be hints there
about Menma’s lost memory.
29
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,930
I’d also like to make that request.
30
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,070
Very well.
31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,570
Excellent, Grandma!
Now you’re talking!
32
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,010
Thank you.
33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,660
Bringing Back Reality
34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,530
And so we’ll be heading out for a bit.
35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,630
Right, got it.
36
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,130
The special pickled bamboo shoots
should be ready
37
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,860
by the time you guys get back.
38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,830
I can’t wait. Bye!
39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,440
Really, there’s no real need
for you guys to come.
40
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,710
We have no choice. It’s a mission.
41
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,650
Our mission is to accompany you guys!
42
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,350
Now that it’s settled…
43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Let’s get to the Land of Rice Paddies!
44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,230
Right.
45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,690
– Naruto. 					– Huh?
46
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,090
You stay here.
47
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,960
Huh?
48
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,570
What do you want, Grandma?
49
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,740
If you’re any kind of sorry excuse
for a Shinobi, you should know.
50
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,540
What?
51
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,440
I’m talking about Menma.
lf that kid is a…
52
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,610
No way is he a bad guy.
53
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,710
I know he’s not a bad person.
54
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,710
But can you state flatly that
he’s not an enemy spy?
55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,020
What’re you driving at, Grandma?!
56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,390
You couldn’t have forgotten.
57
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,320
The Village Hidden in Sound
in the Land of Rice Paddies
58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,590
is the place where Orochimaru
once hid himself.
59
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,090
Well, I…
60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,230
I…remember that, but…
61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,670
Menma’s Jutsu is strikingly similar to that
of the opponent Shikamaru fought
62
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,110
when Sasuke was taken away.
63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
There’s no denying there’s a chance
64
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,380
he’s affiliated with
the Hidden Sound Village.
65
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,510
And if he remembers something and
that was to become a threat to this land…
66
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,590
No way could Menma be an enemy…
That just can’t be!
67
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,010
We’ll leave you behind if you dawdle!
68
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,540
Naruto, I’m going on ahead!
69
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,560
Are you hurt?
70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,760
No… Thanks for the help.
71
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,930
You were going a bit too fast.
72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,300
Let’s take a break.
73
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,550
What the heck’s wrong?!
74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,250
Who in the world is he?
75
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,050
We’re going to investigate
because we don’t know that.
76
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,820
I was running at full speed earlier.
77
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,330
Losing my footing on the branch
after that was on purpose, though…
78
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,090
What?
79
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,500
Not only did he keep up with my speed,
80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,460
but he even showed
the composure to save me.
81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,300
He is better than us in terms of speed.
82
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,270
He’d be a troublesome opponent
if we end up fighting.
83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,110
Wha--?
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
84
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,810
He’s not an enemy!
85
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,310
He risks his life to rescue babies.
86
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,550
And he’s the kind of guy who,
if left on his own,
87
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,420
would help those in trouble all day!
88
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,560
That’s a nice sound.
89
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
I still hadn’t thanked you
for fixing this for me.
90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,670
Don’t worry about it.
91
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,540
Hey!
92
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,140
Stop playing that right now!
93
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,940
If you don’t…
94
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,550
Neji. What’s the big idea?!
95
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,050
You keep quiet!
96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,420
What?!
97
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,650
It’s as Neji says.
98
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,520
That might’ve been
a signal to an enemy!
99
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,890
A signal?
100
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,260
Lady Tsunade approved this mission
because the suspicious person
101
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,300
who entered the village the other day
still hasn’t been caught!
102
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,370
If that intruder has followed Menma…
103
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,270
he should be close to us now.
104
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
No way…
105
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,440
As of this point, he hasn’t shown
his presence, though.
106
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,510
Our mission is to accompany Naruto,
107
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,010
verify his identity and
to capture the intruder!
108
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,080
Sorry, but I don’t trust you!
109
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,560
That’s right…
lt’s natural I’d be thought of like that…
110
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,990
I think about this
from time to time…
111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,500
What kind of a person was I?
112
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,570
What would I do if I were
a bad person…?
113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,140
Naruto, what kind of person would
you want to be if you were reborn?
114
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,370
Wh-What’s this all of a sudden?
115
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,580
I’m speaking figuratively…
116
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,550
I’ve never thought about it.
117
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,550
I see…
118
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,180
But why do you ask
something like that?
119
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh, no special reason…
120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
What is it?
121
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,120
What’s this smell?
122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Now that you mention it,
it smells like something’s burning.
123
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,960
Over there.
124
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,760
Let’s go.
125
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,570
The smell came from here…
126
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,210
Was there a fire or something…?
127
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,600
Is something wrong?
128
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,930
No…
129
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,840
It’s nothing.
130
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Don’t move. I’ll fire if you move.
131
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,360
What’s the deal all of a sudden?
132
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,560
Are you their minions?
133
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
“Their”?
134
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,560
You’ll die here if
you’re comrades of theirs.
135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,260
For crying out loud, who are they?!
136
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,070
If you say you’re not,
then show me some proof!
137
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,540
Proof, why? We’re Leaf Shinobi.
138
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Hidden Leaf Village?
139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,110
See? Look at this.
140
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,640
Indeed that is…
141
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,150
What do Leaf Shinobi want
in a place like this?
142
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,880
Well, we just happened
to be passing through and…
143
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,390
As you can see, there’s nothing here.
144
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,590
If you don’t have business here,
just beat it.
145
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,460
If you don’t,
we can’t guarantee your life.
146
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,130
What’s with him talking all big?!
147
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,400
Here, he was the one
who picked the fight.
148
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,000
Once we’ve had our breather,
149
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,610
let’s blow this joint and go look
for Menma’s memory.
150
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,310
R-Right…
151
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
What? Did you remember something?
152
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,540
No…
153
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,550
Who’s there? Come on out.
154
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,690
Hello.
155
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,400
Y-You guys are Ninja, right?
156
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,100
I heard what you were talking
about earlier…
157
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,340
Oh, well, I don’t want to brag, but…
158
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,640
If you’re talking about Naruto Uzumaki
from Hidden Leaf Village,
159
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,750
I’m pretty well known.
160
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,550
Really? I’m sorry, I didn’t know.
161
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,550
Why did you go to the trouble
of following us?
162
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,890
Umm… I had a favor to ask…
163
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,690
My older brother said
what he did earlier, but…
164
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,120
Older brother?!
165
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,860
That jerk from earlier?
166
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,560
We need someone to save our village!
167
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,540
A person to save your village…?
168
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,540
What do you mean?
169
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,570
This was the border of
the Land of Rice Paddies.
170
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,280
But…
171
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,550
as our land had caused trouble
for other lands,
172
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,880
this area was turned into
a demilitarized zone.
173
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,720
Are you talking about
that thing in question…?
174
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,350
It must be the incident
involving Orochimaru.
175
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,860
That’s how things were settled
with all the neighboring lands, huh?
176
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,800
But if it’s a demilitarized zone,
there won’t be any territorial dispute, right?
177
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,800
That’s right.
178
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,970
It’s not like that.
179
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,670
There’s a small mine
in the hills behind the village
180
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,540
and a little bit of gold can be dug up.
181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,140
Once it was discovered that mine is not
being supervised by a proprietary land,
182
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,440
bandits started coming with
their eyes on the gold…
183
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,550
No matter how often we asked
the feudal lord,
184
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,350
he would insist that, “Agreements between
fellow lands must not be broken.”
185
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,720
And the village…
186
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,750
It was attacked by bandits, right?
187
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,630
They withdrew in the middle of it
due to a terrible storm before.
188
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,360
But they’ll definitely be back.
189
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,570
I beg you. Please save our village.
190
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,170
You guys could fight them!
191
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,540
All right! Got it…
192
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,540
I’m sorry.
193
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,170
We can understand the situation,
but we can’t cooperate.
194
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,010
Huh? What’re you saying, Neji?!
195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,310
We’re in the middle of a mission!
196
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,550
We can’t act unless
we have an official order from the village!
197
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,620
But…
198
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,550
Besides, we don’t know
when the bandits will be back.
199
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,220
We can’t just strand
ourselves here forever!
200
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,160
Damn it…
201
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,560
I see…
202
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,690
What’re you doing Ran,
even bringing Fuki here?
203
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,730
Big Brother…
204
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,570
Don’t get involved with them.
There’s no such thing as a good Ninja.
205
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,100
Say what?!
206
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,470
I just stated the truth.
207
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,540
The rumor has it that the guys who
attacked the village were Rogue Shinobi
208
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
from the Hidden Sound Village.
209
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,540
Huh? The bandits are Ninja?
210
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,210
Come this way.
211
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,620
Look at that.
212
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,320
Wh-What’s this?!
213
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,520
One-third of the villagers were killed
in the attack the other day.
214
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,690
Half of the rest abandoned
the village and fled.
215
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,060
Then you guys should also evacuate…
216
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,430
Where are we supposed to flee?!
217
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,570
This is ancestral land
that’s been handed down to us
218
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,930
and that we’ve cultivated.
219
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,000
Why should we have to flee from that?!
220
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,940
Each time the hooligans
brandish their power,
221
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,840
we have to accept it like
a natural disaster and do nothing?!
222
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,510
Are we to just flee from place to place?!
223
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,980
Don’t shout, Big Brother.
224
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,650
Fuki will get scared.
225
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,550
I’m sorry I shouted…
226
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,760
Her parents were killed by bandits
and she lost her ability to speak.
227
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,560
There’s no place for us to escape.
228
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,800
If that’s clear, then beat it already.
229
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,600
We have no choice.
Let’s hurry on ahead.
230
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,970
I’m staying here.
231
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,570
Huh?
232
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,110
I want to be of use if
those people are in trouble.
233
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,110
Menma!
234
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,050
Hey, you don’t even know
the scale of the bandits.
235
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,980
If you want to help them,
no matter what,
236
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,550
then we should go back
to the village and…
237
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,660
We don’t know when they might attack.
238
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,860
We don’t have the time
to return to the village!
239
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,260
Then, I’m staying, too!
240
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,060
Naruto! Anything further than this
is beyond the scope of the mission!
241
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,760
This isn’t beyond the scope
of the mission!
242
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,070
I get the feeling I’ll be able to
remember something if I stay here.
243
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,440
Don’t say irresponsible things!
244
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,140
You couldn’t remember anything
just a moment ago…
245
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,540
That’s too convenient!
246
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,540
It can’t be helped, right?
Menma himself is saying so.
247
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,550
He’s good-natured to a fault!
248
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,550
Naruto…
249
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,550
Let’s go, Menma.
250
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,420
Right.
251
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,650
Hey, Naruto!
252
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,220
We’ll deal with the bandits.
253
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,190
You guys go on back
to the village ahead.
254
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,560
What do we do, Neji?!
255
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,860
Leave them be.
256
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,500
It’s unlikely the villagers will
accept Naruto and Menma.
257
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,670
You’ve got a point…
258
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,270
It seems the settlement on the other side
has escaped damage, huh?
259
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,540
But how’re we supposed to protect
the village just the two of us…?
260
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Let’s build a wall along this creek.
This river will play the role of a moat.
261
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,520
Ultimately we’ll make a temporary bridge
262
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,320
and have the entrance to the village
in just one location.
263
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,550
I get it…
264
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,560
I don’t know how effective it’ll be,
265
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
but let’s just do the best
we can now.
266
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,560
Right.
267
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,320
What’re you doing? I told you to get out.
268
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,490
We won’t get out!
269
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,560
What did you say?!
270
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,570
We decided to protect
the village on our own.
271
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,800
Nobody asked you to do that.
lt’s none of your business!
272
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,540
You may say that,
273
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,310
but you can’t beat them off
by just hiding in your houses!
274
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,350
All right, let’s stabilize it with a stake.
275
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,250
Got it…
276
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,390
Jeez, what can they do
just the two of them?!
277
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,570
I’m ready…
278
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,570
Okay.
279
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,450
Tenten! You’re still here?!
280
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,420
Can’t you at least say thanks first?
281
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,750
Thanks, Tenten.
282
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,760
Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right.
283
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,060
R-Right…
284
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,070
You are…
285
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,930
For me?
286
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,670
Then I’ll help myself.
287
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,270
Have this, too.
288
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,980
I’ll help out, too.
289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
You’re mine!
290
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,530
Not yet!
291
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,310
That technique!
292
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,210
It’s from that time!
293
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,150
Neji! You…
294
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,050
It’s our mission this time around
to catch this guy.
295
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,650
Heh! This guy’s formidable.
296
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,770
Damn it!
297
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,930
He’s quick to escape!
298
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,680
Naruto!
299
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
The sound waves pierced my whole
Chakra Network all at once
300
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,570
and amplified the flow of Chakra?
301
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,770
I won’t lose to the likes of this guy
if I have this Jutsu!
302
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,390
This is to avenge everyone.
303
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,230
Eat this!
304
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,560
You’re in my way!
305
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,500
Menma!
306
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,540
Menma! Menma!
307
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,580
Carry him to the village.
308
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,180
Manma! Hang in there!
309
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,350
Boiling water and alcohol!
310
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,220
All right.
311
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,720
Are you going to treat him?
312
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,020
I may not look it,
but I’ve played at being a doctor.
313
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,820
We’ll save you now, Menma.
314
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,790
What’s the matter?
315
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,300
I cannot treat this guy…
316
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,270
Wh-Why not?!
317
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,410
This mark…
318
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,380
He’s a comrade of a guy
who attacked here…!
319
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,430
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
320
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,600
Will always be smiling right near by
321
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,540
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
322
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,110
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
323
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,020
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
324
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,860
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
325
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,800
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
326
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,170
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
327
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
328
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:15,010
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
329
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,880
The wind is probably testing our hearts
330
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,220
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
331
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,390
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
332
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,230
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
333
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,830
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
334
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,010
Will always be smiling right near by
335
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,480
Menma is not a member of the bandits.
336
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,390
I mean, he loves helping people!
337
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,560
He’s a type of guy who would even risk
his own life in order to save a kid!
338
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,690
For this village too,
339
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,960
he has worked hard, so hard,
even though no one really asked for it.
340
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,670
He’s got to have some kind of reason.
341
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,270
So please save Menma!
342
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,540
Next time: “A Past to Be Erased”
//%
1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,750
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,620
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,760
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,040
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,580
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,220
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,750
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,260
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,800
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,830
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,470
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,750
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,920
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:19,760
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,220
All right, thanks for waiting!
16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,220
"The Special Presentation Today!"
17
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,930
"The Top 5 Famous
Sweat and Tears Ninja Battles!
18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,300
"There Are Also Fun Extras"
has finally started!
19
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,770
Isn't this exciting, Sakura?!
20
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,800
Yes, from the next episode,
21
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,100
“Naruto” which you’ve all
been supporting
22
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,110
for the past four years
will enter its fifth year.
23
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,640
And so today,
we’re changing our plans
24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,810
to present you with
famous battle scenes
25
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,380
in the order determined by
votes from the guys in the Leaf!
26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,950
Is that favorite battle you want
to see again included?
27
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,220
We’ve also invited
some special guests,
28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,120
so don’t miss it!
29
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,030
Then, we’ll be moving on ahead.
30
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,760
First, check out fifth and
fourth place back to back!
31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,640
FIFTH PLACE
NARUTO VS. SASUKE
~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~
32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
All right, here we go,
here we go, here we go!
33
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,580
Just what you’d expect of me,
the hero!
34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,410
To think I’d appear right at the start.
35
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,210
I’ve shrewdly got everyone’s hearts!
36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,920
You’re right!
37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,120
To be honest,
38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,850
the coolness of Sasuke in motion
is unfathomable.
39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,120
Outstanding destructive power.
Cha!
40
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,760
Umm, Sakura?
41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,560
Our comments aren’t meshing
right off the bat.
42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,060
Just keep quiet!
43
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Right.
44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,340
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
45
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,750
Attack and defense with
no time to breathe.
46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,350
This is gripping.
47
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,290
Throw in a kick there!
48
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,260
Give him a beat down and thrash up!
49
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,630
Umm, Sakura. How about
a little support for the hero there…?
50
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,700
Shut up, Naruto!
51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,710
Naruto Barrage!
52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,980
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
53
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,550
Wh-What’s that Jutsu?!
54
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,030
You jerk!
55
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Chidori!
56
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,870
Stop it…you two…
57
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,300
Stop it!
58
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,620
That’s mean to punch me all
of a sudden, Sakura!
59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,120
I couldn’t help it.
I got excited.
60
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,090
FOURTH PLACE
CHOJI VS. JIROBO
~FATSO VS. FATSO~
Now, let’s collect ourselves
and check out fourth place next!
61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,760
It’s too late whatever you do now!
62
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,560
Crushing Palm!
63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,340
Man, this battle moves me to tears,
no matter how often I watch it.
64
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,470
That’s right! As it happens,
65
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,840
I sat down on my knees in front of
the TV while blowing my nose.
66
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,680
It invoked tears in the living rooms
in the Land of Fire for sure.
67
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,420
Yeah, yeah… I really thought
Choji had died in this episode.
68
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,720
That’s for sure.
69
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,250
I was also totally fooled
by the producers.
70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,720
Wh-What’s that…?
71
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,260
But…
72
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,790
Boulder Blow!
73
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
It’s futile!
74
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,740
I’m a hundred times stronger
than before!
75
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,750
They say a grudge over food
is ferocious, right?
76
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,520
That one punch just now
77
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,190
was the grudge for you eating
the last bite of the snack.
78
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,530
No way! He’s got so much Chakra
his build has changed!
79
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,530
And this is…
80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,270
This is for insulting me by calling me
a sacrificial piece and fat!
81
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:04,340
But what’s most unforgivable is
you insulting my best friend!
82
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,350
That’s more unforgivable than
swiping the last bite of gourmet food
83
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,750
or insulting me by calling me fat!
84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,660
All my Chakra…
to my left hand!
85
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,700
O-Oh, no…!
86
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,770
This one punch is heavier than life!
87
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,100
W-Wait…! 					Don’t be hasty…!
88
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,750
But seeing it again,
visually it’s just fatso versus fatso.
89
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,760
No appealing parts at all
and the screen is stifling.
90
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,090
I mean, no way would I want
to see this during the summer
91
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,630
Excuse me for being stifling.
92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Yikes! Choji.
93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
How long were you there…?
94
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,330
I heard my famous battle made it
into the top five, you see…
95
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,370
Oh wait, Choji.
96
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,970
– You’ll understand once I tell you!
– Calm down!
97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,100
Human Boulder!
97.01	01:57:15:03	01:57:16:07	I won!
98
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,750
I actually…won!
99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,760
We had a bit of an incident here,
100
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
but let’s not worry about that
and move on.
101
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,200
Now before we present
third to first place,
102
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,870
we’ll show the famous battles
left out of the top five.
103
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,040
Is the famous battle
you chose included?
104
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,710
Now then, here we go!
105
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
EXTRA SEGMENT
UNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES
106
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,080
KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA
~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~
107
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,710
– Rooster! 					– Rooster!
108
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,750
– Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
– Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,020
Sure enough, Kakashi Sensei’s
Sharingan is super unfair!
110
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,120
Just what you’d expect from a Jonin.
111
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,270
KAKASHI VS. GAI
~ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS~
112
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
– What?! 					– You’re late!
113
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,340
– This is a famous battle?!
– You’re seventeen minutes
114
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,580
– Well, it’s cool to have stuff like this
– and thirty two seconds late!
115
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,510
– included once in a while, right?
– Let’s forget about today…
116
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,650
We both have forty eight wins!
117
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,220
One of us will move ahead
with this battle!
118
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,750
It seems it won’t work
even if I say no…
119
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,430
This time it’s my turn to determine
the battle category…
120
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,900
What will it be?
A Taijutsu fight?
121
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
A 100-meter dash?
122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,670
Skin diving? I wouldn’t mind
an eating contest…
123
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,440
Listen, you…
124
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,440
Well then…
125
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,370
Wh-What?!
126
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,370
Rock-paper-scissors!
127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,340
I accept the challenge.
No way will I lose!
128
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,180
If I lose, I’ll do five hundred laps
129
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,320
around the Leaf Village
standing on my head!
130
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,750
Absurdity again…
131
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
It’s a promise!
132
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,760
Here we go again…
His favorite own rules.
133
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,260
Okay, everyone together now.
134
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,130
– Rock-paper… 					– Rock-paper…
135
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Scissors!
136
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,600
After the commercial,
we’ll present third to first place.
137
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Don’t miss it.
138
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,180
Now at last for the presentation
of third to first place.
139
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,810
First up is third place!
140
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,750
Now then, which battle has worked
its way up to the higher ranks?
141
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,660
Here we go! The appearance of
the famous team of Kiba and Akamaru!
142
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
– Heh! 					– Damn it…
143
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,090
– It’s the appearance of
– Is it all over…?
144
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,060
a team that’s just loud.
145
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,700
What?!
You’re saying to do that?!
146
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,130
No, Akamaru!
147
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,640
It’s too dangerous to do that
without any comrades around!
148
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,340
You understand that, don’t you?!
149
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,410
We’ll die like dogs here if we miss…
150
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,650
Ow!
151
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Akamaru…
152
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,630
To think I’d get bitten by you.
I’m a pathetic owner…
153
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,170
Okay, Akamaru…
As you say, we just have to do that…
154
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,470
Wolf Fang Over Fang!
155
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Now, Akamaru!
156
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,690
What?!
157
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,960
Show him the fruits of our training!
158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,060
Dynamic Marking!
159
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,130
That’s a dirty trick!
160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,760
Now we’re ready!
161
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,040
Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast
Transformation Combo!
162
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,850
Two-Headed Wolf!
163
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,750
Eat this!
164
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,460
Sakon, what’re you doing! To the right!
165
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Uh oh…!
166
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,330
Wolf Fang Over Fang!
167
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,430
Though he sometimes bites
his owner’s hand,
168
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,470
he presses for a decision.
169
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,740
It seems Akamaru’s stock shot up
in the Leaf after this.
170
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,740
What a man!
171
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,750
Man, my butt! Just a puppy
whose evil eyes got worse!
172
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,550
Who has evil eyes?!
173
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,520
Yikes, Kiba!
174
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,850
H-How long were you there…?
175
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,420
Knock it off!
176
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,290
Here I was invited as a guest
177
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,790
with my battle
having been ranked high.
178
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,930
What’s the deal of
finishing in third place
179
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,760
on top of being told mean things?!
180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,770
It’s Kiba and Akamaru
who finished in third.
181
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,500
Please face the camera
182
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,610
and say a few words to everyone
in their living rooms.
183
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,810
Oh, umm, thanks for your support.
184
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,080
Well, we came in third this time.
185
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,780
But we’ll kick the butts of some enemies,
186
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,390
so please look forward
to our success!
187
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,890
Considering you’re talking
all big or whatever,
188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,660
didn’t you have a rough time
with it after this?
189
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,830
The best is yet to come,
I tell you!
190
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,770
That’s the last straw.
Get him, Akamaru!
191
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,040
Now for the presentation
of second place.
192
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,050
He’s like a completely different person…
193
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,750
His Chakra activity is overwhelming…
194
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,660
And those markings…
195
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,970
The movements earlier…
196
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,740
He dodged the attack from behind
197
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,970
and saw me hiding in the shadows…
198
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,080
In other words, he’s combining
wide vision and x-ray vision.
199
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,720
And in addition, that Jutsu…
200
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,750
Then…
201
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,660
Summoning Jutsu!
202
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,440
I’ll find a perfect…
way to attack that power of yours.
203
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,750
If he defends physical attacks
with rotation
204
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,520
and a large emission of Chakra…
205
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,720
then I should stop that Chakra rotation!
206
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,790
– This is the second place battle?
– Scatter!
207
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,230
That’s right! It’s a battle of brains while
assessing the opponent’s weak point!
208
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,960
Hmm. But as for me…
209
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,870
I’m not a big fan of sluggish battles!
210
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,830
– Oh, why? 					– Hmm.
211
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,970
How can I put it?
lf you’re talking about battle
212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,970
I want to see a collision of fist
on fist, and body on body.
213
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,010
Oh, but a Ninja isn’t just
about Taijutsu.
214
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,950
Oh. That’s being rude to Bushy Brow.
215
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,010
Oh, sorry.
216
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,920
I mean, yeah, I want to see
217
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,080
something fiery, like Bushy Brow!
218
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,750
There just isn’t anything fiery
in Neji’s battles.
219
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Here!
220
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
He’s argumentative or something.
221
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,230
Unexciting or something.
222
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,760
I’d like him to just take on the enemy
without regard to appearances!
223
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,540
Heh! Missions with you are
a chore because you think like that.
224
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,540
Yikes, Neji!
225
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,180
Now then, a few words from
the second place Neji.
226
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,740
Humph! How silly.
227
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,750
You’re free to evaluate my battles,
but it’s unthinkable
228
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,750
for me to be forced to appear
in a place like this.
229
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,920
Heh! You’re sure making
an exhibition of yourself, considering!
230
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,290
Oh! Could it be you’re after
an appearance fee?!
231
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,830
Too bad.
232
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,100
This is a program for everyone
in their living rooms,
233
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,430
so we asked you to do this for free!
234
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,170
No problem.
I asked the Fifth Hokage
235
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,740
and she’s treating this appearance
as a mission.
236
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,740
Since it’s a mission,
I have no choice but to appear.
237
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,350
And of course, a mission fee
will be incurred.
238
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,750
Whoa, always the realist.
239
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,390
Neji, it’s not fair that
you get paid for this!
240
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,460
My brain is built differently than yours!
241
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,430
Gentle Fist!
242
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,200
It seems the ranking board is busted,
243
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,600
so we’ll go right on ahead
and present first place.
244
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,670
Which battle has finished in first?
245
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,810
Chidori!
246
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,850
Oh ho! Sure enough, it’s pointless
247
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,250
if the number one battle
isn’t one of my battles!
248
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,350
That’s right!
This is the battle that
249
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,220
anyone would
acknowledge as number one.
250
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,830
Rasengan!
251
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,390
– Rasengan! 					– Chidori!
252
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,100
And so, did you all guess right?
253
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,340
The glorious best battle has been
determined to be “Sasuke’s Battle!”
254
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,140
Hey, hey, Sakura.
lt’s the “Battle in the Final Valley”!
255
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,280
FIRST PLACE
NARUTO VS. SASUKE
~FINAL VALLEY~
What? Was it?
256
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,810
Forget it.
257
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,550
Well, let’s collect ourselves
and check out
258
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,760
some special footage of myself,
who came in a glorious first place!
259
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Y-You…idiot!
260
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,760
Hold it!
What’s up with this recording?!
261
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,300
– This is different from what I prepared!
– What’re you doing?!
262
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,770
– No, no, don’t watch!
– Don’t be peeping!
263
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,740
I demand a do-over as the hero!
264
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,810
Someone not involved is
making a ruckus.
265
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,740
And now, thanks for waiting!
266
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,810
Now for the appearance of
a special guest.
267
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,380
Let’s go live to the site.
Master Jiraiya!
268
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
What? What?
269
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,590
Master Jiraiya, can you hear me?
270
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,150
Yes… Loud and clear.
271
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,420
What?
272
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,390
Master Jiraiya,
where are you right now?
273
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,630
Mm, I’m in kind of a dubious place.
274
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,670
I hope you’ll excuse me from
divulging my location.
275
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,500
Well, if I have to say something,
276
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,200
I’d say I’m in a certain person’s
hideout, I guess.
277
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,740
Hey! Pervy Sage!
What’re you doing there?!
278
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,740
What happened to you
watching my training?!
279
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,180
Now, now.
Today’s a special program,
280
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,520
so don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.
281
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,750
More importantly,
I’ve met up with someone special…
282
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,920
None other than Orochimaru.
283
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
What?!
284
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Sakura…
What the hell is this…?!
285
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,130
It sure has been a long time,
Orochimaru!
286
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,200
Oh, same here…
287
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,740
Here you could have invited me
to the studio.
288
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,840
Who would invite the likes of you?!
289
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,750
Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsu
and conducting experiments.
290
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,420
And more importantly,
I need him to get stronger quickly, so.
291
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,260
– If he’s there, bring him out!
– What…?!
292
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:45,260
Actually, I tried talking him into it
many times saying today’s special…
293
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,770
But in the end,
he didn’t give me a good answer.
294
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,300
– I see… 					– Hey.
295
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,340
What?!
296
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,170
Are you going to go
on and on forever?
297
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,710
If you’ve got that kind of time,
then continue the training, Orochimaru.
298
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,740
S-Sasuke…
299
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,050
Sasuke…
ls that you, Sasuke?!
300
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,920
I’ll be going on ahead to the dojo.
Get a move on.
301
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,620
Oh, wait…!
302
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,520
Oh, it seems I’ve angered Sasuke.
303
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,390
I shall also be leaving now.
304
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Wait! Orochimaru!
Put Sasuke on one more time…
305
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,970
Sakura…
He can’t hear you anymore.
306
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,740
I know…
307
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,370
– Sakura… 					– Yeah. Right!
308
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
That’s right!
309
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,010
Now then,
it’s about time to say goodbye.
310
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,810
Did you all enjoy our special:
311
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,880
“The Special Presentation Today!"
312
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,750
The Top 5 Famous
Sweat and Tears Ninja Battles!
313
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,090
There Are Also Fun Extras”?
314
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,390
Hey, what’re you wrapping things
up on your own for?
315
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,060
What about my do-over
special footage?
316
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,760
You’re annoying.
317
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,970
We don’t have any time left,
so wrap things up now!
318
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,740
What?! Fine!
319
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,740
Unfortunately, my special footage will
have to wait for the next time.
320
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,080
But everyone in the village,
including me,
321
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,840
will keep showing
awesome fights one after another!
322
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,050
Everyone, please continue to support us…
323
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,050
– and keep watching “Naruto”!
– and keep watching “Naruto”!
324
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,220
SEE YOU LATER
– See you later!
– See you later!
325
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,310
On a checkerboard night
326
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,750
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
327
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,290
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
328
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,460
Suggestively
329
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,190
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
330
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,800
The Trombone gradually going off-key
331
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:11,510
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
332
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,550
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
333
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,750
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
334
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,080
I never thought that
you were so stubborn!
335
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Even if you make a fuss,
nothing's going to change.
336
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,750
But, at this rate,
she's going to abandon us.
337
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,220
It's her choice.
There's nothing we can do.
338
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Hey, Hinata!
What do you think?
339
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,090
We still don't know
what her situation is…
340
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,630
Does that mean that you're with Shino?!
341
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
It's not like that!
342
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,760
Hey, what are you fighting about?
343
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,770
Naruto, Sensei is…
344
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,830
Kurenai Sensei is going to quit!
345
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,840
Next time: "Kurenai's Decision:
Squad 8 Left Behind”
//%
1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,420
Summoning Jutsu!
2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,370
Oh, long time no see.
3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,700
We don’t have much time
to get nostalgic.
4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
We’ve got a mission.
5
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,610
That I see over there
is the Village of Artisans, isn’t it?
6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,210
Yeah. It’s a village of professionals
who develop Ninja tools.
7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,020
The exceptional Ninja tools
they develop are also
8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,820
supplied to us
in the Five Great Nations…
9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,360
But there’s been
a strange rumor recently.
10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,360
A strange rumor?
11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,090
Something about them developing
the ultimate weapon
12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,030
and attempting to antagonize
the Five Great Nations.
13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,830
In other words, we should
search the village and…
14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,510
verify whether or not
there is that ultimate weapon, right?
15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,710
That’s about the size of it.
16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,640
Piece of cake.
17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:40,910
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,670
The distance created between us
became too big,
19
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,640
because we were always together
20
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,640
Your honest reply, “See you…”
21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,350
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
22
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,960
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
23
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,900
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:44,640
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,950
I can feel it so close,
26
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,190
Our two hearts
27
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,410
Hey! Something strange is going on.
28
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,980
What is it?!
29
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,650
There’s not a soul in the village!
30
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,320
I also found something terrible
on top of that.
31
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,650
What?!
32
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
It’s that.
33
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,730
The coffin of Seimei, the founder of
the Village of Artisans.
34
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,400
Even his body is…
35
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,670
This is serious.
36
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,640
The artisans abandoned their village.
Where in the world did they go?
37
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,810
The Targeted Shukaku
38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
I’m hungry, I’m hungry!
39
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,460
Maybe I’ll treat myself and have
two eggs in my ramen today.
40
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Huh?
41
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,910
What’s going on there?!
42
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,470
Did I keep you waiting by any chance?
43
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,310
Not really. I just got here a bit before.
44
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,650
That’s good… Then, here.
45
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,320
I made sure to hand it to you.
46
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,650
Yeah, yeah. What a pain.
47
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,920
Just a minute!
48
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,160
What’re you guys doing…
49
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,690
all in secret in a place like this
without even asking me?!
50
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,560
–Naruto? 					–Huh?
51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,270
You’re terrible, just terrible, Sakura!
52
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,700
Here you won’t even go out
on a date with me at all!
53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Why're you talking gibberish
all of a sudden?
54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,910
Ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch…
55
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,310
An errand for the Old Lady?
56
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,120
Yes. It seems a new poison
was discovered or something.
57
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,980
I delivered a list of
research medicinal substance
58
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,620
for Shikamaru’s father to prepare.
59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,120
Oh, that’s it?!
60
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,990
Jeez, you jump to conclusions.
61
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, come to think of it,
62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,360
an update report from Temari
has been delivered to Lady Tsunade.
63
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,200
An update report?
64
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,670
So? What exactly?
65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,440
I heard that the Village Hidden in
the Sand started Ninja education,
66
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,640
imitating the curriculum program
of the Leaf’s.
67
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,640
It seems that Temari and her brothers
are working as instructors.
68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,210
Instructors?!
69
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,980
Is that harsh woman fit to be
something like an instructor…?
70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,120
Really? That Gaara, huh…?
71
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,200
This is hands-on training.
72
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,740
Choose from among these
a Ninja tool that suits you.
73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
What is it?
74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,780
Do we absolutely have to choose?!
75
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
What do you mean?
76
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,220
We’ll end up hurting the other person
if we use a weapon.
77
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,650
We might kill them.
78
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,190
A weapon is…
79
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,570
No, never mind…
80
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,640
A mission isn’t a game.
81
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,580
If you were to enter a field of battle
with that frame of mind, you'd die.
82
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,420
I-I’m sorry.
83
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,850
You got Gaara angry because
you ask stupid questions.
84
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,250
You are in trouble.
85
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,460
The three of us will conduct
hands-on training.
86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,060
Gather in the respective class
of your choice.
87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,340
Gaara, put a smile on!
88
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,070
They'll get scared and nobody will
choose you with that sulky look.
89
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,080
My dad said that Gaara
was the Sand’s ultimate weapon.
90
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,650
Yeah. He's so powerful that the village
would be destroyed, if he got mad.
91
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,350
He’s scary, so let’s not bother.
92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,450
All right, I’m with Temari.
93
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,790
I’ll be with Kankuro!
94
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,320
– Me too! 					– Me too!
95
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,030
– Me too! 					– Me too!
96
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,300
Please be my teacher.
97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,540
Earlier, he was trying to
teach me something…
98
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,410
Excuse me… Please be my teacher.
99
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,590
Are you okay with me?
100
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Please teach me!
101
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,030
This is cool.
102
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,660
That’s too big!
103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,530
I’ll take this.
104
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,450
What’s your name?
105
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
I’m Matsuri.
106
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,650
Matsuri, choose a weapon.
107
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
What’s the matter?
108
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Come at me with that weapon
with the intent to kill me.
109
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,660
Yes, sir…
110
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,160
They say an ogre with Iron Club
is invincible. But you are no ogre.
111
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,870
Yes, sir. Please tell me
what I should choose.
112
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,980
The weapon called the Rope Javelin.
113
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,640
Rope Javelin…
114
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,990
The sharp blade on the end of the rope
115
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,520
is to keep an enemy out of one's reach,
rather than for attack.
116
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,060
And you seal off an enemy’s movement
with the rope.
117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,530
Practice until you can control it
as a part of your body.
118
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,870
Yes, sir!
119
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,100
Damn. Who are you guys?!
120
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,480
Is this all
the Sand Village Shinobi have?
121
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Wait.
122
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,620
Leave this guy alive.
We can use him to draw that one out.
123
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,330
Hang in there! What is it?!
What happened?
124
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,700
Take me to Gaara… Quickly.
125
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
What’s the matter?
126
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,330
My mother and father were hit with
countless weapons right in front of me.
127
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,400
So I…
128
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,640
For what purpose
do you hold a weapon?
129
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
He…
130
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,780
What are…
131
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,080
…these two to you?!
132
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,160
Th-These guys are…
133
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,060
…my friends!
134
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,390
Try laying so much as
another finger on them!
135
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,730
I’ll clobber you!
136
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,770
He said that to me.
137
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,740
That’s what we’re after: Gaara.
138
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,520
Gaara, we were
just coming to get you.
139
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,660
The patrol Ninja was
attacked by somebody.
140
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,560
Guys calling themselves
The Four Celestials
141
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,160
brandishing strange weapons,
said to tell Gaara that…
142
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,170
"We declare a challenge to you,
the ultimate weapon.
143
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,370
"If you don’t accept the challenge,
144
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,480
"we will take away one person
close to you every day…
145
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,650
"and they shall
pay the price for you."
146
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,790
You there.
147
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,060
Are you Gaara’s student?
148
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,070
You shall be the first sacrifice.
149
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,650
What’s this Rope Javelin?!
150
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
Wait!
151
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,730
The enemy went northeast…
152
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,900
Matsuri has become a first sacrifice…
153
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,900
But the real target of the guys who
call themselves the Four Celestials is…
154
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,400
you, Gaara.
155
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Yeah…
156
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,640
This must be brought to
a Jonin Council at once…
157
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,650
In the northeastern direction
158
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,620
where the ones who call themselves
the Four Celestials left,
159
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,790
there is the Village Hidden in the Leaves
of the Land of Fire,
160
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,660
with the Land of Rivers
sandwiched between.
161
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,490
Therefore, we will be requesting
the assistance of the Leaf…
162
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,230
Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.
163
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,530
Form a unit and prepare for
pursuit immediately.
164
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Hold it.
165
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,570
The enemy is after Gaara.
166
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,980
That would be like walking
right into a trap they laid.
167
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,210
That’s right.
Why won’t you send a party?!
168
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,120
It might be a diversionary tactic
by the enemy.
169
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,650
The village will become shorthanded
if we send out pursuers.
170
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,660
Then you at least could
come with us, right, Baki?!
171
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,030
Most likely, the enemy is
after Shukaku.
172
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,100
Gaara is the Sand’s ultimate weapon.
173
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,640
If we know that…
174
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,270
But it's also a dangerous
double-edged sword to the village.
175
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,450
If they would do us the favor
facing each other and perishing…
176
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,150
Then at least
I should go with them.
177
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,320
No. You have a different mission.
178
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,490
Just send those three!
179
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,700
Hey, how about it?!
180
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,640
I’ve been given
a different mission, you see…
181
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,640
Go. She’s your student, right?
182
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,280
Let’s go, Kankuro.
183
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,130
Will it be okay with her?!
184
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,960
She’s just a kid.
185
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,660
Will he come?!
186
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,440
If he doesn’t come, we’ll just sacrifice
those close to him one after another.
187
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,680
That is…?
188
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,450
It’s a message from the Sand Village!
189
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,660
Gaara? Why?
190
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,430
Who knows?
The goal is a challenge to Gaara.
191
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,200
The hostage is a Ninja school student.
192
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,570
The enemy is escaping in the direction of
the Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.
193
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,040
Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are
chasing after them.
194
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,810
At this point, that’s all we know.
195
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,840
You want me to set up an operation
to stop the overconfident jerks
196
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,850
who challenged Gaara
just with that information?
197
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,750
Yeah. We’re on friendly terms
with the Sand Village, so.
198
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,250
Just a minute.
199
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,290
They came during the Sasuke incident
with much less information than now.
200
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,660
Things are more bothersome
than that time!
201
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,200
Our range would widen significantly
if we ambushed them
202
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,830
instead of pursuing them.
203
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,840
There’s also the incident in question
in the Village of Artisans,
204
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,670
and the Jonin and Chunin
are all away…
205
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,010
– Shizune… 					– Yes, ma’am!
206
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,640
Those are the only Genin
we can use now.
207
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,350
Take the Genin you want to use
208
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,920
and leave the village
within thirty minutes!
209
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,190
Sakura’s name isn’t on here.
210
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,120
Yeah. She’s doing
Medical Ninjutsu training now, so.
211
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,660
I’ll accept the mission.
But I have one condition.
212
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,800
Please let me borrow Sakura.
213
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Sakura?
214
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,980
It’s almost time!
ls this everyone, Shikamaru?!
215
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,580
One person still hasn’t come.
216
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,650
Could that be…?
217
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,490
Sorry to keep you waiting!
218
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,660
I can’t do a mission hungry.
So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.
219
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,690
What?! That's not fair just you
getting to eat! I'll also…
220
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,660
All right! Now we’ve got
all our members together! We’re off!
221
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,830
Huh? What? This is it?!
222
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,500
I'd heard this was an operation
with a mobilization
223
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,670
of the Genin
remaining in the village!
224
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,070
This is everyone, I tell you!
225
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,640
That’s messed up!
226
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,810
Setting aside Sakura who’s training,
227
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,850
there should still be
Shino, Neji and Hinata!
228
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,450
No mistake. It’s weird Akamaru and I
being the only Ninja
229
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,950
with search ability.
230
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,860
So is this team
a go-for-it super attack-type?
231
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,660
Yeah. I name us
Team Return the Favor.
232
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,660
What lame naming!
233
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,900
The guys from the Sand Village
helped us during the Sasuke incident!
234
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,310
In a manner, this operation will be
returning the favor from that time!
235
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,810
All right! Guys, let’s make sure to
return the favor from that time.
236
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,350
You’re not the leader!
237
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,020
Shikamaru the Chunin is the leader
of this platoon, right?!
238
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,580
That’s right…
239
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,960
Jeez, then let’s settle on a strategy
and get going as soon as possible.
240
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,990
Are we going in one line
as we did for the Sasuke incident?
241
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,660
There’s no doubting the conditions
are similar to the Sasuke incident.
242
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,700
However, the strategies for pursuit
and ambush are completely different!
243
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,200
We can’t follow them with Byakugan
or by using Akamaru’s nose.
244
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,740
No mistake about that.
245
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,610
It’s unconventional, but since these are
all the people we’ve got,
246
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,280
we’ll act in groups of two basis
as Two-Man Cells.
247
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,220
Solo action is prohibited
no matter what the case!
248
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,920
We owe a debt to the Ninja in
the Sand Village.
249
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,660
However, although this is to repay a debt,
no way will we produce casualties!
250
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,990
Yeah, I got it.
251
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,670
– Follow me, Ino. 					– Right!
252
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,640
Choji, you go with Kiba…
253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,070
I’m counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.
254
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,310
Right…
255
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,640
Lee, you’re with Naruto…
256
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,050
Right. Please refrain
from selfish actions.
257
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,650
You don’t need to remind me like that.
258
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,190
Also, the four people Naruto mentioned
earlier have left before us.
259
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,660
Four people, do you mean
Shino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?
260
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,660
Yeah. The four will be
going their separate ways
261
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,060
and won’t take part in future battles!
262
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Why not?!
263
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,770
Isn’t that an incredible waste
of battle strength?!
264
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,540
In place of that, we get a wider range
of search action…
265
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,670
And we’ll have them focus on
medical action in the case of battle starting.
266
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,310
I have been entrusted with your lives
and this is my strategy!
267
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,280
All right, just wait, Gaara!
268
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,520
I’ll make sure to return the favor!
269
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,630
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
270
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,770
Will always be smiling right near by
271
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,640
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
272
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,280
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
273
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,190
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
274
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,020
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
275
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,000
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
276
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,370
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
277
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,700
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
278
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:15,210
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
279
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,080
The wind is probably testing our hearts
280
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,420
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
281
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,560
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
282
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,400
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
283
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,030
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
284
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,210
Will always be smiling right near by
285
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,590
One of the enemies uses wind, huh?
lnteresting. I will be her opponent!
286
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,120
Then I’ll take on the guy who brandishes
the sword that looks like a kid’s toy.
287
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,530
We’ll take care of this.
You go ahead, Gaara.
288
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,130
But, will it be okay?
289
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,000
We don’t need your help
to deal with these chumps.
290
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,570
You hurry, Gaara. That girl is
your student, isn’t she?
291
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,000
Next time: "Sand Alliance
with The Leaf Shinobi"
//%
1
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,980
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,190
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,350
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:53,060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,940
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:05,060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,560
Who’re you guys?
13
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,980
I’m in a bad mood right now.
14
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,400
If you wanna continue to fight,
15
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,520
I won't go easy on you.
16
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,150
You stop your babbling, weakling.
17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,230
Hey, come over here.
18
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,810
I’m gonna play
do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do on you…
19
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,020
while I snap your ribs!
20
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,100
I’ll do it!
21
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,350
What?! He got both of my legs
with his string…!
22
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,060
Why you--!
23
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,020
Humph! Let’s hear a nice sound.
24
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,980
Do!
25
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,730
W-What?!
26
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,480
Re!
27
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,600
Wh-Where is he attacking from?!
28
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,730
Your bones make
a really low sound, don’t they?
29
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,600
Let’s hear a much sharper reverberation,
shall we?
30
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,190
Right?
31
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,520
Next, I’ll go for
a mi-fa-so tri-combination.
32
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,100
Wha--?!
33
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,730
What?!
34
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,940
Last!
35
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,890
Lions Barrage!
36
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,520
An Invitation from the Sound
37
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,890
Here you are!
38
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
I’m digging in!
39
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,190
Sakura! Go on, eat, eat!
40
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,890
The Chinese-style barbecued pork
ramen noodles here are fabulous!
41
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,060
Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
42
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,560
Right, chef?
43
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,890
You’re gonna treat your girl.
44
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,900
You’re growing up, aren’t you, Naruto?
45
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,270
Wh-Wh-What?!
46
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,020
Wh-What the heck are
you talking about?
47
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,520
I need to have an important conversation
with Sakura today…
48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,890
Sh-She’s not my girl
or anything like that…
49
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,230
Sakura?
50
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,480
Sorry, Naruto. I was little spaced out.
51
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,900
This looks delicious.
52
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,350
Now then… Let’s eat! Let’s eat!
53
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,190
Yeah! Tell me about Sasuke
while we eat.
54
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,810
Sasuke told me not to tell you this,
Naruto, but…
55
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,150
It’s all that guy Orochimaru’s fault…
56
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,900
S-Stop!
57
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,520
Kakashi Sensei said it would be fine
and I’d like to believe that too…
58
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
But when he was battling Gaara…
59
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,520
Earlier today…
60
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,890
Sasuke was wearing the same expression
as the time before.
61
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,900
That’s why I…
62
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,480
Orochimaru, huh?
I ran into him again a little while back.
63
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,600
Really? Where?!
64
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,270
When I was searching for
Old Lady Tsunade…
65
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,890
Die!
66
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,940
Shoot!
67
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,690
Pervy Sage and the old lady…
68
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,440
Despite the fact that
he was fighting two of them at once,
69
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,060
he was incredibly powerful.
70
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,690
He’s one dangerous dude.
71
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,150
That strong…
72
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,060
It’ll all be fine, believe it!
73
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,190
Sasuke wouldn’t fall to
that kind of guy’s enticement.
74
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,060
He’s already a really powerful guy,
75
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,310
so he wouldn’t need to do
that kind of thing!
76
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,940
I guarantee it!
77
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,270
Yeah!
78
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,890
Why does Master Orochimaru
want this guy anyway?
79
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,850
Kimimaro would have
been much better…
80
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,690
Well, if you stay in
a seedy place like this,
81
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,560
you’ll just remain mediocre at best.
82
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,020
You’ll never become strong…
83
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,230
Wh-Why…?
84
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,350
All my barrages were solid.
Yet this guy…
85
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
doesn't seem to have
sustained any damage.
86
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,890
If you keep on fooling around
playing Ninja with your friends,
87
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,100
you’re just gonna continue to rot.
88
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,730
Come with us.
89
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,400
If you do,
Master Orochimaru will empower you.
90
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,650
There’s no meaning
if we take you by force, he said.
91
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,690
You decide.
92
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,440
Gimme a break…
93
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,770
Master Orochimaru sure sent me
on a bothersome mission.
94
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,890
Hey! What did you decide?
95
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,480
Are you coming?
96
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,600
Or are you not coming?!
97
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,560
Decide already!
98
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,350
When a weakling like you lags,
99
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,940
it makes me wanna just finish you!
100
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,230
Try me…!
101
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,770
You…those Curse Marks…
102
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,980
Don’t be so sure that
103
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,150
you’re the only favorite
of Master Orochimaru.
104
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,690
One shouldn’t use Curse Marks
that lightly.
105
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,810
Or rather…it looks like you’re not
even able to control the Curse Marks.
106
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,560
If they continue to be released
for a long period of time,
107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
Curse Marks will progressively
eat your body.
108
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,810
It looks like you’re still at first state,
109
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,940
so the speed at which they will
eat away at you is still fairly slow.
110
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,770
But when they have entirely eaten you,
111
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,230
you will lose yourself.
112
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,020
Forever.
113
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,690
In exchange for having been
empowered by Curse Marks,
114
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,850
you will be tethered
by Master Orochimaru.
115
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,350
We no longer have anything
like freedom.
116
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,890
In order to receive something,
one must discard something.
117
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,520
What is your objective?
118
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,100
Are you and your comrades
just going to comfort each other
119
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,890
in this lukewarm village…
120
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,020
then simply forget all about…
121
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,690
Itachi Uchiha?
122
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,890
Don’t forget your objective.
123
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,150
This kind of village does
nothing more than shackle you!
124
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,150
Cut your stupid ties with this place.
125
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,440
If you do that, you’ll…
126
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,480
be able to obtain much,
more fabulous power.
127
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,900
Don’t forget your objective!
128
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,150
Thanks!
129
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,890
H-Hey Sakura.
130
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,400
I’ll walk you home!
131
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,890
Huh? Don’t worry about it.
132
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,350
Why, why?
The streets are dangerous at night!
133
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,850
They’re well lit, so I’ll be fine…
134
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,400
Sakura?
135
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,890
Thanks, Naruto.
136
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,890
But I want to go home alone tonight.
137
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,810
I see…
138
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
I’ll be fine!
139
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,890
Yeah!
140
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,350
Why are you hanging around in a place
like this in the middle of the night?
141
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,890
One has to pass down this road
to leave the village.
142
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,190
Go home and sleep.
143
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,980
Why…
144
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,770
Why won’t you tell me anything?
145
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,600
Why are you always silent like that?
146
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,480
You won’t tell me one single thing.
147
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,730
Why should I have to tell you anything?!
148
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,730
I’m telling you to keep your nose
out of my business.
149
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,400
Stop bothering me
over everything I do.
150
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,650
I…make you dislike me
all the time, don’t I?
151
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,730
Do you remember?
152
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,100
We just became Genin and
the Three-Man Squads were assigned…
153
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,770
You and I were alone for
the first time, here at this very spot.
154
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,890
You got mad at me.
155
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,190
See! That guy doesn’t
have parents, right?
156
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,400
He’s all alone and he doesn’t have to deal
with parents lecturing him…
157
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,890
That’s why he can sometimes
be selfish!
158
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,100
Solitude…
159
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,190
Huh?
160
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,890
Isn’t the same as being scolded
by one’s parents.
161
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,440
What’s the matter all of a sudden….
162
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,150
You…are annoying…
163
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,520
I don’t remember that.
164
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,890
Yeah, I guess…
that was long ago, after all…
165
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,400
But it all began that day.
166
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,560
Sasuke and me…
167
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,890
And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei…
168
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,270
The four of us went
on various missions, didn’t we?
169
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,940
Those were tough and
difficult times, but…
170
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,650
But…
171
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,480
more than anything…
172
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,890
it was so much fun!
173
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,770
I know about your family, Sasuke…
174
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,690
But revenge…
175
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,770
that won’t bring anyone happiness.
176
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,270
No one…
177
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,150
Neither you…
178
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,890
nor I.
179
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,890
As I expected…
180
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,890
I’m different from you guys…
181
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,350
I’m walking a road that’s incompatible
with the rest of you.
182
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,940
The four of us worked together…
183
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,600
and it’s true that there was a time
when I thought that was my road.
184
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,650
The four of us have worked together,
185
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,060
but in the end,
I decided on revenge.
186
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,600
That’s been my reason for living.
187
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,810
I can’t become like
you and Naruto.
188
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,890
Are you going to isolate
yourself again, Sasuke?!
189
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,890
You taught me that solitude
is a very rough thing that time, Sasuke!
190
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,980
Now I know exactly how that feels.
191
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,890
I have both family and friends…
192
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,400
But if you were no longer here, Sasuke…
193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,400
for me…
194
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,400
for me it would be the same as solitude.
195
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,150
From here again…
196
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,400
we’re going to start walking
our new paths individually.
197
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,350
I…!
198
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,060
I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!
199
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,600
If you would only be with me, Sasuke,
200
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,770
I won't let you regret it,
no matter what!
201
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,900
I’ll make it fun every day and
you will definitely find happiness!
202
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,940
I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke!
203
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,150
So…I’m begging you,
please stay here!
204
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,980
I’ll even help you with your revenge!
205
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,310
I’ll make it happen somehow,
I promise you…!
206
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,400
So stay here…with me…!
207
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,850
If that doesn’t work for you…
208
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,440
Then take me with you…
209
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,270
You really are…annoying.
210
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,190
Don’t go!
211
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,890
If you go, I’ll scream and…
212
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,440
Sakura…
213
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,890
Thank you…
214
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,560
Sasuke…
215
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,890
We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke.
216
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,100
What’s your intention?
217
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,890
It was already decided that
you would be our leader
218
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,020
the moment you exited the village.
219
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,890
Please forgive our rudeness
up to now.
220
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,890
I don’t care about any of that.
221
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,100
Let’s go.
222
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,400
This is the beginning!
223
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:32,890
Once in a long while, once in a while
224
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:38,480
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
225
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,770
Look like a mountain
226
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,900
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
227
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,650
The remnants of a person crying
228
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,690
Look like a mountain
229
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,350
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
230
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,190
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
231
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,520
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
232
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,770
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
233
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,890
Look like a mountain
234
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,100
Look like a mountain
235
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,850
Look like a mountain
236
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,940
Look like a mountain
237
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,480
What? That jerk Sasuke.
238
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,020
What the heck is he thinking?
He has such a twisted personality!
239
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,890
What is it that he disliked so much
that he'd do something like this?!
240
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,560
Damn! I'm not about to let that guy
do whatever he wants!
241
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,600
If things come to this, I'll chase him
down to the end of the world.
242
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,100
I'll drag that guy back
even if I have to grab him by his neck!
243
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,150
Next time:
"Formation! The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!"
//%
1
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,980
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,190
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,350
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:53,060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,940
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,980
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,480
Where’s the other one?
13
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,020
Hey…
14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,890
Who are you looking for?
15
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,350
I’ll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.
16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,730
This is my ability…
specializing in assassination, of course.
17
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,480
You can’t beat me by just having
a good nose and nails…
18
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,270
You can’t beat my ability!
19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,560
Akamaru… I’m sorry…
20
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,440
Akamaru…
We’ve always done things together.
21
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,730
We were together
whenever and wherever.
22
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,400
However this one time, I’m sunk.
23
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,810
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,
24
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,600
and I can even create parts
that are only you.
25
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,400
In other words,
a little bit of a fusion condition…
26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,890
a sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.
27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,380
A sharing…?
28
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,890
That’s right!
29
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,270
And a cruel way of killing
that only I can accomplish…
30
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,900
the gradual scraping off
of just your cells!
31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,810
I see…
32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
If that’s the case…!
33
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,890
If I do this…
what’s gonna happen?
34
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,900
Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!
35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,940
Die with me…
36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,150
To Each His Own Battle
37
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,480
What are you thinking?!
38
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,810
It’s just as I thought…
We are sharing one body, right?
39
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,060
Damn it!
40
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,350
Entering my opponent’s body
to avoid any attacks…
41
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,690
that is my Jutsu’s greatest advantage.
42
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,100
There hasn’t been
a single one before now
43
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,650
who’s done this sort of thing.
44
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,350
Are you in pain?
45
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,560
All right then, let’s get comfortable now.
46
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,890
Yikes, you idiot! 					Stop it!
47
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,440
It’s too late!
48
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,480
There’s not enough blood…
49
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,060
Damn!
50
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,890
Damn…
51
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,400
Where’d he go?
52
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,190
So he left his little dog behind
and fled.
53
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,890
It’s the right decision,
but he’s more cold-hearted than me.
54
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,400
What?!
55
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,890
It couldn’t be!
56
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,190
What a relief…
He’s still breathing.
57
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,810
What a relief!
58
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,900
Akamaru… You really gave it your best.
59
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,310
Because of you, I was able to hold up
the enemy for a while.
60
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,690
We’ve caused injuries
upon the enemy too.
61
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,190
It’s enough… You’ve done enough.
62
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,480
His name is Akamaru.
63
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,270
Huh?
64
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Mom… Sis…
65
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,900
From today, you’ll take care of him…
Okay?
66
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,100
I will?
67
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,400
I’m Kiba. Nice to meet you, Akamaru.
68
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,890
You!
69
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,890
We’ve been together forever.
70
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,650
Nice catch, Akamaru!
71
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,890
All right, you did well!
72
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,020
Here we go!
73
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,480
Be more serious about it!
74
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,890
Stop being such a baby!
75
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,350
Mom…
76
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,980
Listen, Kiba…
77
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,850
It’s not just you.
78
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,310
Akamaru and you,
79
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,520
the two of you need
to become strong together.
80
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,810
With Akamaru… Together?
81
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,560
Akamaru…
82
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,150
That’s right.
83
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,060
Way to go Akamaru! You did it!
84
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,600
Mid-air Dynamic Marking!
85
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,100
Next is mid-air triple somersault!
Take your aim!
86
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,890
Yahoo!
87
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,100
Yahoo!
88
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,600
We’ll be together forever
from now on too…
89
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,850
I’ll protect you from now on!
90
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,690
That jerk!
91
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,890
Setting up a trap on me!
92
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,980
I’ll kill you!
93
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,980
Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!
94
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,520
Sakon!
95
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,730
Sakon!
96
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,890
Blah blah blah.
You’re such a nuisance, Big Brother.
97
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,890
Your yelling stings my eyes…
98
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,440
Big Brother!
99
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,900
I’ll kill him… is what I’d like to do,
100
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,890
but it’s almost time for my sleep.
101
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,890
Capture those bastards alive in my place.
102
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,520
When I wake up,
I’ll kill them.
103
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,100
All right, Sakon?
Capture them alive…
104
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,440
Yeah, I got it…
105
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,890
But…
106
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,890
The killing part,
we’ll do it together.
107
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,190
If I carelessly attack,
108
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,560
he dodges
and I end up attacking myself!
109
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,770
Behold!
110
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,270
Willow Dance!
111
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,480
You!
112
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,230
Bones?
113
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,770
This is my…Kekkei Genkai.
114
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,810
What’s with this guy…?
115
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,400
Is he attacking with bones sticking out
from all over his body?
116
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,770
He’s grabbed his own bone!
117
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,150
It’ll be soon…
118
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,150
He’s turning the bone…
into a sword!
119
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,890
It’s futile. It’s not just ordinary bone.
120
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,350
The highest density bone is hard as steel.
121
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,890
So what?! I’ll break that bone!
122
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,020
I possess Five Dances.
123
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,480
You’d better not think
you know my strength after just this much.
124
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,480
What?!
125
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,190
I’ll specially show you…
126
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,400
the Camellia Dance next .
127
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,600
Come!
128
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,100
I’ll crush you!
129
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,940
I did it!
130
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,560
It’s a Substitution?!
131
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
There!
132
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,310
Damn!
133
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,060
They’re getting closer and closer.
134
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,650
Damn!
135
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,520
This isn’t good, traces of blood!
136
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,480
Damn, I did save Akamaru
for the time being,
137
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,600
but maybe I went too far.
138
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,890
This smell…
What does it mean?
139
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,690
Why… Why is it that even those guys
are headed to a place like this?!
140
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,270
I don’t understand anymore.
141
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,810
In any case,
we need to leave this place quickly.
142
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,940
I can’t…
143
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,060
I’m starting to feel light-headed
from the pain and loss of blood…
144
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,650
My body won’t move at all either…
145
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,890
Akamaru…
146
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,890
He left just his coat…
147
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,890
Huh?
148
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,890
So he fled by floating down the river…
149
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,940
Damn!
150
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,890
Damn!
151
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,810
Damn…
152
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,890
This is it!
153
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,890
So, I’ve cornered you, you stinking rat!
154
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,890
Pretty impressive…
155
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,520
You timed it well to scatter
the three to attack.
156
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,310
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
157
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,850
Since it’s a pretty complicated song…
158
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,520
Well now…
159
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,890
Not only did you
immediately understand
160
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,520
that I’m manipulating these guys
with my flute,
161
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,150
you understood how difficult this song is.
You’re a pretty impressive punk.
162
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,980
But you can’t completely
understand this song.
163
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,270
You're so right…
since art is so foreign to me.
164
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,770
But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,
165
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,940
it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns
166
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,520
to control each and every movement
of those guys.
167
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,900
I’m pretty confident
when it comes to just analyzing,
168
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,230
but this time it’s not looking good.
169
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,520
The reason is that
170
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,690
I don’t understand
musical notes whatsoever.
171
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,730
There’s no one that’s heard
this song and lived.
172
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,850
Finale, Ninth Passage,
Demon Revolution!
173
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,730
The melody’s changed!
174
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,060
For the first time, I spoke to you
175
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,190
And you smiled
176
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,850
For the first time, I was able to speak
177
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,600
In my own words
178
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,150
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
179
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,810
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
180
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,400
My clumsy attempts with words
181
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,060
You listened without turning away
182
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,350
No wonder I get carried away by you
183
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:11,440
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
184
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,690
I feel so sad
185
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,650
But…
186
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,980
For the first time, I spoke to you
187
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,020
And you smiled
188
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,890
For the first time, I was able to speak
189
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,890
In my own words
190
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,400
For the first time, I spoke to you
191
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,650
And you smiled
192
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,060
For the first time, I was able to speak
193
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,020
In my own words
194
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,810
For the first time, I spoke to you
195
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,890
Attacks and defense without gaps
using three Summoned bodies.
196
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,060
I hate to admit, but she may
be a pretty good Shogi player.
197
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,270
Plus I don’t have much Ninja tools left…
198
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,890
Man, it feels like I’m playing
without rooks or bishops.
199
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,810
Now then…shall I go?
200
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,730
Cry or laugh,
I can only give it my all here!
201
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,560
Next time,
“Fakeout: Shikamaru’s Comeback!”
//%
1
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,600
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,590
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,140
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,640
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,390
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:46,260
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:55,590
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:06,510
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:15,850
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,010
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,180
Look, Papa!
12
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,600
What is it, Kunihisa?
13
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,930
Look, it’s sparkly and pretty.
14
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,600
That’s right, Kunihisa.
15
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,590
Even though it’s so pretty,
how can it have no value…
16
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,590
That’s horrible, isn’t it, Papa?
17
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,800
Impossible!
Celebirty Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!
18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,100
A-Are you serious, Grandma Tsunade!
19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,590
Calm down!
20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,100
Sorry, I’ll calm down.
21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,510
Since he is an important person,
22
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,590
I believe there is no one appropriate
for the job other than you.
23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Finally… Finally a mission
appropriate for my abilities.
24
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,590
Guarding an important person…
lt has such a nice ring to it!
25
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,510
Listen seriously!
26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Gotcha.
27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,850
Okay, about this mission…
28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,590
Shizune.
29
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,260
Yes!
30
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,680
The details are written in
those documents.
31
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,260
His name’s Kunihisa,
he lives in the capital.
32
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,590
He’s the heir of
an old acquaintance of mine.
33
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,760
Your acquaintance, Grandma Tsunade?
34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,590
Yes, his father’s name is Kunijiro.
35
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,970
He made his fortune in one generation.
He’s a successful jeweler.
36
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,970
The heir of a jeweler…
37
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,970
Hey, Papa?
38
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,680
Is this real, too?
39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,680
Of course it’s real, little Kuni.
40
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,050
So, is that and that and this
and the one over there too?!
41
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,180
Of course, little Kuni!
42
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,050
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,640
Suddenly my motivation is boosted!
44
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,010
I’ll do it! I’ll do that mission!
45
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,930
So where is this Kunihisa at,
Grandma Tsunade?!
46
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,970
Come in!
47
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,010
– Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
– Wow! What’s this brat?
48
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,350
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,590
Ninja?
50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,010
Don’t add that question mark at
the end of your sentence, don’t!
51
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,590
So it must be you!
52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,590
You are the kid who’s going with Kunihisa
to play be a-Ninja-for-a-day…
53
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,220
I’ll leave him to you, then.
54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,100
What? Be a Ninja for a day…?
55
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,590
My little Kuni really admires Ninja,
56
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,640
and he aggravates me by saying
nothing but Ninja everyday.
57
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,350
Grandma Tsunade!
58
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,590
Wasn’t this
the guarding-important-person mission?!
59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
What are you talking about?
60
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,600
I did say he’s an important person,
61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
but didn’t say a word about
guarding him.
62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,590
I was fooled! Grandma!
63
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,590
Naruto Uzumaki!
64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,590
I order you to play be
a-Ninja-for-a-day with Kunihisa!
65
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,800
Damn… That’s a dirty trick, Grandma!
66
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,590
Oh, there’s one more thing.
67
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,470
I added your regular missions
as a service.
68
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,590
Oh, that’s cruel, Grandma Tsunade!
69
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,760
Clean the pond, repair the bridge,
get rid of the savage pig,
70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,800
and…
71
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,100
It turns out that babysitting is just added
to the regular D-rank missions!
72
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,640
Ninja, Ninja.
73
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,760
Watch this, Kunihisa!
74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,390
I’ll teach you the awesomeness
of a Ninja.
75
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,850
Hey, awesome Naruto! Awesome!
76
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,600
It’s “be-a-Ninja-for-a-day,” isn’t it?
77
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,590
So Kunihisa, you gather garbage
from over there, too.
78
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay!
79
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,470
Oh, that’s right.
Don’t go into the marsh.
80
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,220
This marsh is bottomless,
81
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,760
so once you’re caught,
you can’t get out.
82
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,590
Huh, what?
83
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,140
– Oh, no, Young Master is in trouble!
– Naruto!
84
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,010
What are you doing?!
85
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,550
You fool! I’ll save you,
so you stay right there!
86
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,930
Fool! I’ll be fine.
87
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,300
You’ll be fine?
88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I can handle this kind of simple task
with my Ninjutsu.
89
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,640
Ninjutsu?
90
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,430
– Oh no! Young Master!
– Oh, no!
91
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,260
Alligator snapping turtle, Piranha, Toad!
92
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,720
Money Style:
93
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,260
Help Me Jutsu!
94
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,590
What?!
95
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,550
– Yay! 					– Mine!
96
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,680
Wha--?! Wh-Wh-Wha--?!
97
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,010
I’m fine!
98
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,760
What are you guys doing?!
99
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,590
If you want money hurry up
and rescue me.
100
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,850
What good would increasing
the victims do?
101
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,590
Hey, Kunihisa.
102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,390
Huh?
103
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,680
Who are they?
104
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,300
Oh, them…
105
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,300
Papa employs them and
they protect me if I get into trouble.
106
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,350
Really.
107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,760
That’s right, for example…
108
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,140
There!
109
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,590
See!
110
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,890
What do you mean “see”?!
111
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,850
Is it okay?
112
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,970
I said it’s okay!
113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,890
Really, really okay?
114
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,970
What are you so freaked out about?
lt’s okay!
115
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,590
But still, it’s scary!
116
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,640
Cut the bull and come here now!
117
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,590
R-Right!
118
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,140
But just before that…
119
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,100
Ninja Art: Scapegoat Jutsu!
120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,470
See? It’s fine.
C’mere, quick!
121
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,220
If I get on it next,
I think it might break…
122
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,890
Let’s check out a bunch more.
123
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,430
I’m not finished yet! More of you!
124
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,680
Go!
125
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,010
What the--?!
126
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,010
Just as I thought.
127
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,430
I thought I was gonna die.
128
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,800
What were you doing, Kunihisa?!
129
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,590
What would have happened if
I’d got on the bridge like that?
130
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,930
C’mon you!
131
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,350
Okay everyone, your compensation!
132
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,590
Here!
133
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,640
I’m telling you, stop that!
134
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,720
That kid…
He’s got money, huh, Big Brother.
135
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,180
Yeah… And his main guard
is a single Genin.
136
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,430
Big Brother, it’s decided.
137
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,600
Yeah.
138
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,720
What’s next?
139
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,590
Get rid of the savage pig
who appears in the field ahead.
140
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,140
Okay! I’ll do my best!
141
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,300
What the--?!
142
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,760
A savage pig…?
143
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,890
More like a monster!
144
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,930
Crap!
145
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,590
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
146
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,890
That’s cool!
147
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,590
Naruto!
148
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,260
Okay! It’s my turn this time!
149
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,760
F-Fool! What are you doing?
Hurry up and escape!
150
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,970
Here I go!
151
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,010
Ninja Art: Money Clone Jutsu!
152
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,590
Money Clone?!
153
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,010
Huh?!
154
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,590
Hey, you ugly savage pig!
155
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,970
Starting now,
I, Kunihisa, will punish you!
156
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,470
Go!
157
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,510
Go! Get him! There!
158
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,510
What, nobody wants to eat your meat!
You dummy!
159
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,850
He ordered all of this!
160
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,590
What?!
161
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,590
I didn’t want to,
but he forced me to…
162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,850
Huh? W-Wait…
163
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,180
That’s a lie. It’s a misunderstanding!
164
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,590
Those are false charges!
165
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,850
Forgive me! Naruto…
166
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,260
I… How should I put this…?
167
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,390
really hate guys like you!
168
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,430
Why are you getting so testy?
169
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,680
Geez, poor people just can’t help
that they have short tempers…
170
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,010
This’ll put you back in a good mood.
171
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,760
Take as much as you want!
172
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,010
Enough already!
173
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,010
I’m telling you to stop
doing stuff like that!
174
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,100
Why?
175
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,100
It’s a big mistake to think that
anything can be resolved with money!
176
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,390
There are times when you have
to use your own power!
177
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,640
There hasn’t been anything that
I couldn’t do with money so far!
178
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,970
You… Are you always like this?
179
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,600
With that personality,
you can’t make friends!
180
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,430
It’s okay ‘cause
I can buy friends with money!
181
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,590
What…?
182
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,350
You… Buy friends? You mean…
183
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,850
If I give ‘em money,
everybody will be my friend!
184
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,140
Kunihisa…
185
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,890
That’s why I hate country Ninjas.
186
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,050
They’re cheap and stink of poverty…
187
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,390
Stupid!
188
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,550
Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa!
189
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,100
Running made me hungry.
190
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,970
Take this and buy a boxed lunch!
191
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,600
There’s nothing like a store
to buy lunch around here.
192
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,680
Well, snacks will be fine!
193
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,590
There’s no convenient store
or candy shop…
194
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,890
You’re useless!
This is why I hate the country!
195
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,590
Stupid Naruto.
196
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,220
What’s that?
197
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,590
Oh, Young Master!
198
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,590
Oh!
199
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,430
Little fish, little fish!
200
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,850
Let’s eat!
201
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,100
The kid must be stupid to get
caught in this cheap trick.
202
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,100
Don’t you agree, Bro?
203
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,970
Yeah!
204
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,850
Huh? Naruto?!
205
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,180
Aw man,
you’re really high maintenance.
206
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,600
Those two guys just now…
207
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
They were going to catch you!
208
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,470
They were plotting a kidnapping, whatever…
209
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,590
Whatever…?
210
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,050
I’m often a target,
because I have money.
211
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,590
Often a target…? You…
212
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,300
More importantly,
I want to eat more fish!
213
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,300
Go find a shop and buy some.
214
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,550
You… Still think you can do
anything with money?
215
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,590
All right, watch this!
216
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,970
Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto!
217
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,590
How’s that?!
218
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,300
You can just get things using
your own power without using money.
219
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,590
Even… without using money?
220
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,720
Damn!
221
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,590
He attacked us by surprise,
that cowardly bastard.
222
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,600
I’ll give it back to him doubled!
223
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,430
Well, wait…
224
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,220
If we do it thoughtlessly,
we’ll just get creamed again.
225
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,100
So what do we do?
226
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,640
We’ll use that thing.
227
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,720
That thing…?
228
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,590
Look close at the movement
of the fish…
229
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,590
Aim for the instant when
they fall after jumping up.
230
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Don’t get hasty.
231
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,430
Now!
232
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,140
Oh!
233
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,140
That was close!
234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,510
O-One more time, Naruto!
235
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,970
I’ll get the Kunai knife,
so one more time!
236
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Master Kunihisa!
237
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,550
– It’s deep over there!
– Please be careful!
238
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,590
I know, I know…
239
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,970
Where did it go?
240
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,430
I think it’s in this area, but…
241
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,470
I won’t let you get away this time!
242
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,590
You guys…
243
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,720
We hired these guys with
the money you threw away.
244
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,800
It means that now,
they’re on our side…
245
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,720
Hey, you guys! I’ll pay you double
what those guys did!
246
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,590
So be on my side…
247
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,720
Wh-What the…?
248
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,430
Looks like you’ve run out of money.
249
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,890
How about you guys over there?
Wanna join us?
250
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,010
We’ll pay up stacks of money.
251
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,510
Humph! These guys have been
with me for a long time.
252
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,890
That paltry sum won’t…
253
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,970
We’re not going along with
your selfish acts any longer!
254
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,680
Y-You guys?!
255
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,680
No! I don’t like it!
256
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,590
Annoying brat. I’ll have to tie you up
so you won’t move.
257
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,010
What are you doing, Kunihisa?!
258
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,720
Naruto, I… I…
259
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
It’s fine already!
260
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,100
Hey you… I’ll pay you double what
you get for your mission.
261
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,140
Won’t you hand that brat over to us?
262
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,550
We’re just going to demand
ransom money from his parents is all.
263
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,260
We won’t kill him.
Relax and hand him over.
264
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,760
I-It’s not enough?
Here, how about this?
265
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,430
Naruto…
266
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,590
Kunihisa! Ride on my back!
267
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,850
O-Okay.
268
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,050
S-Still not enough, huh? Here!
That’s all of it! Take it!
269
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,140
Like I said…
270
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,890
It’s a big mistake to think
you can obtain anything with money!
271
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,590
Crap!
272
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,970
After them!
273
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,590
Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa.
274
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,470
Okay!
275
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,680
Damn! I can’t move
with him on my back!
276
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,680
I can’t see the bottom, Naruto…
277
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,260
Go!
278
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,800
Okay! You go on ahead.
279
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,590
What?! Go on ahead?!
280
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,180
There he is! Let’s get him!
281
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,260
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
282
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,930
Wh-What are you doing?!
283
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,590
It’s okay! Hurry up and jump!
284
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,180
I-I can’t… I’m scared, Naruto!
285
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,220
It’s not scary, c’mon!
286
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,890
I can’t… I’m scared…!
287
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,800
Damn it!
288
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,760
Do it!
289
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Naruto!
290
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,590
Well, you’re coming with me!
291
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,930
Hurry! Kunihisa!
292
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,890
B-But……
293
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,510
It’s okay… You can definitely do this!
Believe it!
294
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,970
Prepare yourself!
295
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,850
No way!
296
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,470
Go Kunihisa!
297
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,140
Oh, Big Brother!
298
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,350
Huh?! Kunihisa?!
299
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,390
It hurts!
300
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I’m going to clean those guys out
and then I’ll be right over!
301
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,930
So wait a second!
302
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,100
D-Daruto…
303
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,300
D-Darudo!
304
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,180
The wall’s collapsing… Escape!
305
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,470
How long are you guys gonna be
on top of me!
306
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,010
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
307
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,590
Wh-Wh-What’s going on?!
308
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,590
I have to go to him!
309
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,050
There are times when you have
to use your own power!
310
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,760
Use my own…power!
311
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,390
You can just get things using
your own power with out using money.
312
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,050
Even without money…
313
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,470
with my own power!
314
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,720
I can…do this!
315
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,720
Just one step short!
316
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,800
Naruto!
317
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,760
Kunihisa!
318
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,010
No! A little bit more!
319
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,140
– We did it! 					– We did it!
320
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,590
All right!
321
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,600
I-It hurts but…
I’m scared but…
322
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,350
I…!
323
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,470
You… What a face?!
324
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,800
Kunihisa…
325
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,640
You did a good job!
326
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,590
Darudo!
327
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,590
Wha--?!
Hold on, don’t drip snot!
328
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,800
But Naruto!
329
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,590
Stop it!
330
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,760
Well… See ya!
331
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,350
Yeah! Next time you come play
at my house, Naruto!
332
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,930
Okay!
333
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,390
Really… You took great care of him.
Thank you!
334
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,470
Yeah, well…
335
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,890
Well then…
336
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,590
Yes…
337
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,760
Papa, Papa!
338
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,590
What is it, little Kuni?
339
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,430
Look, it’s sparkly and pretty…
340
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,720
But it has no value,
it’s just a marble, little Kuni.
341
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,550
That’s true, Papa…
342
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,180
But…
343
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,590
As long as it's pretty, it doesn't matter
whether it's valueless, right?
344
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,220
The wind blows, Ah…
345
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,970
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
346
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,590
What should be brought along?
347
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,590
Assemble them into a piece.
348
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,590
There is no second chance, never
349
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,260
How foolish it is to throw away
350
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
351
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,430
The images.
352
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,510
It probably will not end
353
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,760
It probably will not end
354
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,590
Burn that love-filled heart,
355
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,600
Sail across a thousand dreams
356
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,640
Running freely
357
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,430
To take hold of the world in hand
358
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,550
The clouds scatter
359
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,510
The sun sets yet again
360
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,010
The solo parade begins to move.
361
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,350
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
362
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,720
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
363
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,260
All right, I’m fired up!
Our mission this time is a treasure hunt!
364
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,050
But your recent low mission
success rate concerns me.
365
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,180
No need to worry.
We’ve got a map, so it’ll be a cinch!
366
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,260
I’ve thought about it, you see…
367
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,930
No need to think, believe it!
368
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,600
If you fail this mission…
369
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,050
It’ll be okay, I tell you!
370
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,640
You’ll all start over again
from the Academy!
371
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,300
What?!
372
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,050
Next time: "The Treasure Hunt is On!"
//%
1
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,490
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,370
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,910
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,490
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,160
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:46,040
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:55,490
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:06,290
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:15,620
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,790
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,580
Hmm, what?
12
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,700
A wanted flyer.
13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,490
"This man who calls himself
Tokichi is a major criminal
14
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,490
who has killed a family of three…"
15
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,330
"He has a bird-shaped birthmark
on his chest."
16
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,700
A bird-shaped birthmark…?
lt couldn’t be…
17
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,910
What is it, Hinata?
18
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,870
I can’t tell because
his face is covered with scars.
19
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,500
But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark.
20
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,490
He has a bounty on his head too?
21
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,410
What the heck is going on
with everything?
22
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,910
Hunt or Be Hunted?!
Showdown at the OK Temple
23
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,490
Where are you going, old man?
24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,870
Just rest quietly.
25
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,790
Let go!
26
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,200
Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mine…
27
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,200
What the heck can you do in that condition,
you wanted man?!
28
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,490
A bounty hunter who was
in the bar attacked last night…
29
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,490
What’s the idea of a bounty
chasing after a bounty?
30
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,950
It’s none of your concern!
31
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,830
Your wound again…
32
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,490
Stop!
33
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,490
D-Don’t move!
34
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,160
I didn’t do it…
35
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,870
Then, how do you explain
this wanted flyer?
36
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,790
That Gosunkugi did it…
37
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,120
He killed an innocent family
of three…
38
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,410
just to steal money.
39
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,790
What do you mean by that?
40
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,450
I was a swordsmith in a tiny village…
41
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,830
in a small country sandwiched
between two large countries.
42
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,120
I was poor,
but for me it was a happy life.
43
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,250
But on that festival day…
44
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,250
I was about to go deliver a sword
that a customer had ordered.
45
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,120
I wanted to participate in the festival
right away, so I was hurrying.
46
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,490
At that very moment…
47
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,490
For some reason,
the door was half open.
48
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,950
It’s Tokichi…
I’m delivering the sword you ordered…
49
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,830
I told everyone everything
as it happened.
50
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,580
But…the people in the village
wouldn’t believe me.
51
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,080
It’s because I was the only one
who hadn’t shown up at the festival.
52
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,490
And the particular shape of the sword
that stabbed through the family…
53
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,040
A swordsmith should be able
to make any kind of weapon…
54
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,700
That was the reason.
55
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,540
Stand up, Tokichi!
56
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,870
Tokichi!
57
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,700
Don’t let him get away! After him!
58
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,620
And ever since…
59
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,490
I wandered aimlessly from town to town.
60
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,290
BOUNTY
One million ryo
61
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,490
It was something
the villagers had issued.
62
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,870
And there was one more
wanted flyer besides mine…
63
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,330
BOUNTY 					Threee million yen
64
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,580
…of the man who killed the family.
65
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,000
I resolved to capture Gosunkugi
with my own hands.
66
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,700
I would clear my name and
return to my village…
67
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,040
And…to get some information about him,
if even just a little…
68
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,500
I became a bounty hunter despite
having a price on my own head.
69
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,950
So that’s why we were in the way, huh?
70
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,410
The only way to prove my innocence
is for me to capture him myself.
71
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,490
I want to go home.
72
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,490
Will you…concede him to me?
73
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
We’re Ninja.
74
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,490
We carry out missions we’ve received,
no matter what!
75
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,660
Even if the worst were to happen,
we can’t let him get away.
76
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,490
Let’s go…
77
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,490
Was that okay, Naruto?
78
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,290
That Gosunkugi jerk!
79
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,910
We have to capture him,
no matter what.
80
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,700
That’s right.
81
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,790
And if that old man, Sazanami,
pushes it too far in his condition,
82
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,040
not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi,
he could end up getting killed instead.
83
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,080
Don’t hold back.
I’ll give you…
84
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,490
the likes of my head.
85
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,120
You’re wounded,
so I can kill you whenever I want.
86
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,700
Before that, I’ll be taking Gosunkugi.
87
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,410
Well, I guess I’ll just have
those Shinobi kids do their best.
88
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,250
The Land of Stone,
Post Station Two…
89
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,620
It seems everything in this town…
90
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,290
politics, economics, military,
is conducted by monks.
91
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,410
It really is. Nothing but temples…
92
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,040
The temple, which could be
called the head temple,
93
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,870
is the OK Temple on that mountain.
94
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,160
Hey, Hinata. What’s that bell?
95
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,490
That was created as
the sightseeing crown jewel
96
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,490
to recruit people to live in their temple…
The Golden Bell!
97
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,120
It’s just like it is saying,
“Please steal me.”
98
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,000
I know…
Gosunkugi is after that bell!
99
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,080
– Yeah. 					– Yeah.
100
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,250
But how does that Gosunkugi guy
intend to steal that bell?
101
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,490
Naruto!
102
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,290
Huh…?
103
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,790
You guys…are Gosunkugi’s…!
104
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,200
Are these guys going to corral us?!
105
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,500
Just like the time with Sazanami…
106
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,040
Byakugan.
107
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,490
Look out! Run!
108
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,490
Old Man Sazanami?!
109
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,490
Leave this to me!
110
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,410
All right!
111
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,040
Eat this!
112
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,620
What’re you doing here…?
113
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,660
I just came to settle the score.
114
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,120
But…your wound is still…
115
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,580
I won’t get in your way.
116
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,540
I’ll pursue the target on my own.
This is a competition!
117
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,490
I guess it can’t be helped.
I accept!
118
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,160
But we can’t even start
as things stand now!
119
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,450
There are still nails in the ground…
120
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,620
He’s waiting for the best moment.
121
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Gosunkugi!
122
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,250
The bell…is at the top!
123
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,490
What…?! Could it be…?!
124
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh, no…!
125
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,950
The nails in the ground aren’t moving.
126
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,250
The Jutsu has worn off!
127
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,910
What?!
128
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,450
Damn it! When did he--?!
129
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,120
So as the words say,
we’ve been “nailed down,” huh?
130
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,790
They're by the bell!
131
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,410
Why that--!
132
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,250
Wait! Don’t forget the bounty hunter
from last night is also after Gosunkugi!
133
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,660
No problem…! We’ll get there first,
no matter what!
134
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,370
Let’s go!
135
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,620
How awful…
136
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,490
That Gosunkugi jerk…!
137
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,620
Unforgivable!
138
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,950
Hey! Where’s Gosunkugi?!
139
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,500
Naruto! He’ll get away if we’re too slow!
140
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,450
We don’t have any time to think.
Let’s take care of this in one shot!
141
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,490
Gentle Fist!
142
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,250
Akamaru!
143
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,830
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…
144
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,500
Man-Beast Clone!
145
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,370
Fang Over Fang!
146
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,490

147
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,700
U-zu-ma-ki
148
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,620
Naruto Barrage!
149
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,540
Here I go…
150
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,660
I hit you with the back of the sword…
151
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,790
Where’s Gosunkugi?
152
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,490
That way!
153
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,540
Gosunkugi!
154
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,040
He’s ours!
155
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,540
Old man, you’re going to prove
your innocence, right?!
156
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,330
If you’re a bounty hunter,
then show your pride!
157
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,370
Ninja Art: Flying Nail Mist!
158

159
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,490
Eat this!
160
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,080
Too slow!
161
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,830
Farewell!
162
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,040
Damn it…!
163
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,750
It’s not over yet!
164
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,490
What?!
165
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,490
Prepare yourself!
166
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,290
W-Wait!
167
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,120
Don’t be hasty…
168
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,410
If I kill you, the one who can prove
my innocence will be gone!
169
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,620
We lose…
170
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,490
That’s right…
171
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,700
What?!
172
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,950
Bounty Sazanami,
otherwise known as Tokichi…
173
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,950
I, Gatsu, have apprehended you!
174
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,950
And you, bounty Gosunkugi!
175
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,700
Your spree of evil deeds…
176
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,250
The number of charges
against you is incalculable…
177
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,580
A government official has ordered
you hauled in for questioning!
178
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,660
Old man…
179
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,120
Damn it. There’s nothing we can do
if the opposition is a bureaucrat…
180
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,490
You murderer!
181
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,330
Give back the family you killed!
182
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,580
We’ll kill you in the same way!
183
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,290
Damn it…!
184
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,910
Hey, hey, you guys!
185
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,410
You’ve got nerve to put up wanted flyers
without doing a decent investigation!
186
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,580
This man is the true culprit behind
the murder that occurred in this village!
187
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,120
This Gosunkugi has already been
apprehended and has confessed.
188
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,490
And the weapon has been seized…
189
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,290
Therefore this individual Tokichi
shall be acquitted!
190
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,450
You jerks!
You made me work for free!
191
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,700
What’re you going to do about it?!
192
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,490
Why’d you do that for me?
193
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,080
I overheard some stupid tale
of woe, you see.
194
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,120
It makes no difference
to a bounty hunter…
195
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,040
But I overheard it,
and so I had no choice.
196
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,500
It was necessary to verify whether
or not you really are a wanted man…
197
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,580
You…
198
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,490
Not “you.” Gatsu!
199
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,700
I’m also a bounty hunter…
I’m in the same trade as you!
200
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,450
Gatsu…
201
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,490
Tokichi… We’re sorry.
202
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,620
Forgive us, Tokichi.
203
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,580
Good for you… Old Man Sazanami.
204
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,080
Let’s go.
205
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:46,200
I’ve kind of gotten homesick and
really miss the Leaf Village…
206
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,000
But you know, a failed mission
means failure…
207
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,080
The Fifth Hokage’s going
to scold you good, Naruto.
208
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,290
What?!
209
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You failed another mission?!
210
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,500
I…don’t want to go home…
211
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:41,120
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
212
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:52,580
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
213
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:04,040
What dreams did you chase to get here?
214
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:16,250
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
215
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:27,540
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
216
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:39,200
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
217
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,910
I’ll be close to you
218
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,790
Creeping up noisily,
a round, fat guy and a skinny one!
219
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,660
Beneath the scorching rain,
a disastrous tranquility ensues.
220
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,490
Tsunade hits the jackpot!
221
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,490
Kakashi's guess is a huge bust!
222
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,490
Heard it somewhere,
this unprecented event!
223
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,450
The great acts of
Monday and Pocha!
224
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,080
Then comes Naruto…
225
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,490
Let me join in
the training too!
226
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,490
Next time:
"The Appearance of Strange Visitors"
//%
1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,010
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,470
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,680
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,180
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,100
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,430
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,600
The Promise That Could Not Be Kept
21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,100
Kakashi Sensei…
22
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,850
Where’s Sasuke?
23
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,430
Kakashi!
24
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,010
How is Naruto Uzumaki’s condition?
25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,680
He’s okay.
26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,930
What about Sasuke?
Where’s Sasuke Uchiha?!
27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,550
How are the other Genin?
28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,300
Yes! By Lady Hokage’s order,
29
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,590
the first and second medical corps
have been dispatched…
30
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,050
The wounded from all areas have
already been gathered.
31
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,890
They were convoyed after
administering emergency treatment.
32
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,550
How are their conditions?
33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,390
Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries…
34
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,180
Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,
but it’s not life-threatening.
35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,590
Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi
are in serious condition…
36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,510
At this point,
there’s no telling what will happen.
37
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,180
Everyone…
38
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,590
The ingredients and
effects of the medicine
39
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,590
have been thoroughly researched.
40
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,430
Excellent…
41
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,600
Now bring the deer antler!
42
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,590
Yes, ma’am!
43
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
How is he…Big Sister?
44
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,470
No walks for him for quite a while…
45
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,550
The muscles of his limbs
have been severely damaged.
46
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,550
You’re a vet, right, Big Sister?
Can’t you somehow…?
47
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,590
It’ll be okay.
48
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,300
It’ll take time. But there’s no threat
to his life, so rest easy.
49
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,260
Walks for you are out of the question
for quite a while, too!
50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,010
Yeah, I know…
51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Intensive Care Unit 7
52
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,590
It’ll soon be three hours…
Please take over.
53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
All right!
54
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,930
Although we’re making
this kid’s hair into a conductor,
55
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,260
please don’t mistake the cellular rate
of the deficient parts!
56
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,680
Right!
57
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,970
As for the Chakra control, handle it
as if we’re threading a needle!
58
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,350
Understood!
59
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,590
Intensive Care Unit 6
60
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,100
There’s no point in
you getting frustrated, right?
61
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,720
Missions come with sacrifice…
62
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,430
You took the mental training, right?
63
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,220
Training and actual battle
are different, you know…
64
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,430
I know what missions are about…
65
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,590
And I thought I knew what
the Shinobi world is like.
66
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,260
I became a platoon leader
for the first time on this mission.
67
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,350
With that, I understood…
68
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,590
I’m not cut out to be a Shinobi.
69
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,180
Surprisingly fragile…for a man.
70
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,140
This time…
71
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,300
The only thing I was able to do
as platoon leader…
72
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,970
was to believe in everyone.
73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,590
I was naïve…
74
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,010
I didn’t have enough power…
75
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,300
It’s all my fault!
76
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,590
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
77
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,140
Shikamaru…
78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,010
Are you going to be argued down
by a girl and run away?
79
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,590
It’s a drag…
80
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,550
I don’t want to have arguments.
I’m not a woman.
81
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,180
Yeah… But you’re not a man, either.
82
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,010
You’re just a coward!
83
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,470
Even if you quit being Shinobi,
the missions will continue.
84
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,390
Someone has to do it.
85
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,550
Your comrades will just
be dispatched again…
86
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,640
under a different platoon leader.
87
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,050
And your comrades might die there.
88
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,760
But if at that time,
you were the platoon leader…
89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,140
your comrades might be saved
from that happening to them.
90
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,590
If you reflect on this time,
make use of the experience and learn,
91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,220
you might be able to carry out missions
with more perfection.
92
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,590
If you really think your comrades
are important to you,
93
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,180
before you think about running away…
94
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,350
think about becoming more exceptional
for the sake of your comrades!
95
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,470
That’s what real comrades are,
you coward!
96
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,930
Intensive Care Unit 6
97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,550
He’s okay, now!
98
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,260
The antidote has stopped
the death of cells
99
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,680
caused by the side effects of the Pills.
100
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,760
You were a big help this time, Shikaku!
101
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,180
The Nara Clan’s secret medicinal
preparation manual was very useful.
102
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,800
It must’ve been tough to
make something like that…
103
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,800
It’s the result of day-to-day study.
104
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,390
Thanks…
105
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,800
Lady Tsunade!
106
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,550
Neji Hyuga…
His safety line has been secured.
107
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,720
And, there’s some information…
108
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,590
Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki
have just now returned.
109
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,390
Although seriously injured,
it seems it’s not life-threatening.
110
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,100
Two, huh?
111
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,550
Shikamaru…
lt seems the mission is a failure.
112
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,510
But, everyone is alive!
That’s the most important thing.
113
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,510
Next time for sure…
114
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,590
I’ll carry out the mission perfectly!
115
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,590
Sasuke…You’re the chosen one.
116
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,760
Whatever… Just give me “power.”
117
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,590
Even though the form is different,
it’s still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes.
118
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,390
If you don’t want to die,
use more care in how you talk.
119
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,140
Wh-What? This quality of Chakra…
120
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,140
Yes… My future is inside this kid…
121
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,180
Hidden Leaf Hospital
122
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,390
I’m going to where Orochimaru is!
123
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,510
Please…bring back Sasuke!
124
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,680
I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!
I promise that on my life!
125
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,590
Oh…You were awake, huh?
126
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,260
Shikamaru!
127
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,050
I’m going on ahead to Choji!
What about you?
128
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,180
I’m going on ahead to…
Naruto and Sasuke!
129
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,600
I see… So everyone’s okay.
That’s good.
130
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,100
Then, Sasuke…
131
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,590
Yeah…he's gone.
132
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,850
Intensive Care Unit 6
133
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,470
Then, I still can’t see him…?
134
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,220
Yeah… But Lady Tsunade said that
he should regain consciousness soon.
135
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,590
Thank goodness…
136
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,260
It’s really a great help that
137
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,850
Lady Tsunade returned
to the Leaf Village.
138
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,430
If she hadn’t, right about now,
Choji would be…
139
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,970
The Lady Fifth…Hokage.
140
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,180
You’ve come to visit?
141
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,470
Information sure travels fast.
142
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,550
Sakura…
143
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,720
Naruto…
144
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,680
I heard you suffered
quite a serious injury…
145
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,300
But you look well, considering.
146
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,590
I’m sorry… Sakura…
147
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,140
Why do you apologize?
148
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,010
Being you, you probably
got reckless again, right?!
149
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,050
Jeez, you look like a mummy…
150
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,760
I’m sorry… I…
151
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,180
Hey… The weather’s nice today.
So open the curtains.
152
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,850
Sakura! I…
153
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,510
I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!
154
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
I promised on my life.
That’s what I said, so I…!
155
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,100
It’s okay already, Naruto…
156
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,800
Sakura! He…
157
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,590
I always…
158
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,600
said that, so… I…
159
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,430
I stick straight to what I say!
160
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,260
That’s my Way of Ninja!
161
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,590
Naruto…
162
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,720
Thanks, Naruto…
163
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,300
I’ll get right to healing this injury
and I’ve got to bring Sasuke back!
164
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,430
Wh-What was that?!
165
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,100
Per…Pervy Sage?!
166
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,550
Yo!
167
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,390
I’ve come today to tell you
something important.
168
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,180
From here on,
as my official disciple,
169
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,260
I’ll train you to become
a full-fledged Shinobi in three years.
170
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,050
Three years…?
171
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I’ve received some credible information
from a certain source
172
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,010
concerning the “Akatsuki.”
173
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,600
Akatsuki…
174
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,720
It seems that it will be
three or four years
175
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,590
before they come after you next.
176
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,720
I don’t care about that!
177
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,930
Talking about stuff that’s
so far down the road…
178
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,050
I don’t have the time
to be doing slowpoke training!
179
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,350
What do you mean?
180
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,510
If I don’t go after
Sasuke immediately,
181
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,430
he might be killed by Orochimaru!
182
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,850
“Immortal” doesn’t mean that
the flesh is being maintained as is.
183
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,800
Before his body decays,
184
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,350
a strong and new flesh will be made
into a vessel for his soul.
185
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,430
It seems you’ve learned
of the true purpose
186
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,590
for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke…
187
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,590
Huh?! Then that means you also knew…?
188
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,050
I was looking into
Orochimaru’s Immortality Jutsu.
189
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,890
It seems with that Jutsu,
190
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,590
he can’t reincarnate into
the next body for three years.
191
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,260
And unable to wait for Sasuke,
he just recently reincarnated…
192
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,970
It’ll be okay for three years from now…
There is time.
193
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,930
That’s not a lie, is it?!
194
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,180
Not a lie, is it?!
195
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,470
Nope…
196
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,850
However…
197
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,850
Forget about Sasuke…
198
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,180
Sasuke went to Orochimaru
on his own accord.
199
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,390
No matter what you do,
he won’t change.
200
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,720
I’ve seen many Shinobi, so I know…
201
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,300
Sasuke is the same kind
as Orochimaru.
202
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,590
If you’re thinking about bringing him back,
just forget it.
203
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,850
That’s something an arrogant fool
would do!
204
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,680
He may be nothing to you
but he’s my friend!
205
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,590
Would a friend hurt his comrade?!
206
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,720
Take a look at your current plight!
207
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,100
This is…!
208
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,590
Why? Why would you…?
209
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,760
We were called Sannin together…
210
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,890
Weren’t we comrades
since we were kids?!
211
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,970
In every regard,
you’re a foolish guy, Jiraiya…
212
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,220
You lack thought
in everything you do.
213
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,390
That’s why you didn’t notice
what I was doing.
214
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,600
Can’t you rethink it, Orochimaru?
215
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,590
Absurd!
216
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,430
How can you be so stupid?!
217
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,720
No matter how much I wanted it…
218
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,180
in the end, there was no way
he would come back.
219
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,550
After the agony, all that’s left was
my own powerlessness and regret.
220
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,590
I don’t want you to go through
the same thing…
221
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,180
If you’re going to go after Sasuke,
then there’ll be no training.
222
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,800
I’ll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you
223
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,890
and depending on the case,
prohibit you from leaving the village.
224
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
You’re not just an ordinary kid…
225
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,430
You possess the Nine Tail Fox
that the Akatsuki is after!
226
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,220
This is serious.
I'll just have to do that…
227
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,930
if you’re going to act on your own
without listening to what I say.
228
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,300
Eventually, you’re going to have to deal
229
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,470
with guys more troublesome
than Orochimaru.
230
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,720
Give up on Sasuke.
231
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,640
Sooner or later this was
going to happen.
232
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,590
Don’t suffer anymore!
Forget and dismiss him.
233
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,010
It’s not just Jutsu or power…
234
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,100
If you’re a Shinobi, develop eyes that
can make the right judgment.
235
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,590
And if you’re going to live
as a Shinobi, become wise.
236
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,850
If you remain a fool…
237
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,550
the reality is that it will be tough
living in this world.
238
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,050
Fine.
239
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,260
If that’s what being wise is…
240
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,590
Then I’m fine being a fool for life!
241
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,590
Even if by myself,
242
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,590
I’ll create even more awesome Jutsu
and save Sasuke no matter what!
243
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,260
And, and,
I’ll even kick the Akatsuki’s butt!
244
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,590
If someone like you
were to do it alone…
245
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,430
the best you’d be able
to come up with
246
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,470
would be some
stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.
247
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,890
It might somehow work out
248
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,720
if you are a big fool and
not an ordinary fool…
249
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,010
Be prepared once
you’re out of the hospital,
250
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,890
you big fool.
251
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,050
See you then.
252
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,590
Roger!
253
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,100
– It’s been seven years since…
– …all the members gathered like this.
254
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,050
Since Orochimaru left
the organization.
255
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,050
That Orochimaru has gotten
the Sharingan.
256
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,010
Itachi…Your little brother?
257
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,590
Don’t get hasty. Yeah.
258
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,470
We’ll kill Orochimaru eventually…
259
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,890
More importantly,
there are only three years left.
260
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,680
Can everyone accomplish
the work required of them?
261
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,760
Huh?
262
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,300
Yes, our goal is…
263
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,680
to get everything,
including the Nine Tail Fox in question!
264
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,010
When I recalled the parts one by one,
265
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:35,470
I felt as though
I had understood everything
266
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:45,930
Faded words which I kept so close to me
267
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:55,640
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
268
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,590
and this distant yearning for you
269
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:11,760
I live, simply repeating this cycle
270
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:23,590
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
271
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:33,930
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
272
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,600
I’ll keep these thoughts…
273
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,800
Sakura’s been weird all along
ever since Sasuke left.
274
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,640
I can’t put it well,
275
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,590
but she’s gloomy or fretting
or something.
276
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,180
On top of that she says,
“This time I’ll do my best on my own.”
277
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,470
What the heck does that mean?
278
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,850
It’s bugging me, it’s bugging me!
279
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,220
This isn’t the time for me
to be relaxing in the hospital!
280
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,220
Next episode:
“Deep Cover?! A Super S-Rank Mission”
//%
1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,290
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,060
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,120
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,690
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,690
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,690
Now
12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,040
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,310
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,480
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,820
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,690
If there’s an instance that we
become separated,
20
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,690
don’t trust him if he looks
like your teammate.
21
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,990
Just like now there’s a possibility
22
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,690
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!
23
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,690
Yeah.
24
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,260
So what do we do?
25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,030
We’ll decide on a password.
26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,400
Password?
27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,140
I’ll only say it once so listen closely.
28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,010
You ask Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”
29
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,410
And the answer is this:
30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,750
“It is a chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.
31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,550
“The quiet place has
no secret hideout.
32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,790
“It is important for
a Shinobi to know the right time.
33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,690
“The time when an enemy
is tired and drops his guard.”
34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,960
That’s it.
35
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,530
H-Huge!
36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
T-Tail!
37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,110
You want our Earth Scroll, don’t you?
38
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,090
Well, let's begin...
39
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,130
the battle for the Scrolls.
40
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,570
Life or death!
41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,310
If this creature doesn’t want
to spit me out …
42
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,980
I’ll make it to do so at any cost!
43
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
44
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,330
I can’t move!
45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,140
I wanted you to entertain me more.
46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,940
It’s too bad.
47
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,680
Move!
48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,320
He wiped out the fear with pain.
49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,530
As expected,
he’s not the average prey.
50
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,900
Don’t come near me!
51
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,480
Don’t lower your guard,
not even for a moment…
52
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,330
A prey must always stay tense
and flee desperately
53
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,230
before a predator!
54
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,680
Sorry Sasuke.
55
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,090
Naruto!
56
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,600
The password… I forgot it!
57
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,700
Naruto's Counterattack:
Never Give In!
58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,680
The password... I forgot it!
59
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,980
That’s all right, Naruto!
60
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,280
Awesome!
61
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,720
Naruto!
62
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,320
I know you tried to be cool and
intended to rescue us, but…
63
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,390
Don’t put your nose in this!
64
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,460
Escape!
65
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,760
This thing…
She’s on a far different level!
66
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,700
Seems like you brought that
giant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.
67
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,470
No matter how you look,
she looks like a snake…
68
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,680
I get it, it was the handiwork
of this woman.
69
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,590
The situation has never gotten any better
with him showing up for the rescue.
70
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
But what should I do…?
71
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,200
Hey hey hey! Evidently you’ve been
bullying the weakling!
72
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,270
Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here,
73
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,440
I’m going to wipe the floor with you!
74
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,440
Darn it! If it continues like this,
all three of us are done for!
75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,350
What should I do?
76
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,720
Sasuke...
77
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,100
It’s no good.
78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,430
This is the only way.
79
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,670
Wait.
80
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,670
Hmm?
81
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,340
– Huh?! 					– Huh?
82
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,680
If it’s the scroll you want,
I’ll give it to you.
83
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,590
I’m asking you.
Just take this and go.
84
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,020
Huh?!
85
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,490
What?!
86
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,730
Hey, Sasuke!
What are you doing?
87
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,630
Why are you giving
our scroll to the enemy?
88
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,430
You, shut up!
89
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,670
What …?!
90
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,670
I see… 					You’re sensible.
91
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,680
The only thing the “prey” can
hope for from the “predator” is
92
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,250
presenting other food and
pray you would be spared, isn’t it?
93
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,500
Take it.
94
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,630
Wha--?!
95
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,570
You! Don’t interfere with this!
96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,680
Don’t you understand this situation?!
97
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,690
What're you doing all of a sudden?!
98
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,540
As for me,
I don’t remember the password…
99
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,670
So I got no way to make sure.
100
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,110
But you, you’re an imposter
Sasuke,  aren’t you?
101
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,250
Naruto!
102
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,980
W-What are you trying to start?!
103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,650
You loser! 					I’m the real me!
104
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,890
Liar.
105
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:16,070
This, this stupid coward is... absolutely...
not the Sasuke I know!
106
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,440
I don’t know how strong she is but,
107
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,640
how can you be sure that she’ll let us
go if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!
108
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,180
You’re the one who choked and
doesn’t understand this situation!
109
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,350
Naruto.
110
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,190
That’s correct.
111
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,700
The Scroll.
112
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,440
I could just kill you
and seize it.
113
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,640
Don’t mess with me!
114
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,480
Run, Naruto! Stop it!
115
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,310
Darn it!
116
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,180
I’ve lost confidence in you, Sasuke!
117
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,850
Summoning Jutsu!
118
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,130
Naruto!
119
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
There are three corpses.
120
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,980
This is some kind of Ninja Art,
isn’t it… ?
121
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,450
This is bad.
122
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,660
We have a problem,
from the get go.
123
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,230
I’ll be darned.
124
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,540
Inform Anko,
the Proctor of the second test.
125
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Yes, sir!
126
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,650
If you’re going to have dumplings,
you’ve got to have sweet red bean soup.
127
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,450
Okay...
Once I’ve eaten this,
128
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,990
I should break through and
go wait at the tower for the kids.
129
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,700
With this program, the quick kids
should clear it soon.
130
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,100
The Leaf Village mark, perfect!
131
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,640
We have a problem, Ms. Anko!
132
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,880
Huh? What, so suddenly?
133
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,810
Corpses! Three of them!
134
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,520
Moreover, they’re strange.
135
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,650
Anyway, please come!
136
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,590
Strange?
137
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,200
I checked their possessions
and identification,
138
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,670
Ninjas from Grass Village
registered in the Chunin Exam, but…
139
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,810
As you can see...
140
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,680
They have no faces.
141
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,820
Yes.
142
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,690
They’re smooth and flat,
like they melted away.
143
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,530
Without a doubt...
144
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,700
This Jutsu is...
145
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,600
that man’s...
146
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,040
Why is he at this test…?
147
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,630
Show me the ID photos of
these three Grass Village Ninjas.
148
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,030
It’s on their applications.
149
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,140
Yes!
150
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,670
So this one’s face was robbed.
151
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,480
Then, at that time it was already…
152
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,980
I’ll return… the Kunai knife.
153
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,490
Thank you for your trouble.
154
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,530
We’re in big trouble.
155
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,390
Huh?!
156
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,030
Communicate this to
Lord Hokage right away!
157
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,230
Make a call for action to
the Anbu Black Ops
158
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,200
to assemble more than two squads
to the Forest of Death!
159
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,340
Starting now,
I’m going to follow these guys!
160
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,210
Got it?
161
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,910
Yes!
162
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,340
That guy…
163
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,380
That guy... has come to Leaf Village!
164
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,930
Cute.
165
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,070
You’re such a cute prey.
166
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,240
Naruto!
167
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,670
Narutooo!
168
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,650
Well, polish him off.
169
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,940
Shove it!
170
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,150
This brat! Can’t be…
171
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,760
Naruto… He’s lost control…
172
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,100
But... that Naruto,
why is he so strong?!
173
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,690
Those eyes...
174
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,460
There’s no mistake.
175
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,990
That’s... Naruto?!
176
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,700
This just got interesting.
177
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,030
Next is...
178
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,670
Sasuke.
179
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,710
Now what’s your move?!
180
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,150
Sasuke!
181
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,090
I have to hurry.
182
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,560
I get this...
183
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,670
bad feeling.
184
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,390
Hey.  Are you hurt?
185
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,700
Scaredy cat?!
186
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,670
Naruto!
187
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,310
Hey!
188
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,480
Are you hurt...
189
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,350
Scaredy cat?
190
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,690
Sasuke!
191
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,300
This stupid coward is absolutely
not the Sasuke I know!
192
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,410
Huh?!
193
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,810
Darn it! 					Let me go!
194
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,580
You stupid snake!
195
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,550
To think that the
nine-tailed brat lived…
196
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,200
When you get excited, a bit
of the nine-tail’s power trickles out…
197
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,240
You’ve grown up interesting.
198
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,440
Look…
199
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,140
The Seal is appearing on
your skin like a tattoo.
200
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,320
Five-Pronged…Sealing!
201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,930
Sasuke! Help Naruto!
202
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,680
Twelve years since the seal…
203
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,320
Naruto’s Chakras and the nine-tail’s
Chakras are beginning to act in synch…
204
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,060
But  now... you’re in the way.
205
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
He’s gonna fall as it is!
206
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,300
Naruto!
207
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,540
What happened Sasuke?!
208
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,810
Sasuke…
209
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,860
Naruto’s certainly different
from you, Sasuke.
210
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,690
He’s a klutz and
kind of gets in the way.
211
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,060
But he’s not in the least a coward!
212
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Right? 					lsn’t that right?
213
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,540
You foolish little brother.
214
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
If you want to kill me,
resent me, hate me and…
215
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,820
continue to live your ugly life.
216
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,690
Flee.
217
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,720
Flee and hang on to your life.
218
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,960
No!
219
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,610
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…
his blood has begun to stir…
220
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,610
Sasuke!
221
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,550
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.
222
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,260
Hey, can you hear it?
223
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:32,540
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
224
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:42,010
The ocean spans limitlessly
225
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:50,390
Please keep that smile on your face forever
226
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,330
Or else I’ll cry
227
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,200
You won't have to search around you
228
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,730
It’s all ok now.
229
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:13,680
Everyone is inside
this hand
230
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,150
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
231
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,690
When you forget what happiness is
232
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,520
Just sing.
233
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,760
Light is born, and darkness was born
234
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,100
The two are one
235
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,570
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
236
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,080
Hey, can you hear it?
237
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,120
I'm an avenger.
238
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,720
To defeat my brother,
today I have to survive!
239
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,530
But how can a person who won't risk
his life in a situation like this
240
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,390
beat my brother?
241
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,560
Calm down, you should be able to see.
242
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,930
There should be some way
to intercept her movements.
243
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,670
Next episode: "The Sharingan Revived:
Dragon-Flame Jutsu!"
//%
1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,990
A long time ago, a powerful demon fox
appeared with nine tails.
2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,990
With its powerful tails,
3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,120
it could smash mountains
and create tidal waves.
4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,580
A band of Ninjas rose to
defend their village from attack.
5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,620
We have to wait until
the Fourth Hokage gets here!
6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,080
We can't let it get any closer
to our village!
7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:38,660
One great Ninja was able to
imprison the monster,
8
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,990
but died in the process.
9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:47,160
This Ninja was known as…
the Fourth Hokage.
10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,660
Naruto!
11
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,790
Why did you do such a thing?!
12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,080
You're really gonna get it this time!
13
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,120
I don't care!
14
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,540
You know your problem?
15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,990
You can't do the things I do!
16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,990
Only I can do this!
17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,370
I'm better than all of you!
Believe it!
18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,990
There's a problem, sir!
19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,830
Lord Hokage!
20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,910
What is it?
21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,450
Did that Naruto do something again?
22
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,790
Yes. He climbed onto
the Mountainside Images…
23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,990
And he vandalized and
graffitied all over them!
24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,990
Wait!
25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
Ha ha…
26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,200
Why should I?
27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, Naruto!
28
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,080
How did you suddenly get here,
lruka Sensei?
29
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,080
The question is what are you doing here
when you should be in class now?
30
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,250
Now listen, Naruto.
31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,990
You failed the last graduation test
and the one before that.
32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,870
This is no time
to be goofing off, you fool!
33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,990
We will have a re-test on
the Transformation Jutsu!
34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,790
Even those who already passed
will take it!
35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,990
Whaaaat?!
36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,450
Sakura Haruno. Here I go…
37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,120
Transform!
38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,990
OK!
39
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,870
I did it!
40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,990
Cha!
41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,200
Did you see that, Sasuke?
42
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,990
Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,870
Yes.
44
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,540
O-OK.
45
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,990
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,290
This is a real pain.
47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,990
And it's all your fault.
48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,370
Like I care!!
49
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,040
OK…
50
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,660
Good luck, Naruto…
51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,990
Transform!
52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,120
How was it?
53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,620
I call it the "Sexy Jutsu"!
54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,910
You fool!
Stop making idiotic spells!
55
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,750
Darn…
56
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,410
Darn…
57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,120
I won't let you go home
unless you clean that all up.
58
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,120
I don't care…
59
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,830
There's nobody home anyway.
60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,370
Naruto...
61
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,580
What is it this time?
62
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,910
What I meant was…
63
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,990
If you clean up all that mess,
I'll buy you ramen tonight.
64
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,250
Huh?!
65
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes!
I-I will finish it no time!
66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,540
Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
67
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,790
Naruto.
68
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,990
Why did you vandalize those faces?
69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,290
Don't you know who
the Hokage leaders are?
70
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,200
Of course, I do!
71
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,080
I know they earned the title
Lord Hokage
72
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,910
because they were the best Ninja
of their time, right?
73
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,990
Especially the Fourth Hokage
was a hero
74
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,990
who saved the village from
the nine-tail demon fox.
75
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,990
Then why did you do that?
76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,450
Because I'll become a Hokage myself.
77
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,990
And I'll be the greatest Hokage
of all time!
78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,000
So that everyone will finally
learn to accept me!
79
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,330
By the way, Sensei,
I have a favor to ask.
80
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,330
You want another bowl?
81
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,910
Mmmm…No…
82
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,500
Can I borrow that Leaf headband
for a while?
83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,080
This?
84
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,790
No no!
85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,990
This is worn only by those who
have graduated from Ninja Academy.
86
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,990
Tomorrow, you will…
87
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,910
You're so mean!
88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,990
So that's why you took off
your goggles…
89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,410
Humph...
One more bowl please!
90
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,580
We are now about to begin
the graduation test.
91
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,040
When your name is called,
proceed to the next classroom.
92
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,200
The test is on the Clone Jutsu.
93
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,990
Oh no…
94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,080
Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!
95
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,580
But still…
I will do it no matter what!
96
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,160
Clone Jutsu!
97
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,830
Disqualified!
98
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,000
Iruka Sensei.
99
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,990
His physical coordination
and stamina are excellent.
100
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,660
And he managed to come up
with something.
101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Isn't that enough
for him to pass?
102
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,950
Mizuki Sensei...
All the others created three or more clones.
103
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,080
Naruto created just one.
104
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,000
And it's practically useless.
I can't give him a passing mark.
105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,370
I 'm a Ninja now!
106
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,700
You did well. That's my son.
107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,870
Congratulations for your graduation.
108
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,660
I'll cook something good tonight!
109
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,620
Look at that one.
110
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,040
It's that boy.
I hear he's the only one who failed.
111
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,620
Serves him right.
112
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,330
Imagine what would happen
if he became a Ninja.
113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,990
Isn't that the boy
who is actually…
114
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,580
Hey! We're not supposed to
talk about that.
115
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,290
Iruka.
We need to talk later.
116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,790
Yes, sir.
117
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,790
Iruka Sensei isn't trying
to be mean to you.
118
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,830
Then why only me?
119
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,990
He wants you to become strong
from the bottom of his heart.
120
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,540
You both don't have parents.
121
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,080
But I really wanted to graduate.
122
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,330
Heh... I guess I have no choice…
123
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,790
I'll let you in on a big secret.
124
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,410
Secret?
125
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,370
Iruka.
126
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,450
What is it, Lord Hokage?
127
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,870
I know how you feel. But…
128
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,700
Naruto also grew up without knowing
the love of his parents…like you.
129
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,990
Let me go!
130
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,580
My mom and dad are
still out there fighting!
131
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,830
Wake up, Iruka Sensei!
132
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,450
What's the matter?
133
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,040
Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!
134
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,910
I heard that Naruto…
stole the Scroll of Sealing.
135
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,540
The Scroll of Sealing?!
136
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,870
Let's see…
137
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,750
The first Jutsu is…
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?
138
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,700
What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?
139
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,950
Lord Hokage!
We can't forgive him!
140
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,990
This is not just a prank!
141
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,990
The Scroll is a dangerous item
that the First Hokage sealed!
142
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,950
Depending on its use…
143
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,990
It will be a major disaster if
it is taken out of the village!
144
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,370
Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!
145
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,370
Yes, sir!
146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
Where did you go…Naruto?
147
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,790
I will tell everyone in the village
about this and eliminate Naruto…
148
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,250
Then the Scroll of Sealing
will be mine!
149
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,370
Hey you, Naruto!
150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,990
You found me..
151
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,990
And I've only learned one Jutsu.
152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,160
He's been practicing the Jutsu…
153
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,500
until he's become
this exhausted and dirty…?
154
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,910
Listen, listen!
I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!
155
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,990
You're gonna let me graduate
if I can do it!
156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,910
Isn't it true that I can graduate if
I can do one of the Jutsu written here?
157
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,990
Who told you that?
158
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,990
Mizuki Sensei. He told me
about this scroll, and this place…
159
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,290
Mizuki did?!
160
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,330
I'm impressed you found this place.
161
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,080
I see now…how it is.
162
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,660
Naruto, give me that scroll.
163
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,250
Wait, wait…
What's going on here?
164
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,250
Naruto! Never give him that scroll!
165
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,200
It is a dangerous object that contains
forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.
166
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,990
Mizuki used you in order to
get it for himself!
167
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,500
W-Wha--?
168
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of
you holding that scroll!
169
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,990
Huh?
170
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,830
What are you saying, Mizuki!
Don't let him fool you, Naruto!
171
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,250
I will tell you the truth.
172
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,660
Idiot! Don't do that!
173
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,370
After an incident 12 years ago,
a rule was created.
174
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,250
A rule?
175
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,370
That is, Naruto, a rule everybody
but you knows.
176
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,540
Except me?! 					What is it?
177
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,410
Stop it, Mizuki!
178
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,990
The rule forbids anyone from revealing
that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!
179
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,370
Huh?
180
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,040
You are actually the Demon,
Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
181
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,120
who killed Iruka's parents and
destroyed our village!
182
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,540
Stop it!
183
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,080
Everyone has been
deceiving you ever since.
184
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,370
Didn't you find it strange?
185
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,000
Why everyone hated you so much?
186
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,120
No! No! No! No! No!
187
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,080
Naruto…
188
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,750
Nobody accepts you.
That's why Iruka hates you so much!
189
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,990
Iruka... Naruto grew up
without the love of parents.
190
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,870
Everyone avoids him like
the plague after what happened.
191
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,500
That's why he keeps misbehaving.
192
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,370
It's the only way for him to get
any attention or acknowledgement.
193
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,990
He pretends to be tough,
but inside he is really hurting.
194
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,040
Die, Naruto!
195
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,120
Naruto! 					Get down!
196
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,540
Why…?
197
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,080
Because you and I are the same.
198
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,990
After my parents died,
199
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,990
nobody paid attention to me
or gave me any support.
200
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,250
I wasn't a good student in school.
201
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,990
I was the class clown…
because I wanted people to notice me.
202
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,700
I couldn't get noticed through excellence,
so I kept doing stupid things.
203
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,200
It was so hard.
204
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,750
Isn't that right, Naruto?
205
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,660
You felt so lonely…right?
And you suffered inside, right?
206
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,750
I'm sorry, Naruto….
207
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,950
If I had been more responsible,
maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.
208
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,790
Don't make me laugh!
209
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,250
Iruka has always hated you,
ever since you killed his parents!
210
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,990
He's just saying all that
to get the Scroll of Sealing back!
211
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,160
Naruto!
212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,990
Narutoooooo!
213
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,450
He is not the type of kid
who will change his mind.
214
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,830
He will take revenge against
our village using that scroll!
215
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,990
Didn't you see his eyes?
Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.
216
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,330
No…
Naruto…isn't…like that at all!
217
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,990
All I want is to kill Naruto
and get the scroll.
218
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,200
I'll take care of you later!
219
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,370
I-I won't let you…
220
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,370
Well, well.
221
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,990
Mizuki has a big mouth!
222
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,290
Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.
223
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,080
He might unleash
the power locked up inside him.
224
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,080
The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.
225
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,410
There's a slight chance
he might actually release
226
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,830
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
sealed inside him!
227
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,990
If that happens…
228
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,540
I've found him!
229
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,410
Naruto!
230
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,580
Everything that Mizuki said
was a lie!
231
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,790
Give me that scroll, quick!
Mizuki is after the scroll!
232
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,990
It can't be…
233
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,250
Why is it, Naruto?
234
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,120
How…
235
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,950
did you know I wasn't Iruka…?
236
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,870
Because I'm Iruka.
237
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,700
I see.
238
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,540
What's in it for you to protect
the one who killed your family?
239
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,250
I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot
like you get that scroll!
240
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,990
You're the idiot.
Naruto is the same as me.
241
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,120
Same?
242
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,370
Anyone can do whatever
he wants once he has the scroll.
243
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,580
There is no way that that monster…
244
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,080
that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage
of the power of that scroll!
245
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
You're right…
246
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,580
I guess it was true all along!
247
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:51,330
See, Iruka Sensei never really
cared for me at all!
248
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,500
...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.
249
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,290
But Naruto is different!
250
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,620
I know that he is an exceptional student.
251
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,990
He works very hard,
252
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,120
and he's single-minded
and clumsy at the same time.
253
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,290
No one accepts him, but he knows
the meaning of human suffering.
254
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,990
He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.
255
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,700
He's Naruto Uzumaki of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
256
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,660
You are so gullible. 					lruka!
257
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,250
I was gonna take you down later,
but I have changed my mind.
258
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,040
Die!
259
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,290
I guess this is the end for me…
260
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,870
Naruto?!
261
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,500
You surprised me there, freak.
262
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,120
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!
263
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,330
Shut up! I can take care of a kid
like you with a single blow!
264
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,200
Why don't you try then?
I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!
265
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,250
Let's see you try!
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
266
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,120
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
267
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,040
Naruto! You've…
268
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,910
Those aren't just images but actual clones!
That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
269
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,790
What's this…?
270
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,750
What's the matter? 					C'mon!
271
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,410
Weren't you gonna get me
with one blow? Here!
272
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,080
In that case…
I'll come to you.
273
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,990
I kinda got carried away.
lruka Sensei, are you okay?
274
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,620
Yeah.
275
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,830
He's really something.
276
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,990
Maybe it is true.
277
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe he will surpass all
the Hokage leaders…
278
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,450
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.
279
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,990
Has anyone found Naruto yet?
280
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,990
No.
281
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,000
Darn, this is going to be bad…
282
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,250
There's no need to worry anymore.
283
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,660
Lord Hokage!
284
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,200
He'll be back soon.
285
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,870
Sensei, how much longer?
286
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,450
OK, you may open your eyes now.
287
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,870
Congratulations…on your graduation.
288
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,620
In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!
289
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,120
Iruka Sensei!
290
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,870
That hurts!
291
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,990
Naruto…
292
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,830
I was going to lecture to you...
293
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,330
that the road gets more difficult
now that you're a Ninja.
294
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,040
But I guess I'll just wait to tell you
that until we get to the ramen stand…
295
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,410
W-What do you want, you little shrimp?
Quit following me!
296
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,290
You're smaller than me and
297
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,540
you're saying that you're gonna
become the Fifth Hokage?
298
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,790
I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's
grandson or not.
299
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,330
It's not that easy to be a Hokage!
300
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,990
If you want it that bad,
you're gonna have to beat me first!
301
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,990
Next episode:
"My Name Is Konohamaru!"
302
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,700
Watch my outstanding performance!
//%
1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,560
C'mon!
2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,560
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,670
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,110
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,780
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,550
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,480
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,320
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,890
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,000
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,170
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,340
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,770
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:10,350
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,850
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,560
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,730
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,570
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,530
Darn it!
21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,000
Where'd he attack from?!
ls it the clones?
22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,400
Where's the real body?!
23
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,440
It's useless for you to even attempt
following with your eyes.
24
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,010
I absolutely will not be caught.
25
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,880
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,680
Don't!
27
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,530
This is a teleportation Jutsu that
28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,560
uses mirrors that can
reflect only my image.
29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,630
Watching you from the speed I move,
30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,470
it almost seems as if
you aren't moving at all…
31
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,740
I knew it!
32
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,640
Is that Jutsu…
the Kekkei Genkai?!
33
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,340
Kekkei…Genkai…?
34
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,550
It's the same type as
my Sharingan…
35
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,350
Then…!
36
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,420
That's right…
37
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,650
It's impossible even for me
to copy that Jutsu…
38
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,920
And there's no way to destroy
that Jutsu, either!
39
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,560
Darn it…
40
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,570
So… What?!
41
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,070
I can't die here yet.
42
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,910
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality…
43
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,540
The dream to have my strength
recognized by everyone in the village…
44
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,980
and become the Hokage!
45
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,550
Dream…
46
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,090
I, for the sake of my dream.
And you, for the sake of your dream.
47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,590
Please don't hold it against me.
48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,060
I want to protect someone
special to me…
49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,900
I work for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,
50
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,670
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality…
51
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,540
That's my dream.
52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,310
For the sake of that dream
I will completely become a Shinobi,
53
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,850
and kill you guys!
54
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,930
Zero Visibility:
The Sharingan Shatters
55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,730
Sasuke! Naruto!
Don't lose to a guy like that!
56
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,500
Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!
57
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,540
What?
58
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,640
Even if there was a chance that
we could break that technique,
59
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,110
they won't be able to defeat that boy.
60
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,320
W-What do you mean?
61
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,220
They don't have the mentality
to kill their feelings…
62
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,560
and kill another person!
63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,230
That boy really knows
the agony of being a Shinobi.
64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,470
He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.
65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,300
Exactly…
66
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,070
No real Shinobi will come out of
a peace-addicted village like yours.
67
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,550
Because they are not able
to learn
68
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,550
the most important "experience of killing"!
69
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,020
Then…
70
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,050
Then…
71
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,460
What are we going to do, Sensei?!
72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
If I go over to
Naruto and Sasuke,
73
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,930
Tazuna will be in danger.
74
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,330
Even if I try the Shadow Clones.
75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,510
He'll come to stop me with
his Water Clones.
76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,380
I'll just be wasting Chakra.
77
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,550
Then...
78
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,550
I'm sorry but...
79
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm going to have to finish
this in an instant.
80
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,190
Sharingan?!
81
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,730
The Sharingan again?
82
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,260
Such an unimaginative guy!
83
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,250
Sensei!
84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,320
You might call me "an unimaginative guy,"
85
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,130
but you are afraid of the Sharingan,
after all... Zabuza!
86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,270
The secret technique of a Shinobi…
87
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,740
isn't something that you show
your opponent so many times.
88
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,540
Be appreciative.
89
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,680
You're the only who has had
the chance to see it twice…
90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,550
And there will be no third time…
91
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,890
Even if you were able to defeat me,
you can't defeat Haku…
92
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,090
What…?
93
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,400
Kakashi Sensei can't win?
94
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,560
That boy in the mask is that strong?
95
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,540
Since he was a kid, I have been
painstakingly teaching him
96
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,800
the battle techniques of the Ninja!
97
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,360
All of my techniques.
98
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,100
On top of that…
99
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,100
he has been polishing up
his own skills as well!
100
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,910
As a result...
101
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,640
He has...
102
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,750
no matter how unbelievably difficult
his predicament,
103
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,520
been extremely successful.
104
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,760
He has no "heart" and has
abandoned the notion of "life."
105
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,560
He is a fighting machine
known as a Shinobi.
106
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,570
Not only that,
his Jutsu surpasses mine!
107
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,670
The terrifying ability of
the Kekkei Genkai.
108
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,270
In other words,
I have acquired a sophisticated tool.
109
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,550
Unlike the scrap you're
carrying around.
110
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm not one to be afraid just
because I failed once!
111
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,550
I'll do it as many times as it takes!
112
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,420
The Shadow Clone Jutsu!
113
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,550
Stop!
114
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
W-What the hell is it…?!
115
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,960
I-It was just slight but…
116
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,210
I could see the trails of his movements…
117
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,470
One more try!
118
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,140
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
119
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,230
Don't you understand that it's useless?
120
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,640
Just because I see the trail,
121
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,110
doesn't mean that I can keep up
with his speed.
122
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,590
The water…
is being repelled.
123
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,690
But, what if that wasn't water…?
124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
All right…
125
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,300
The next one is going
to be my one shot!
126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just because a bunch of scrap
got together
127
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,940
doesn't mean that
they can defeat Haku.
128
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,540
He is….
He is the best tool!
129
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,150
There's nothing boring than
a stranger bragging…
130
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,620
It's about time…
I make my move.
131
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,750
Now wait.
As long as we're talking…
132
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,560
Let me brag about another thing…
133
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,560
Hmm?
134
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,530
In the battle before,
135
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,900
I didn't just let you defeat me
like a fool.
136
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,050
It's over…
137
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,690
Haku, who was hiding in the corner,
138
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,960
was observing part of the battle.
139
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,130
Haku is quite smart.
140
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,960
With his ability to analyze,
141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,930
he is able to plan a counterattack
after observing a technique just once.
142
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,610
I've been anxious to copy your line.
143
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,750
"I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsu
won't work on me twice."
144
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,380
Was that it…?
145
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,320
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
146
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,080
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
147
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,750
This is...?!
148
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,430
What is this…?
This really thick fog?
149
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,940
The visibility is close to zero...
150
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,500
Sensei…!
151
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,540
Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!
152
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,310
That's right.
153
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,550
I have to trust Sasuke,
Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right now…
154
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,350
And I should do what I can do!
155
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,420
Huh?
156
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,190
Oh! Sakura!
157
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,830
Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,
don't move away from me!
158
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,260
Yeah… I soo know it!
159
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,540
I know… 					Zabuza…
160
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,300
I'll finish them off soon enough…
161
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,840
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
162
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,550
You just don't learn, do you?!
163
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,560
What? The Fire Style Jutsu!
164
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,300
It takes…too long!
165
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,510
This is good!
166
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,780
Bit by bit, I'm figuring out
the timing...
167
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,720
I know it's called Hidden Mist,
but the fog is way too thick…
168
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,360
Even Zabuza himself shouldn't
be able to see anything...
169
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,540
Good job on dodging it…
170
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,140
Just what I expect of Kakashi
of the Sharingan...
171
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,610
He's….
172
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,680
closing his eyes!
173
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,020
But…the next time you see me,
174
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,350
that'll be the end of it all…
175
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,020
You overrate the Sharingan too much.
176
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,920
What…?
177
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,800
You spoke as if you saw through
everything, but…
178
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,400
Why?
179
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,940
Could it be possible that
you can see the future…?!
180
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,710
You are going to die.
181
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,550
Your foresight was wrong, after all.
182
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,550
Kakashi...
183
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,390
You can't read my mind or
my future...
184
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,860
The Sharingan is merely a diversion
that makes you believe that!
185
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,760
Those who have the Sharingan...
186
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,770
possess both
perceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes…
187
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,340
Using these two powers and
bringing out Jutsus one after the other..
188
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,680
you were just acting as if
you can read the future!
189
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,020
First with the perceptive eyes,
you copied my movement right away.
190
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,820
And this is the Image
Replication Method.
191
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,670
You first got me in
a ruffle with it…
192
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,940
Once you make sure that
I'm flustered,
193
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,310
you nail the "heart's voice."
194
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,810
– This is the Mind Imitation Method.
– It's only an imitation, after all.
195
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,380
– You can't defeat me! You monkey!
– You can't defeat me! You monkey!
196
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,390
That imitating monkey mouth...
197
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,550
I'll make sure that you won't be
able to open it any more!
198
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,660
And…
199
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,960
You judged the right timing when
my frustration was reaching its height
200
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,460
W-What is that?
201
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,600
You set a clever trap.
202
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,260
Me...?
203
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,970
You used the Genjutsu with
your hypnotic eye and
204
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,270
made me weave the signs first...
205
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,540
This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...
206
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,110
The Giant Vortex Jutsu!
207
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,360
R-Ridiculous!
208
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,500
Then that makes it easier.
209
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,170
First vanish into the thick fog,
210
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,900
and make your
perceptive eyes useless….
211
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,140
Huh?
212
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,980
Darn! The guard is falling behind!
213
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,610
I will close my eyes as well!
214
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,180
I will shut off your ability to use
your hypnotic eye
215
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,850
in a close-distance battle.
216
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,720
Why?
217
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,560
That also means that
you will lose your ability to see.
218
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,090
Did you forget...?
219
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,800
That I am a genius in Silent Killing,
220
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,800
a technique to find
the target just by sound.
221
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,750
He read my movement...
No way could he do that.
222
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,650
Darn! We were so close!
223
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,390
Naruto, can you still move?
224
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,660
Of course! I'm totally fine!
225
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,560
He's pretty much spent…
and it's no wonder.
226
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,700
Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of Chakra.
227
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,570
But thanks to him,
I found our way out.
228
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,930
I found the way to break through!
229
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Hah!  Impossible!
230
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,580
That was just a coincidence.
231
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,680
Naruto! Run!
232
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,550
What?
233
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,150
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!
234
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,920
A-All right!
235
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,420
You won't be able to...!
236
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,340
I-I'm not going to lose!
237
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,480
There!
238
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,540
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
239
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,970
Darn!
240
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,540
T-That was good just now!
241
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,540
What?
242
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,980
We're doing it one more time!
243
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,550
All right!
244
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,150
It's likely that there's a limit
to that guy's Chakra, too!
245
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,220
To prove that,
he's little by little…
246
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,600
This won't go as you've planned.
247
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,500
First, I'll get you!
248
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
Sasuke!
249
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,190
Darn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.
250
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,390
And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...
251
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,440
Be calm… Think...
What will he come after?
252
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,640
Oh no!
253
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,260
What?!
254
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,660
Too late!
255
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,530
Why? Why is it?
256
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,540
Why did this happen?
257
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,610
I never asked for your help!
I hated you!
258
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,550
But you…
259
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,550
Darn! I won't forgive you!
260
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,760
Next episode:
"The Broken Seal"
//%
1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,760
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,700
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,970
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,370
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,040
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,780
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,650
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,520
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,790
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,660
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,070
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,440
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,400
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,870
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,450
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,950
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,660
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,660
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,670
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,660
This is a Hidden Village that has produced
many superb Ninjas.
22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,660
– Hey Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?!
– You're really gonna get it this time!
23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,660
The number one prankster of the village,
Naruto Uzumaki,
24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,500
is a boy who is also
striving to become a first-rate Ninja.
25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,670
I don't care!
26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,100
Transform!
27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,780
His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu.
28
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,710
–You fool!
– However, Naruto had a secret inside him.
29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,610
– Stop making idiotic spells!
– that even he didn't know about.
30
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,020
At one time, the nine-tailed fox drove
the Village Hidden in the Leaves
31
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,650
to the brink of destruction…
32
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,660
That nine-tailed monster fox is
sealed within Naruto's body.
33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,640
– Look at that one.
– Therefore, he's been abhorred
34
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,070
– I hear he's the only one who failed.
– as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups.
35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,810
Serves him right.
36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,610
Imagine what would happen
if he becomes a Ninja.
37
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,810
Okay, you may open your eyes now.
38
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,750
Congratulations on your graduation.
39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,960
However, that Naruto,
40
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,020
– Iruka Sensei!
– on my sufferance,
41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,460
– That hurts!
– graduates from the Ninja Academy.
42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Say cheese!
43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,670
He starts off on his first step as a Ninja.
44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,440
Ninja missions are conducted
by three-man cells.
45
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,080
Sasuke Uchiha.
46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,650
A descendant of the Uchiha clan,
47
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,920
a distinguished family in
Hidden Leaf Village.
48
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,650
He is a boy towards whom Naruto harbors
intense feelings of rivalry.
49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,660
Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi who
Naruto has the hots for.
50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,170
As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missions
with these two rookie Ninjas.
51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,170
The one who observes and
instructs them,
52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,640
Kakashi Hatake,
also known as the Copy Ninja,
53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,480
is the Leaf Village's most skilled Ninja.
54
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,920
One day, Naruto's group takes on
the mission to guard Tazuna,
55
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,620
a master bridge-builder
of the Land of Waves.
56
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,560
All right! We're off!
57
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,990
However, Tazuna is targeted by a man
named Gato
58
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,660
who attempts to control
the Land of the Waves.
59
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,830
Stop your darned grumbling…!!
60
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,710
– Next time I'll kill him with...
– And Gato had hired a terrifying man
61
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,480
– head chopper!
– for Tazuna's assassination.
62
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,710
Zabuza Momochi…
63
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,650
A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hidden
in the Mist.
64
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,650
He was a man who had excelled at
Silent Killing and
65
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,850
had successfully carried out
many assassinations.
66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,670
Naruto and the gang have
a tough time of it
67
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,470
in the face of Zabuza's attacks…
68
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,610
Hey! You, with no brows…
69
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,950
Record in your Bingo Book
about the man
70
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,480
who'll one day become
the Leaf Village's Hokage.
71
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,020
Naruto Uzumaki!!
72
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,060
It's not so easy!
73
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,000
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow…!
74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,340
However, the shoe is on the other foot,
75
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,640
thanks to Naruto and Sasuke's
close team work.
76
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,780
Kakashi copies
Zabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan.
77
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,420
– W-What's that?!
– It breaks Zabuza's composure.
78	01:05:42:24	01:05:44:29
Me...?
78
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,020
R-Ridiculous!
79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,830
Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)?
80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,530
The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!!
81
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,900
No way!
82
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,030
It's over…
83
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,670
A Tracker Ninja boy
from A Hidden Mist Village
84
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,810
is the one who delivered
the final blow.
85
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,320
I must get rid this corpse
because it contains many secrets.
86
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,450
Now then, please excuse me.
87
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,430
However, this boy, Haku...
88
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,530
was Zabuza's comrade.
89
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,200
Will you be all right the next time?
90
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,630
The next time…
91
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I'll be able to see right
through the Sharingan.
92
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,440
Kakashi who has inferred
that Zabuza is still alive,
93
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,740
gives Naruto and gang…
94
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,810
– Ready!!
– new training in preparation...
96	01:07:15:05	01:07:17:23
– Here I go!
– for Zabuza's second assault.
95
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,030
And then, 					One week later...
96
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
This mist…
97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,570
Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming!
98
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,510
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
99
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,710
So it seems.
100
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,650
The time has come!
101
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,650
Secret Jutsu…
102
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,090
Crystal Ice Mirrors!
103
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,230
Now then… I'll start.
104
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,900
Take this!
105
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,630
Naruto Uzumaki…
106
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,640
is finally here!!
107
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,640
The Number One Hyperactive,
Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!
108
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,990
Now that I've come, you're all right!
109
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,990
Oh…
110
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,130
Naruto!
111
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,160
The hero of a story generally appears
in this kind of situation
112
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,400
and takes out the enemy in no time!
113
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,040
Heh… That brat, eh…
114
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,110
He's long on talk...
115
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
Man, that idiot!
116
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Making such a conspicuous entrance…
117
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,050
There's no point if you don't
catch the enemy off guard!
118
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,920
That boy…
119
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,660
What're you doing in a place
like this from morning?
120
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,300
Training!!
121
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,500
Why are you training?
122
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,500
I want to get stronger!
123
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,910
All right, here I go!
Shadow Clone Jutsu…
124
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,310
Huh?!
125
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,850
Oh, no!
126
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,050
Huh?
127
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,650
Get out of the way, Naruto!
128
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,520
Whoa!
129
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,620
What?!
130
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,790
He's saved…
131
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,660
To think the enemy attacks
would cancel each other out…
132
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,870
That was super lucky…
133
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,370
Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!
134
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,870
Hey! What kind of idiot
would attempt
135
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,570
to cast a Jutsu directly
in front of an opponent?!
136
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,740
What?!
137
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,410
The essence of a Ninja is deception.
How you deceive your opponent.
138
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,520
Even casting one Jutsu,
you avoid the eyes of your opponents,
139
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,650
catch them off balance,
and outsmart them…
140
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,660
The way you made your entrance earlier,
that's just you coming to be a target…
141
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,930
N-Nooo.
142
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,400
But I went to the trouble
of coming to the rescue.
143
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,330
What concerns me more than that is…
144
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
That guy…
145
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,540
Haku… What's the idea?
146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,150
Zabuza, leave this kid to me…
147
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,080
Please let me fight this battle my way.
148
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,820
What did you say…?
149
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,260
So you mean no interfering…Haku?
150
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,800
You're naive…as usual…
151
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,700
I'm sorry…
152
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,000
Naive, eh…
153
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,870
True enough…
154
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,540
Judging from these wounds,
155
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,910
there's no mistaking that
I was attacked with a Senbon.
156
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,650
But no vital areas have
been targeted so far.
157
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,590
Does he mean to half-kill me…?
158
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,620
If so!
159
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,660
As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!
160
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,200
It's impossible.
lt's too much for Naruto!
161
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,470
I should be the one to…
162
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,270
Hey. Don't get any ideas…
163
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,640
If you move,
164
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,880
you know what'll happen
to that old man, right?
165
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,580
True…
166
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,580
If I move away from here and
head towards Naruto,
167
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,650
Zabuza will kill Tazuna.
168
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,820
No way can Sakura completely
protect him by herself.
169
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,060
How about it?
170
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,330
Let's just see how those young guys
fight against each other.
171
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,670
That mask…
172
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,700
You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,
weren't you!
173
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,940
You've got nerve to deceive us!
174
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,310
I'm sorry.
175
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,580
But, your teacher also said it,
didn't he?
176
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,420
Things like deceiving and
catching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.
177
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,250
Please don't take it personally.
178
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,060
You don't have that luxury, either!
179
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,660
Huh?
180
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,900
Sasuke?
181
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,840
I haven't…forgotten about you.
182
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Here I thought he had disappeared…
but he was there…
183
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,020
I would rather you had
just gone down quietly.
184
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,650
But it looks like it won't work
that way.
185
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,650
Fine. I'll put an end to it first.
186
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,060
H-Hey!
187
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,990
Naruto. I'll get to you later.
188
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,500
W-What's with him…?
189
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,000
This is it!
190
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,650
So the real body is over there, eh…
191
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,650
Okay!
192
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm over here.
193
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,660
He moved…? How?!
194
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,180
– Sasuke! 					– Sasuke!
195
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,350
What was that just now?!
196
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,320
Sasuke's body suddenly got battered…
197
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,590
How's he doing it?!
198
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,160
What kind of Jutsu is he using…?
199
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,700
It's conceivable that he has clones
hide in the mirrors and
200
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,340
gets them all to throw
the Senbons simultaneously…
201
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,640
No, they're too fast considering…
202
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,910
What does it mean...
203
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,670
not being able to see even
the trajectory of the weapons…?
204
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,780
Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu…
205
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,650
I don't see a reason for
these ice mirrors…
206
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,160
In any case, there's no way to question
that these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.
207
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,370
What I can do is to launch attacks…
208
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,700
from both the outside and inside.
209
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,870
The thing to do is to figure out
the meaning of the mirror!
210
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,940
I'll take care of here!
211
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,320
All there is to do is…
212
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,620
for me to attack the inside and have Naruto
try attacking the mirrors from the outside.
213
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,420
Yo! I came to save you.
214
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,460
You okay, Sasuke?
215
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Oh…
216
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,270
What good will it do you
to catch your ally off guard…?
217
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,770
Y-You idiot!
218
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,770
If you're a Shinobi,
you'll move more cautiously!
219
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,510
What's with you?!
220
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,640
I came to the rescue, you know!
221
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,440
If you also come inside the mirrors…
222
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,210
Dang it! I've had it, you fool!
223
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,650
Fool?
What do you mean by fool?!
224
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,120
As to be expected of the
number one unpredictable Ninja.
225
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,620
He is making the situation worse and
worse by coming to aid.
226
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,660
Since it's come to this,
all that is left is to smash the mirrors!
227
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,000
Fire Style!
228
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,900
Hey! What're you going to do?!
229
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,840
These are mirrors made
with freezing water…
230
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,170
If so…
231
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,010
Fireball Jutsu!
232
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,620
It's not working at all!
233
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,760
They won't melt with that
level of firepower.
234
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,640
Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!
ls it the clones?
235
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,080
Where's the real body?!
236
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,250
It's useless for you to even
attempt following with your eyes.
237
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,650
I absolutely will not be caught.
238
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,660
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
239
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Don't!
240
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,460
If so, I'll find out which is
the real body by hitting them all!
241
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,560
This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses
mirrors that can reflect only my image.
242
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,790
Watching you from the speed I move,
243
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,700
it almost seems as if
you aren't moving at all…
244
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,030
I knew it!
245
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,900
Is that Jutsu…the Kekkei Genkai?!
246
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,640
Kekkei…Genkai…?
247
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,640
It's the same type as my Sharingan…
248
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,850
Deep blood ties…
Lineage of paranormal individuals…
249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,650
A type of Jutsu that is passed on
only through those traits…
250
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,020
Then…!
251
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,420
That's right…
252
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,660
It's impossible even for me
to copy that Jutsu…
253
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
And there's no way to destroy
that Jutsu, either!
254
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,170
Darn it…
255
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,170
So…what?!
256
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,710
I can't die here yet.
257
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,650
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality…
258
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,280
The dream to have my strength recognized
by everyone in the village…
259
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,850
and become the Hokage!
260
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,350
Dream…
261
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,610
Pathetic brat.
262
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,820
Brats like you aren't needed
by anyone
263
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,620
and die without ever knowing
any freedom or dreams…
264
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,600
You have the same eyes as I do…
265
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,410
For me, becoming a Shinobi completely
is difficult.
266
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,640
If I can, I don't want to kill you guys…
267
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,650
And I don't want to get killed
by you guys…
268
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,850
But if you guys are
going to come at me…
269
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,190
I'll kill my feelings with a sword and
completely become a Shinobi.
270
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:51,090
This bridge is the battleground
that connects each of us to our dreams.
271
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,400
I, for the sake of my dream.
272
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,070
And you, for the sake of your dreams.
273
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,770
Please don't hold it against me…
274
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,170
I want to protect the person dear to me…
275
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,610
I work for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,
276
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,980
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality…
277
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,020
That's my dream.
278
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,620
For the sake of the dream,
I will completely become a Shinobi...
279
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,190
and kill you guys!
280
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,900
Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!
281
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,200
Cuz' I've finally discovered the way
to break through it!
282
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,270
Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.
283
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,640
Let's pull out of this place and
go assist Kakashi Sensei.
284
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,980
I've had this bad feeling from
a while ago.
285
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,480
Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehow
until we get there.
286
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,620
Next episode:
"Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters."
287
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,260
As for me, I'll kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,220
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,120
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,000
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,170
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,210
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,050
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,420
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,750
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,560
We now start the second test
of the Chunin Exam!
20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Look for the brats!
21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,360
Those three, right?
22
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,300
All right! Let’s go!
23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,350
Okay! First we search for that thing.
Can you do it, Hinata?
24
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,420
Yes.
25
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,420
Slow down, Lee! We just started.
26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,190
I know. But…
27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,990
I can’t stay still!
28
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,600
Who knows what kind of
powerful foe is waiting for us?!
29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,270
As you already understand,
we have only one target!
30
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,440
It sounds like they’ve already started.
31
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,910
Huh? That was someone’s
scream just now, right?
32
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,950
I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,560
I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it!
34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,560
I-I have to pee.
35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Y-You… Fool!
36
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,740
What are you doing in front of a lady!
37
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,340
Go to the grass!
38
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,240
Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest
39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,150
Oh…! Ohhh...!
40
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,230
Aaah… that was a lot!
41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,030
Feels much better!
42
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,070
C’mon Naruto! I told you not to say
things like that in front of a lady--!
43
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,740
What?!
44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,940
S-Sasuke…
45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,540
no matter what,
you don’t have to go that far.
46
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,250
W-What was that for?
47
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,420
Where’s the real Naruto?!
48
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,380
Huh?
49
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,890
I don't know what the heck
you’re talking about!
50
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,730
What happened to the scratch
you got earlier from the Proctor?!
51
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,100
And…your Shuriken holster
is on your left leg.
52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,370
That guy’s right-handed.
53
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,010
You’re worse at transformation
than Naruto, you phony!
54
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,710
Unlucky me! In that case...
55
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,550
Which one of you got  the scroll?!
56
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,720
Since things have come to this,
I’ll resort to force!
57
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,550
Fire Style:
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
58
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,000
Heeeey! Sasuke!
59
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,100
You’ve got to be kidding, loser.
60
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,570
All right!
61
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,940
I caught you off guard! Lucky!
62
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,140
Paper Bomb…!
63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,610
This is lucky!
64
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,320
I’ll kill you if you move!
Calmly hand over the scroll!
65
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,250
Sasuke!
66
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,590
I won’t let you get away!
67
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,700
Y-You’re always late Naruto!
68
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,070
Absorption with my Chakra.
69
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,880
Sasuke…
70
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,850
Don’t just stand there, Sakura!
71
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,720
No guarantee this guy's alone!
72
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,590
Got it?!
73
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,630
If you let your guard down
you’ll really get killed…
74
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,660
It’s unlucky! I came on my own
to conceal my presence,
75
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,370
but that became my enemy…
76
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
He got away, huh…?
77
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,550
If there’s an instance that
we become separated,
78
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,250
don’t trust him if he looks
like your teammate.
79
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
Just like now there’s a possibility
80
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,220
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!
81
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,960
– Yeah. 					– So what do we do?
82
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,560
We’ll decide on a password.
83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,930
Password?
84
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,100
Listen, if the password is incorrect,
no matter what he looks like…
85
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,410
presume he is an enemy!
86
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,340
I’ll only say it once, so listen closely.
87
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,450
You ask,
Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”
88
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,550
And the answer is this:
89
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,320
“The chance to sneak up when a large
number of enemies are making a scene.
90
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,260
“The quiet place has no secret hideout.
91
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,860
“It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.
92
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,960
“The time when an enemy is tired
and drops his guard.”
93
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,260
That’s it.
94
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay!
95
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,900
Could you say it again?
96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,170
Huh?!
97
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,170
I told you I’d only say it once.
98
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,440
Could it be that you couldn’t memorize it?
99
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,540
– You fool! 					– Huh?!
100
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,510
I got it right away!
101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,650
I-I memorized it perfectly!
102
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,390
I thought just in case,
I’d listen one more time…
103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,320
I’ll carry the scroll!
104
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,730
Hey, wait Sasuke.
105
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,860
Ouch!
106
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,600
What is it?
107
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,140
A new enemy?!
108
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,490
You guys go play around …
109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,590
I’ll go alone…
110
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,540
Sakura!
111
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,810
Sasuke!
112
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,070
Don’t come closer!
113
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,810
First the password…
114
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,810
Ninja song, “Ninja Chance”!
115
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,480
Ah! Umm…
116
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,180
The chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.
117
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,750
The quiet place has no secret hideout.
118
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,420
It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.
119
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,720
The time when an enemy is tired
and drops his guard.
120
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Good.
121
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,560
Owwww!
122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,630
Hey everyone, are you okay?
123
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,300
Naruto, wait!
124
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,570
The password…
125
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,730
I know…
126
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,670
The chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.
127
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,540
The quiet place has no
secret hideout.
128
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,110
It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.
129
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,610
The time when an enemy
is tired and drops his guard.
130
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,750
– What?! 					– Huh?!
131
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,750
What are you doing?!
132
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,190
This time it’s someone who
can dodge my attack, huh?
133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
What are you saying, Sasuke?
134
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,560
Naruto just said
the password properly.
135
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,570
He was able to say it,
that’s the problem!
136
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,500
– Huh?! 					– Wha--?
137
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,540
Do you really think that guy can
remember a password that long?
138
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,570
Oh!
139
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,010
If we asked the normal Naruto
what the password is,
140
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,550
what do you think he’d say?
141
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,550
“Sorry. I’ve forgotten it.”
142
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,050
Besides, his movements when
he avoided my attack…
143
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,060
It was clearly different
from Naruto’s!
144
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,860
Show your true self already,
fake one!
145
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,770
That’s how it is, huh…
146
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,550
But if you knew he would forget it,
147
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,190
why didn’t you make
the password shorter?
148
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,520
I knew that you were
underground
149
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,560
eavesdropping on
our conversation.
150
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,100
So I chose that password on purpose.
151
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,070
Oh really. So you’re not tired
or letting your guard down.
152
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,110
This will be more fun than I thought.
153
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,350
This person’s…too creepy!
154
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,180
And where’s Naruto?
155
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,260
Huh?
156
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,320
Owww!
157
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,560
And heave!
158
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,930
Huh? Where are Sakura
and that Sasuke?
159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,440
H-Huge!
160
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,510
This is the first time I’ve seen…
a snake this huge!
161
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Behind?!
162
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,560
T-Tail!
163
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,050
You want our Earth Scroll,
don’t you?
164
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,820
‘Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.
165
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,730
Well, let’s begin…
166
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,540
the battle for the Scrolls.
167
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,710
Life or Death!
168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,010
Genjutsu?!
169
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,180
No, that's not it.
170
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,450
This is simply
a thirst for blood.
171
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,560
What’s going on?
172
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,430
Just looking at her eyes
made me think of death.
173
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Who is this…woman?!
174
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,570
Sa…kura…?
175
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
It’s no good.
176
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,090
We have no choice but to flee here.
177
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,960
Unless we do, the only thing
waiting for us is…
178
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
Death!
179
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,870
Let me out! Hey!
180
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,570
Spit... me... out!
181
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,180
Darn!
lt’s not going to work.
182
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,010
Something else...
183
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,380
Oh!
184
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,820
The rice ball I took for lunch!
185
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,390
Huh?!
186
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
It’s dissolving!
187
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,370
I’ll be digested just like
that rice ball eventually…
188
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,270
N-No!
189
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,980
Let me out! Let me... out!
190
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,920
Can’t move already...?
191
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,250
She’s going to kill me!
192
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,720
Move…move…move…!
193
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,890
Move!
194
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,300
Move! Move!
195
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,070
Move!
196
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,950
Even if it’s just a little…
Move!
197
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,490
What do you intend to do... with that?
198
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,420
I can’t move!
199
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,560
Don’t worry.
I’ll end this in a second.
200
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,130
You won’t even have
the time to feel pain.
201
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,750
I wanted you to entertain me more.
202
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,550
It’s too bad.
203
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,570
Am… I going to die here?
204
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,540
Iruka Sensei
205
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,550
Old Man Hokage…
206
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,390
Konohamaru...
207
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,560
Kakashi Sensei.
208
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,230
Sakura.
209
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,070
Sasuke.
210
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,480
A lot happened between him and me.
211
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,550
Even though we always squabbled,
212
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,650
we cooperated and saved Kakashi Sensei
in that encounter with Zabuza.
213
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,820
During our Chakra training in forest,
214
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,460
we competed each other and
practiced climbing up trees.
215
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,070
That’s it! I haven’t…
216
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,570
settled things with him yet!
217
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,940
– More rice! 					– More rice!
218
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,050
If this creature doesn’t want to
spit me out …
219
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,980
I’ll make it to do so at any cost!
220
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,170
I see.
221
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,060
Sasuke!
222
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,100
He wounded himself
at the last moment…
223
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,070
Move. Move. Move. 					Move...!
224
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,340
Move!
225
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,620
He wiped out the fear with pain.
226
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,930
As expected,
he’s not the average prey.
227
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,530
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
228
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,710
I...am a Shinobi who
will become Hokage!
229
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,150
I won’t put up with being
snake dung in this place!
230
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,360
Sasuke.
231
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,800
Are you okay?
232
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,540
If we don’t flee in a hurry,
we’ll be discovered here, too.
233
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,810
How do we flee…?
234
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,440
How should we escape…?
235
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,650
I’ve never seen Sasuke…
236
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,310
so worked up.
237
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,860
Sasuke, a snake!
238
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,100
Shoot! I was too shaken up
to notice the snake!
239
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,510
Don’t come near me!
240
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,110
Don’t lower your guard,
not even for a moment…
241
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,850
A prey must always stay tense
and try to flee desperately...
242
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,850
before a predator.
243
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Ahh... Huh?!
244
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,510
Sorry Sasuke..
245
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,550
Naruto!
246
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,020
The password… I forgot it!
247
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,130
Hey, can you hear it?
248
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:35,410
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
249
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:44,880
The ocean spans limitlessly
250
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:53,260
Please keep that smile on your face forever
251
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,200
Or else I’ll cry
252
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,070
You won't have to search around you
253
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,600
It’s all ok now.
254
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:16,550
Everyone is inside
this hand
255
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,020
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
256
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,560
When you forget what happiness is
257
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,390
Just sing.
258
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,630
Light is born, and darkness was born
259
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,970
The two are one
260
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,440
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
261
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,950
Hey, can you hear it?
262
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,550
Hey, hey , hey!
263
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,420
It looks like you bullied
weaklings while I was gone.
264
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,360
That explosion and
that huge snake,
265
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,060
it's all your fault, isn't it?
266
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,400
You darn snake bastard!
267
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,540
Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki, is here,
I'll wipe the floor with you!
268
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,540
Next episode: "Naruto's Counterattack:
Never Give In!"
269
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,810
Look forward to my kicking butt!
//%
1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,700
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,450
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,250
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,490
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,580
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,040
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,490
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,000
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,450
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,450
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,660
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,330
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,160
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,790
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,250
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,080
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,410
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,830
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,370
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,450
The End of Tears
21
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,200
By special…
22
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,490
By special,
you meant that?!
23
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,490
I don’t feel like I’m gonna lose.
24
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,000
Sasuke…you…
25
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,620
If they continue to be released
for a long period of time,
26
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,580
Curse Marks will progressively
eat your body.
27
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,370
When they have entirely
eaten you…
28
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,290
you will lose yourself…forever.
29
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,490
This body…
30
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,330
It looks like there’s no time to waste.
31
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,580
I don’t have any feeling
in my left arm…
32
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,950
That power you have…
33
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,500
seems to involve
some risks too, huh?
34
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,120
Did you know…?
35
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,490
That this place…
36
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,790
is called the Final Valley.
37
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,490
I think this is the perfect stage,
don’t you think…Naruto?
38
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,830
Oh yeah…
39
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
I said there’d be
no more talking, didn’t I?
40
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,410
Well, in that case,
how about we bring it to a close…?
41
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,540
This battle.
42
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,200
All our battles up to now!
43
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,620
Next for Squad Seven.
Naruto Uzumaki!
44
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,160
Sakura Haruno!
45
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,200
Yipeee!
46
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,080
With Naruto…?
47
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,410
And Sasuke Uchiha.
48
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,000
Yipeee!
49
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,120
With Sasuke…?
50
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,290
Try not to slow me down, loser.
51
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,540
You…!
52
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,490
But…but…but…you told us…
53
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,200
That’s why they……
54
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,330
Aren’t we a three-man squad?
55
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,120
That’s right! We three are one!
56
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,410
Hey!
57
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,490
Are you hurt? 					Scaredy Cat?
58
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:34,080
Hey…are you hurt?
Scaredy Cat?
59
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,080
You are one of the ones
I want to fight.
60
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,870
Sasuke!
61
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,490
I want…to fight you, too.
62
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,490
I don’t want to see
any more deaths
63
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,490
of my precious comrades.
64
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,490
Summoning Jutsu!
65
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,490
I…will protect Sakura!
66
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,490
What’s so funny?
67
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,660
Nothing’s funny, believe it!
I'm happy!
68
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,490
When I think I can finally
beat you here!
69
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,290
What did you say?!
Don't talk foolish, you failure!
70
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,080
I’m not going to be
a failure forever!
71
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,040
Just bring it, now!
72
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,160
Put on your headband before that!
I’ll wait.
73
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,490
I don’t need such a thing…
74
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,120
Just do it!
75
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,660
You wouldn’t even be able
to put one wound on my forehead!
76
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,200
You’re wrong!
77
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,490
I’m saying this is a testament
78
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,870
to fighting on equal terms
as a Leaf Shinobi!
79
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,490
Naruto!
80
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,620
Sasuke!
81
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,750
I’ll win no matter what!
82
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,870
Don’t flatter yourself!
83
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,540
Stop it!
84
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,790
And from this time onward…
85
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,660
Chidori!
86
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,200
Rasengan!
87
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,160
– Rasengan! 					– Chidori!
88
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,490
– Chidori! 					– Rasengan!
89
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,080
This Chakra…
90
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,490
This isn’t good!
91
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,330
Naruto…
92
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,450
I…
93
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,490
It’s started to rain!
Will it erase the scent?
94
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,490
No problem.
95
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,870
We’re already close.
This way.
96
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,910
Was I too late…?
97
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,870
Naruto!
98
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,870
Why did things come to this?!
99
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,200
This is Sasuke’s…
100
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,490
I didn’t make it in time…
please forgive me.
101
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,830
Naruto…
102
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,330
I know the kind of person you are…
103
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,910
You must have made
a desperate effort.
104
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Sasuke…
105
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,040
That’s my boy…
106
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,910
With me, you’re all
your father talks about…
107
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,490
You are my one and only brother.
108
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,490
I will continue to be for you…
109
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,290
a wall that you must find
a way to cross over.
110
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,580
Even if you were to hate me…
111
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
You are someone
112
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,490
who can obtain Mangekyo Sharingan
just like me…
113
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,450
However, on one condition.
114
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,000
Your closest friend…
115
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,910
The Final Valley…
116
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,620
To think that Sasuke and Naruto
would battle it out here…
117
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,490
How ironic…
118
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,290
Yeah…
119
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,160
When I look at
the flow of this water,
120
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:28,490
it’s as if I’m being confronted
by an eternal, never-ending battle…
121
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,910
Just like the fate of the two people
depicted in these statues here
122
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,120
who founded the Village Hidden
in the Leaves…
123
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:49,490
Naruto and Sasuke,
as long as you both live…
124
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,660
You have to kill…
125
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,290
your closest friend!
126
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,490
I'm not gonna…
127
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,490
abide by everything you say!
128
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,540
I will get my hands on power
doing it my own way!
129
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,790
I will surpass you
doing it my own way!
130
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,490
Without fail!
131
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,490
The rain’s…let up, hasn’t it?
132
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,870
Yeah.
133
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,580
With that much rain,
134
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,830
I won’t be able to pursue
the scent anymore.
135
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,370
Naruto is more important now
than pursuing Sasuke.
136
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,290
Yeah.
137
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,750
It’s gotten interesting, hasn’t it?
138
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,490
Yeah…
139
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,580
When I recalled the parts one by one,
140
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:35,040
I felt as though
I had understood everything
141
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:45,500
Faded words which I kept so close to me
142
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:55,450
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
143
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,200
and this distant yearning for you
144
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:11,490
I live, simply repeating this cycle
145
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:23,200
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
146
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:33,500
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
147
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,410
I’ll keep these thoughts…
148
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,290
I’m sorry.
I’m really sorry, Sakura.
149
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,250
I made a once-in-a-lifetime promise
that I would bring Sasuke back.
150
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,120
But, I’m not finished yet!
151
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,250
I’ll fulfill my promise,
no matter what!
152
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,490
Since that was what
I was always saying…
153
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,250
that I won’t go back on my word.
154
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,410
That’s my Way of Ninja!
155
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,490
Next episode:
“The Promise That Could Not Be Kept”
//%
1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,490
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,450
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,000
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,500
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,250
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:46,120
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:55,490
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:06,370
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:15,700
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,870
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,490
Our mission this time around
is a rough one.
12
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,910
Can you do it, Lee?
13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,910
I’ll be okay! I can go anytime.
14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,870
Now that’s my protégé!
15
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,750
Let’s go, Lee!
16
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,580
Right, Guy Sensei!
17
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,490
They’re off!
18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,330
Those large bags no doubt mean
an overnight expedition mission.
19
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,830
To think we’d encounter the ideal pair
so quickly. We’re lucky.
20
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,370
Then, it’s settled.
21
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,000
Right. Starting operation.
To infilrtra… whoa!
22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,790
H-Heavy! Get off, you idiot.
23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,830
To…infiltrate…the super elite
hidden village…
24
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,490
the Village Hidden in Leaves!
25
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,490
The Appearance of Strange Visitors
26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,040
Wow, we look just like those two!
27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,040
Naturally. We refined
our Disguise Jutsu for this very day.
28
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,750
We’re after the classified information
of the Leaf…
29
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,450
Right!
30
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,870
We’ll be famous if this goes well!
31
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,540
The idea is to win distinction
for our village.
32
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,290
Then we’ll get tons of missions
and we’ll be the village heroes!
33
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:27,490
Village Heroes!
Mondai and Poccha!
34
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,700
All right. As of this moment,
my name’s Guy.
35
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,830
The Leaf Ninja, “Mondai Guy”!
36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,450
And I’m the protégé, “Poccha Lee”!
37
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,750
Let’s go, Lee.
38
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,490
Yes, Guy Sensei!
39
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,490
Nothing like a large village,
sure enough!
40
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,950
Wow, everyone’s like a Ninja.
41
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,450
Hey! Don’t be looking all
about so much!
42
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,330
Oww…
43
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,250
Listen up.
44
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,500
There’s a chief in this village
called the “Hokage.”
45
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,700
So there’s no doubt classified information
is concentrated where that person is.
46
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,750
I see.
47
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,370
If I remember correctly,
48
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,750
that person’s in a building easy to spot
with a “Fire” mark on it or something…
49
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,830
– There it is! 					– That’s it!
50
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,080
What about the Lady Hokage’s house?
51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,290
– Yikes! 					– Yikes!
52
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,290
Hi.
53
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,490
N-Nothing special! We’re not after Leaf
classified information or any-any-any…
54
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,790
Are you an idiot?!
55
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,490
I-It’s nothing at all!
56
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,830
Is that so?
57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Look, we’ve got to act naturally here.
58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,330
R-Right…
59
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,370
Hi. I’m Guy.
60
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,490
I’m Lee.
61
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,120
Guy and Lee…, eh…?
62
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,620
Don’t you guys have
a different atmosphere than usual?
63
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,040
No. I-It’s your imagination!
64
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,370
No, I feel like something’s different…
65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Oh, there’s a kite up there flying
while eating a pork cutlet rice bowl!
66
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,370
What? Where, where?
67
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,580
What? There’s no kite anywhere.
68
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,250
Hey, what?
69
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,580
Jeez, that Ninja has to go and
stand behind us
70
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,450
without any sign of his presence.
71
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,120
But it seems we fooled him good.
72
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,490
Our Disguise Jutsu is perfect,
sure enough.
73
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,870
Say, infiltration is kind of easy, isn’t it?!
74
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,910
The Leaf isn’t worth fearing!
75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,790
Guy and Lee imposters are
prowling around the village?
76
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,000
And to think they’d enter the village
in disguises
77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,700
without even using Transformation Jutsu.
78
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,580
Are they really Ninja?
79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Weird people find their way
in when a village grows.
80
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,490
Well, it’s nonsense, but I thought
I would at least report it for now.
81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,490
Indeed, we can’t just leave
intruders unchecked.
82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,250
Shall we throw them out?
83
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,490
No, leave them be.
84
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,040
What?
85
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,490
It sounds interesting, doesn’t it?
86
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,080
They’re going to the trouble of
calling themselves Ninja of this village.
87
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,040
But…
88
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,120
We probably don’t need to worry.
89
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,790
It’s unlikely that anyone could be
fooled by such obvious imposters.
90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,290
Come on, please.
Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
91
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,490
Pretty please with sugar on top!
Just the one day today would be fine!
92
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,660
Let me join your training!
93
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,410
Hey! What’s with this guy
all of a sudden?
94
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,500
He’s probably a real acquaintance
of theirs, but…
95
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,700
Does he think
we’re going to do training?!
96
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,250
I’ll do anything! I’ve always
been interested in Taijutsu.
97
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,450
I mean…okay?! It’s okay, right?
98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,490
Anyway, let’s turn him away!
99
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,000
Right!
100
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,490
No. Take a pass.
101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,490
What? Why?!
102
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,370
Because our training is very harsh,
rough and difficult.
103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,830
Difficult training, huh…?
104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,490
Ahhh, I’m getting even
more fired up! Please!
105
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,750
I won’t get in your way,
no matter what! Come on.
106
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,490
– Absolutely not!
– Absolutely not!
107
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,950
All right, since it’s come to this!
108
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,620
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
109
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,490
Real body clones?!
110
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,490
– And furthermore…
– And furthermore…
111
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,490
– Harem Jutsu!
– Harem Jutsu!
112
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,870
Wh-What?!
113
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,910
– What?! 					– What?!
114
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,200
– Pl-ea-se. 					– Pl-ea-se.
115
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,700
– Okay! 					– Okay!
116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,620
What?!
117
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,490
Yes!
118
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,120
– No way. 					– No way.
119
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,790
Brother, why’d you say okay?
120
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,040
What’s done is done,
so it can’t be helped, right?!
121
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,620
Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee!
122
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,370
What’s the deal, you two?
123
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,620
We’re going to the farm today, right?
124
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,160
Farm?
125
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,330
What’re you doing letting
your mind wander?
126
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,290
The person’s waiting.
Come on, hurry!
127
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,870
– Huh? Oh… 					– H-Hey!
128
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,040
Hey, wait!
129
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,080
– What…? 					– Huh?
130
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,790
I promised to plant rice for
the sake of training?
131
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,620
Not only that, all of this…
132
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,250
It’s totally huge.
133
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,910
Gee, thanks. It’s a big help,
you guys giving me a hand.
134
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,500
Please don’t worry about it.
135
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,490
They accepted this on
their own accord, so. Bye.
136
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,490
Why is this training?
137
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,490
I get it!
138
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Indeed, I will use my body quite
a bit if I do this training.
139
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,160
So I can get in shape
while helping out, huh?
140
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,660
Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
141
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,410
I’ll do my best!
142
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,040
Why’s he that motivated?
143
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,540
Why should we have
to do this manual labor…?
144
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,830
Damn it.
Anyway, let’s get this over with!
145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,870
You’re right.
146
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,410
Th-That’s mean, brother!
147
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,160
Oh, sorry about that.
148
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,410
What?
149
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,490
Poccha?!
150
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,160
Come to think of it, there are
flying leeches  in the rice fields,
151
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,490
so be careful.
152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,160
F-Flying leeches?!
153
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,790
Worst-case scenario, it could be deadly.
154
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,580
Yikes.
155
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,950
Hey Poccha!
156
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,410
Hang in there!
157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,490
Just what I’d expect of Taijutsu training!
158
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,500
That was some intense rice planting!
159
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,910
Phew, that was a good workout!
160
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,500
W-We’re done…
161
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,490
Th-That was life or death…
162
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,370
Then, shall we move on?
163
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,750
– A manure receptacle?!
– A manure receptacle?!
164
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,490
Spread this in that field over there.
165
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,490
Th-This is also training…?
166
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,950
H-Heavy…Smelly…
167
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,410
Why should I have to do
something like this…?
168
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,950
Hey, you guys,
why don’t you walk straight?
169
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,000
Y-You can walk twice
the forward progress distance
170
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,490
if you move ahead while
walking left and right like this!
171
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,790
Oh, so that was it?
172
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,250
Then I’ll also…
173
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,790
Like this?
174
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,290
I-It’s really hard to balance like this!
175
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,490
D-Damn it!
176
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,660
Gee, I didn’t realize at all that
there was a method of training like this…
177
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,080
Hey! Watch it.
Walk more over there…
178
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,830
What’d you say?
179
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,370
What a nightmare.
180
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,910
Forget about it.
Anyway, let’s lose the kid right now.
181
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,370
As for you guys,
you still kind of smell bad.
182
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,540
– Shut up! 					– Shut up!
183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,490
There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee.
184
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, Sakura.
185
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,250
Oh, Naruto. You’re here, too?
186
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,700
As for me,
I’m training together with these two today.
187
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,330
R-Really?
188
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,330
More importantly, is something up?
189
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,490
Yeah… Actually, I really wanted
your help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee.
190
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,490
– What? 					– What?
191
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,660
– Your laundry blew away in the wind?
– Your laundry blew away in the wind?
192
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,450
That’s right.
lt got caught in a bit of a high spot.
193
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,490
No. No way, no way.
We’ve got lots of work to do, so.
194
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,490
Come on!
195
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,490
Here I’m asking precisely
because it’s you guys.
196
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,490
Please don’t say no!
197
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,290
Sakura, if you’re in that much trouble,
I could get it for you!
198
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,490
Okay, Guy Sensei?
199
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,490
Okay?!
200
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,490
Sure.
201
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,250
What a sheer cliff.
202
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,000
That’s for sure. We’d be beyond help
if we were to fall from up there.
203
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,490
Right? I don’t quite have the confidence…
204
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,450
That means…
205
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,700
Yup! It’s right above here.
206
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,290
Gee, as one would expect,
I don’t think we could…
207
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,160
Isn’t that great, Sakura?
208
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,490
For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this is
no different than a flat path.
209
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,330
That’s encouraging.
210
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,370
It’s a big help having an awesome Ninja
like you close by, Guy Sensei.
211
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,700
What? Uhh… Umm…
212
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,290
Now, please.
213
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,490
Brother…
214
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,410
Damn it. Why is this happening?!
215
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,200
I-I don’t want to die.
216
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,580
D-Damn it!
217
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,450
Hey, as for you guys,
why aren’t you using the Chakra suction?
218
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,490
Th-This is training for building up
muscular strength!
219
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,370
So that’s what it was?!
220
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,490
Just what I’d expect of a Taijutsu user.
221
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,490
I never came up with deliberately
draining physical strength!
222
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,910
I really do learn a lot from
being with you, Sensei.
223
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,660
Th-This jerk…
224
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,120
I’m…I’m going to die…
225
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,870
Alley-oop!
226
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,490
No!
227
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,490
Th-That was close…!
228
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,490
Gee, sorry about that.
229
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,490
This jerk…
230
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,490
All right, we made it.
231
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,750
Don’t look down!
232
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,950
Anyway, if we can just take
this back with us…
233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,370
Alley-oop…
234
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,250
Damn it…
235
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,490
All right, I got it.
236
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,830
It won’t come loose…
Hey, help me out here.
237
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,290
R-Right…
238
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,450
You little…!
239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,410
Sensei, use suction with your Chakra!
240
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,660
This is nothing to me!
241
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
Look out!
242
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,950
For real? What?!
243
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,660
Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
244
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,490
I’ve had it…
245
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,750
Sensei, Bushy Brow!
246
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,490
That was awesome!
247
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,910
To do something like not
using Chakra suction. Awesome!
248
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,370
– Look you…! 					– Look you…!
249
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,290
Perfect timing, you guys.
250
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,830
Old Lady Tsunade.
251
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,490
Actually, I’ve got something
I want to ask you guys to do.
252
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,620
My companion suddenly started
not feeling well, you see.
253
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,700
– Yikes! It’s huge!
– It's huge!
254
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,870
It seems she’s caught a cold.
255
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,250
It’s a huge slug. Oh, as for this,
is it something like Chief Toad?
256
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,870
Well, that sounds about right.
257
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,660
However, as you can see,
we can’t carelessly move her.
258
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,490
Sorry, but could you guys look
after her for a while?
259
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,490
I’m very sorry.
260
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,490
Jeez. What a ridiculous guy.
261
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,490
Brother, at this rate we won’t be able
to look for the confidential information.
262
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, that’s right.
263
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,490
Shut up.
264
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,490
What’re you moaning about?
265
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,490
You guys.
266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
It couldn’t be that you guys
267
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,410
can’t listen to the words of me,
the Hokage, could it?
268
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,490
– This is the Hokage?
– This is the Hokage?
269
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,910
This is bad. To think the Hokage
was that fierce a person.
270
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,410
We’re taking care of
her precious companion.
271
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,870
We might be able to get into
the Hokage estate surprisingly easily.
272
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,370
I wonder.
273
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,490
So even Summoning animals
get sick, too…
274
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,830
It seems to be a light cold.
275
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:17,200
My nose itches, I have a sore throat
and I feel weak or something…
276
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,700
Hey, I’m going to chill your forehead!
277
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,700
Thank you so much.
278
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,000
All right, here we go.
279
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,410
Oh…Oh no. The itching…
280
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,200
What?!
281
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,490
– Wha--! 					– What?!
282
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,160
It’s… It’s melting…
283
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,950
Watch it, you!
284
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,410
I’m very sorry. I’ll be more caref--
285
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,540
Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
286
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,490
You’ll be in danger if you don’t
move away from there!
287
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,540
My…My lower back…
288
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,290
Y-You idiot!
289
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,790
I’m developing my dynamic vision
for narrowly evading danger!
290
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,750
Wha--?
291
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,160
That Sensei,
292
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,910
he was training, putting his life
at risk even at times like this…?
293
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,160
Even though that Bushy Brow guy’s
training properly, as for me…!
294
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,370
I’ve woken up,
Guy Sensei, I’ll train with you!
295
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,490
Let’s do this!
296
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,080
Ohh, the joints in my body hurt…
I feel like I’m going to fall apart…
297
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,160
Hey! Aren't you a slug?
What’re you doing talking about joints?!
298
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,120
– S-Save us. 					– S-Save us!
299
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,490
I’ve had it.
What’s going on with this village…?
300
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,000
I’ll die if I stay in a place like this
any longer.
301
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,750
Withdraw…
302
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,000
Right.
303
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,580
Who’re you guys?
304
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,790
Why are you dressed like
my protégé Lee…?
305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Damn it!
306
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,500
Since it’s come to this,
I don’t give a damn anymore!
307
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,910
– Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
– Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
308
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,660
I don’t really get it, but it seems
we just have to fight, huh?
309
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,120
So it seems.
310
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,490
Let’s go, Lee!
311
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,750
Now, knockout technique!
312
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,250
– Double Dynamic Entry!
– Double Dynamic Entry!
313
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,330
Damn it. What did we go there for
in the end?!
314
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,700
I really hate, I really hate…
315
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,660
– the likes of the Leaf!
– the likes of the Leaf!
316
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,490
Tamaya!
317
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,910
Lord knows where they came from,
318
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,580
but now they’ll probably never
want to try that again.
319
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,830
You sure looked like
you were having fun, Lady Tsunade,
320
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,490
going so far as to summon Katsuyu.
321
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,700
Well, my adorable Genin
helped out as well, so.
322
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,870
Now, we’ve had our breather.
So please be getting back to work.
323
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,370
Oh yes, ma’am.
324
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,370
But still…
What was with that Naruto?
325
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,160
To think he seriously believed
those two were for real.
326
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,500
What was that all about?
327
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,490
Who knows…?
328
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,080
Hey!
329
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,790
Naruto.
330
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,410
– Someone who looked just like me now…
– Man, you guys got separated.
331
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,080
I didn’t know what to do.
332
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,660
As for me, I was impressed!
333
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,490
– You guys were really cool earlier!
– Huh?
334
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,620
I’ve learned of the intricacies of Taijutsu
or something…
335
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,750
A lot happened, but I’ll continue
training right away!
336
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,950
Continue training?
337
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,540
So come on, let’s continue
the Taijutsu training!
338
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,540
Moron, moron, moron.
339
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:41,540
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
340
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:53,250
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
341
00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:04,490
What dreams did you chase to get here?
342
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:16,660
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
343
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:28,200
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
344
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:39,620
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
345
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,490
I’ll be close to you
346
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,580
Damn it! Why should a Ninja have
to do something like get rid of a ghost?!
347
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,080
We have no choice, right?
After all, a commission is a comission!
348
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,200
The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?!
Th-That’s ridiculous!
349
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,490
But they say it comes out at night!
350
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,910
A ghost warrior clad in a white armor!
351
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,160
N-No, I’m not afraid of it at all!
352
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,700
H-Hey! Behind you!
353
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,040
No!
354
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,490
I knew it! You ARE afraid!
355
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Next time: “The Cursed Warrior”
//%
1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,580
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,490
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,120
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,620
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,370
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:46,250
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:55,490
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:06,490
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:15,830
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,000
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,910
Hasn’t this increased
since last month?
12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,290
Yes, it has.
13
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,660
It’s now widely known
in distant lands
14
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,490
that you were appointed to Hokage,
Lady Tsunade.
15
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,580
Bills have started to come in addressed
to the Village Hidden in Leaves.
16
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,200
Hokage is not something to take on.
17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,410
My name is Tsunade…
18
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,000
I’m the Fifth Hokage of
the Village Hidden in Leaves.
19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,490
My concern now is a debt
that absolutely will not go down…
20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,830
And…
21
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Grandma Tsunade!
22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,250
– Hey wait! 					– Naruto!
23
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,490
– Lemme go! 					– Calm down!
24
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,490
If there aren’t any missions,
let me go search for Sasuke!
25
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,490
You’ve been told to train,
haven’t you, Naruto?!
26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,490
Grandma Tsunade!
27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
That…
28
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,330
The Treasure Hunt is On!
29
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,490
I won’t let you through!
30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,790
Goal!
31
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,410
Too bad.
32
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,120
But it’s totally obvious since
it’s the same person doing it.
33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,580
There haven’t been
any missions lately, either.
34
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,490
I wonder if the Pervy Sage will
come back soon…
35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,910
I can’t train by myself…
36
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,250
What, there was someone here
before me?
37
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,370
Huh? Kiba… Akamaru…
38
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,370
Here I thought I could take
my time to train.
39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,290
Are you by yourself?
Where are Hinata and Shino?
40
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,490
Shino is backing up another team
with Kurenai Sensei…
41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,700
Hinata said she’d train at home.
42
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,950
Is it like we’ve lost our jobs?
43
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,160
Don’t say that…
I’ll feel empty-hearted…
44
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,080
Naruto! Kiba!
45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,620
Hinata…
46
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,160
Weren’t you training at home?
47
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,540
There was a call from the Hokage.
She wants us to come immediately.
48
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,490
Then…
49
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,870
All right! Our first mission in a while!
50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,490
Treasure hunting?
51
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,490
That’s right. This person here,
an old acquaintance of mine,
52
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,790
is our client this time around…
53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,830
My name is Agari Kaisen.
54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,490
Please look at this.
55
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,830
This is a map indicating
the location of the treasure.
56
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,370
It seems a treasure worth several
hundred million ryo lies buried there.
57
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,540
S-Several hundred million?!
58
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,540
If I were to eat Ichiraku’s
special portion ramen everyday…
59
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,370
I don’t think you could eat all that
even if you spent your whole life eating…
60
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,950
Awesome!
61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,330
But it’s on the map, right?
62
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,490
Is this a job to go to the trouble
of asking Shinobi to do?
63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,490
Yes. The treasure is in a location
difficult for ordinary people to get to.
64
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,660
Even I tried getting there…
but there was no way.
65
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,870
So it’s the Shinobi’s turn, huh?
66
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,500
The deadline is in three days.
67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,580
If you succeed, there will be
a special reward from Agari.
68
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,490
Set out with caution!
69
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,580
– Yes! 					– Yes!
70
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,750
Heh! A mission like this is a cinch!
71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,370
Indeed, it isn’t a difficult mission.
72
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,250
However… if you fail…!
73
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,950
– What?! 					– What?!
74
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,870
– Yay, yay! 					– Hey, wait!
75
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,290
If you fail…
76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,120
you will go back to the Academy!
77
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,620
– What?! 					– What?!
78
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,490
You’ll re-enroll in the Academy
79
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,830
and re-do your Ninja training
from square one.
80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,660
Wh-Why us…?
81
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,870
I looked up your mission success rate
over these past few months…
82
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,750
Naruto! You’re decisively poor!
83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,830
What?!
84
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,490
In particular, the success rate
when you team up
85
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,040
with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyuga
is hopelessly low!
86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,490
Now that she mentions it,
87
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,950
it’s the members we failed
an earlier mission with…
88
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,000
We also failed before when
four of us, including Shino,
89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,910
went looking for Bikochu Beetles…
90
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,490
Something rings familiar, right?
91
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,290
But, just Naruto aside,
92
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,330
why should we also have
to go back to the Academy…?
93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,330
Collective responsibility is fundamental
in Ninja teams.
94
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,700
Everyone takes responsibility
for a failure.
95
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,000
Got it?!
96
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,200
It…it’ll be okay. No way should we fail
at hunting for treasure…
97
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,910
If you don’t drag us down.
98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,490
What?! Don’t you be dragging us down!
99
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,830
If we fail… we’ll have to study
with these kids, right…?
100
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,660
Hey, what’s up?
101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,660
Naruto, Kiba, Hinata,
all three of you together?
102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
Iruka Sensei…
103
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,910
You guys must have come
to miss the Academy, huh?
104
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,450
You could come back if you like.
105
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,700
I’ll never go back!
106
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,490
What’s with them…?
107
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,580
I’ll make this mission a success
no matter what
108
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,450
and put Grandma Tsunade
to shame!
109
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,910
And I’ll have no part of
going back…
110
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,490
to the Academy on account
of associating with you.
111
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,490
The failures until now
are a collective responsibility.
112
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,700
It’s not just my responsibility!
113
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,000
I don’t know about that.
114
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,620
The success rate of our team
without you in it is high.
115
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,490
Then I’ll prove on this mission
116
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,370
who it is who really drags us down,
believe it!
117
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,910
That’s just what I want.
118
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,950
I wonder if this will be okay?
119
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,200
It’s a dead-end!
120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,750
So this is as far as
there’s a path, huh…?
121
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,620
There’s a river up ahead.
How should we cross it…?
122
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,160
Then, here here.
We should cut straight through, right?!
123
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,040
Are you an idiot?
Mountain terrain isn’t that simple.
124
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,830
I would go…this way.
125
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,250
Are you an idiot?
That’s totally the long way around.
126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,950
Then you want to compete
to see which is faster?
127
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,500
No way will I lose!
128
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,910
All right! The finish line
is that boulder!
129
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,330
Start! Let’s go, Akamaru!
130
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,040
This will be a cinch!
131
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,200
What? What?
132
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,200
Wait, Naruto!
133
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,000
Naruto…
134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,950
What?
135
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,290
It seems we’re climbing up
quite a bit…
136
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,290
It’s okay!
137
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,790
Naruto!
138
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,080
It’s…okay.
139
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,250
We should be totally faster than Kiba, so…!
140
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,120
Yes! I win!
141
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,290
Something smells good…
142
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,200
Huh?
143
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,660
So you finally made it, huh?
144
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,040
Kiba!
145
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,370
You were so late I went ahead
and got some food ready…
146
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,700
Now then… which way?
147
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,450
We should…
we should just cut right though this!
148
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,350
Naruto!
149
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,100
Good grief…
150
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,600
W-Water…
151
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,180
Here, water.
152
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,720
This way’s definitely faster!
153
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,050
I sure slept well.
154
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,850
Akamaru and I often
train in mountains like this…
155
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,350
We know a lot more about
the mountains than you guys.
156
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,590
Shut up!
157
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,260
Shut up, I say!
158
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,510
Don’t be acting all big just because
you won two or three times!
159
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,390
Not two or three times.
Five times!
160
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,510
S-Stop it! Naruto! Kiba!
161
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,220
Naruto and the others
should be there pretty soon, huh…?
162
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,220
This mission looks easy at a glance.
163
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,850
But it won’t go that easily…
164
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,590
They’ll probably realize that.
165
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,590
A limestone cave, huh…?
166
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,760
But…
167
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,590
Geez, hurry up already!
168
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,970
You said the buried treasure is
in a limestone cave, right?
169
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,050
Just a minute!
170
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,180
The limestone cave is supposed
to be further ahead.
171
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,430
We shouldn’t have been able
to find it this easily…
172
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,260
It’s not like there are
that many limestone caves!
173
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,180
So here’s fine…
174
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,430
Let’s go, Hinata.
175
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,550
R-Right…
176
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,180
H-Hey, wait, you two!
177
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,430
I can’t see anything…
178
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,220
Oh, it’s a dead-end…
179
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,680
It can’t be!
180
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,890
Naruto! Hinata!
181
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,850
Look out! Run, you two!
182
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,590
Wha--?
183
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,550
This…couldn’t be over…
184
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,260
That person said it’d be okay
at just this extent…
185
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,510
What happened…?
186
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,220
By any chance,
was an enemy after us?
187
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,140
No…Akamaru’s saying
he didn’t smell anyone.
188
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,590
It was probably just an accident…
189
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,390
I told you this wasn’t the right place!
190
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,220
But, as a person,
if you’re looking for a limestone cave
191
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,590
and there’s one right in front of you,
192
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,720
one would usually think
that’s the place, right?!
193
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,180
Don’t be getting smart with me.
Here I saved your butt!
194
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,470
I didn’t ask you to save me.
195
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,600
What?!
196
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,300
Hey… you two…
197
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,590
A shard from the ceiling
hit you, huh…?
198
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,600
You okay?
199
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,590
It seems I’m the one
dragging us down…
200
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,260
Not at all!
lf I had been more cautious…
201
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,720
At the end of the day,
it’s your fault, Naruto.
202
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,600
Kiba!
203
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,590
Nevertheless, I’ll have no part of
going back to the Academy
204
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,720
on account of associating
with you, Naruto…
205
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,470
Akamaru and I will find the treasure.
206
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,590
What’re you saying, Kiba?!
207
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,970
There’s no point if
we don’t all do it together!
208
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,590
I’m…okay, so…
209
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,350
From here on, there will be locations
all along the way so rough
210
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,680
they are beyond comparison
to those up until this point…
211
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,590
It’ll be nothing but places that
really only a Shinobi can get through!
212
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,680
It’d be absolutely impossible
for someone with an injured leg.
213
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,850
Oh…
214
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,760
Besides… we can’t just leave someone
who’s injured, right?
215
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,140
We need someone to stay with her.
216
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,390
Then it doesn’t have to be me…
217
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,800
Can you find the treasure by yourself?
218
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,640
You can’t read a map worth a damn
and you don’t know the mountains…
219
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,300
To be straight…
220
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,800
we’ve wasted a ton of time
on your account, so!
221
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,930
Rest easy.
222
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,260
After I find the treasure,
223
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,590
you won’t have to go back
to the Academy…
224
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,260
Let’s go, Akamaru!
225
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,140
H-Hey! Wait, Kiba!
226
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,970
Damn it…!
227
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,350
Now.
228
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,850
Naruto!
229
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,590
Huh?
230
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,350
Are you awake, Naruto?
231
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,550
Hinata…
232
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,800
Naruto!
233
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,260
There are…two Hinatas!
234
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,640
Naruto…
235
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,800
Naruto…
236
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,300
Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu?
237
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,430
Could it be… you were twins?!
238
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
– No! 					– No!
239
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,720
Then…
240
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,300
One of you transformed into Hinata
with a Transformation Jutsu, huh…?
241
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,140
I can’t…tell you apart at all…
242
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,760
I’m the real one!
243
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,590
I’m the real one!
244
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,050
Your voices are also
exactly the same!
245
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,590
I know.
246
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,300
At a time like this,
247
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,680
I should ask a question
that only the real one knows.
248
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,800
I'll come right out and ask!
What’s Hinata’s father’s name?
249
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,050
– Hiashi Hyuga.
– Hiashi Hyuga.
250
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,640
Oh, yeah. As for me,
I didn’t know Hinata’s father’s name.
251
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,760
What?!
252
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,100
– Naruto… 					– Naruto…
253
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,300
At a time like this,
if Kiba and Akamaru were here…
254
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,800
Here they could tell by smell
which one is the real one…
255
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,590
Nope. It’d be impossible even
for a Ninja Hound…
256
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,390
What?
257
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,350
This isn’t just an ordinary
Transformation Jutsu, so…
258
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,550
Mister…As I recall,
you’re the client this time around…
259
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,970
What are you doing here?
260
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,590
It wasn’t buried treasure that I wanted…
261
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,590
It was your faces.
262
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,590
Faces…?
263
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,590
I already got…your face…
264
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,430
I’m Naruto Uzumaki!
265
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,590
That’s…me…
266
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,050
I guess I’ll be setting out
to get the last face…
267
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,760
Leave it to me!
268
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,100
This is the place…
269
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,590
This inside of the cave
is as the map says…
270
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
There’s no doubt.
271
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,590
It’s under this rock, huh?
I’ll go in one shot!
272
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,680
Huh?
273
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,890
This, huh…?
I found it surprisingly easy.
274
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,600
What is it, Akamaru?
275
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,800
Kiba? That’s you there, isn’t it, Kiba?
276
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,510
Kiba…?
277
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,590
Naruto…Hinata…
278
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,850
I told you guys to go
on back first, didn’t I?!
279
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,010
Come on! Come on! Here we went
to the trouble of coming!
280
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,300
This mission is for the three of us, so…
281
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,590
Hinata… is your injury okay?
282
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,680
Yeah…I became able to move
after resting a bit, so…
283
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,720
Wow! You already found
the treasure?!
284
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,390
Then let’s take it back
to the village quick!
285
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,720
Right…
286
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,470
Wait… How did they get here
so fast without a map?
287
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,850
And moreover,
Naruto has zero sense of direction…
288
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,600
And Hinata has an injured leg…
289
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,220
Akamaru…doesn’t seem to be feeling
any particular suspicion.
290
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,430
Am I being paranoid…?
291
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,100
It seems they’re back.
292
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,510
Kiba! Akamaru!
293
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,850
Heh! Didn’t we tell you?
294
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,970
Even a Ninja Hound's nose
can’t tell the difference…
295
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,590
Let’s begin.
296
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,550
Face Copying Jutsu!
297
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,970
What’s that…?
298
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,300
We also copied faces like this.
299
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,180
As you can see,
300
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,010
when performing
the Face Copying Jutsu,
301
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,590
the person being copied
must be close by.
302
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,050
And moreover,
it takes a degree of time.
303
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,220
But once a face has been copied once,
it’s an impeccable Transformation Jutsu
304
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,680
that is beyond even
a family’s recognition.
305
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,300
No way…
306
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,640
Kiba! Wake up! Kiba!
307
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,010
Wh-What the hell are you…?!
308
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,720
I’m Kiba Inuzuka.
309
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,590
You guys…
310
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,600
What’s the big idea?!
311
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,930
Kiba!
312
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,890
Kiba!
313
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,720
Those are the real ones, huh…?
314
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,600
Who the hell are you guys?
315
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,550
The name of our clan
is the Kedouin Clan.
316
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,590
We’re a clan that possesses
the secret Face Copying Jutsu.
317
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,590
Why our faces?
318
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,430
We’re going to return to the Village
Hidden in Leaves in your place,
319
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,260
and mess up the village good!
320
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,470
The wind blows, Ah…
321
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,220
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
322
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,720
What should be brought along?
323
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,720
Assemble them into a piece.
324
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
There is no second chance, never
325
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,510
How foolish it is to throw away
326
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,600
Acting so innocently, Ah…
327
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,590
The images.
328
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,590
It probably will not end
329
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,010
It probably will not end
330
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,760
Burn that love-filled heart,
331
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,850
Sail across a thousand dreams
332
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,890
Running freely
333
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,590
To take hold of the world in hand
334
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
The clouds scatter
335
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,590
The sun sets yet again
336
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:36,260
The solo parade begins to move.
337
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,590
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
338
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,970
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
339
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,010
Like I said,
340
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,930
nothing good ever comes from
a mission together with you, Naruto.
341
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,140
This isn’t the time to be complaining.
342
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,430
They’re intending to
head for the village.
343
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,220
Then, how do we get out of here?
344
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,590
– Listen.
– With Rasengan, I’ll…
345
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,800
No good. They’ll notice.
346
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,590
– I can…
– Then use your Fang-Over-Fang.
347
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,180
– It’d be the same, you idiot.
– That's why I said…
348
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,640
– Then, what do we do?
– Use that, I’m telling you…
349
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,590
Naruto!
350
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,760
– Don’t stop me, Hinata.
– Don’t stop me, Hinata.
351
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,680
Not that, I mean I’ll…
352
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,430
– Oh, that. 					– Oh, that.
353
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,590
Next time: “Run, Dodge, Zigzag!
Chase or be Chased!”
//%
1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,060
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,270
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,440
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,100
Yahoo!
13
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,890
Roar and Howl!
The Ultimate Tag-Team!
14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Got you!
15
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,890
Damn!
16
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,350
What’s going on?!
17
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,600
I felt a response to my attack,
but it didn’t work.
18
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,940
And where did his attack
come from?
19
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,020
Listen, Akamaru.
20
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,100
We’re gonna attack from both sides
with Fang Over Fang.
21
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,230
Here we go!
22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
Fang Over Fang!
23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,600
Summoning Jutsu!
24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,850
This doesn’t look so good.
25
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,100
I’ll play a melody of death for you.
26
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,440
What’s with this guy?
27
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,480
What?!
28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,940
Two on two is perfect,
right, Sakon?
29
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,900
How could the Sound Ninja Four
take so much time?
30
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,690
Did they send such strong people
after them who could hold them up…
31
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,310
or are they playing around too much?
32
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,060
Well, the one that’s probably
delaying things is…
33
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,060
either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot,
or Kidomaru who likes to play.
34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,350
But the one that’s
the most dangerous
35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,020
when he loses his temper
is Sakon.
36
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,560
He’s not satisfied until
he kills his opponent,
37
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,600
even though he should
just leave things be.
38
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,890
He thinks he’s the strongest of
the four, so he shows off.
39
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,480
I wonder if that’s so…
40
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,440
Tayuya has a personality that’s
neck and neck with Sakon.
41
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,310
But in any case,
nothing bad will happen
42
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,400
since we sent that kid…
43
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,480
Kimimaro.
44
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,890
He’ll surely clean up anything that is
not good for me.
45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,600
I will never let you take Sasuke!
46
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,270
There’s a lot of trash scattered about.
47
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,480
But after all, trash is trash.
48
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,020
It simply needs to be cleaned up.
49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,890
Shut up!
50
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,810
Come on.
51
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,890
I’ll crush you!
52
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,020
So this is the so-called
melody of death.
53
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,440
So she’s manipulating them
with the sound of the flute.
54
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,560
Damn! She’s getting
further and further away.
55
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,230
What should I do?!
What is it that I should do?!
56
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,350
Huh?!
57
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,560
This is really looking bad!
58
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,890
Akamaru!
59
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,400
Oh, so you’re the real one!
60
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,560
Multiple Fists Barrage!
61
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,850
One more!
62
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,690
My brother and I get along very well.
63
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,480
Usually, my older brother Ukon
sleeps inside of me,
64
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,350
but when there’s a fight
he comes out and helps out.
65
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,650
This is this guy’s ability.
66
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,770
Ukon can stick out
his arms and legs, his head,
67
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,230
from anywhere in my body
and attacks or defends.
68
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,810
Like this you see…
69
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,150
Multiple Legs Barrage!
70
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,900
It’s a three-legged kick.
Works well, doesn’t it?
71
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,560
So next, it’s…!
72
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,560
There’s no time to waste, Sakon.
73
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,060
We’ll finish this quickly!
Get into the second state!
74
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,890
All right, all right…
75
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,350
You’re too impatient, bro.
76
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I see, you’re saying those horns
aren’t just for display, huh?
77
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,890
As soon as that right one came out,
78
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,270
his Chakra increased
by several tenfold.
79
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,900
Shoot!
80
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,730
It seemed hopeless before,
but now it’s really bad.
81
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,980
What’s your liking, bro?
82
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,440
In pieces.
83
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,600
So now,
perhaps it’s time to get serious.
84
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,440
I’ll take care of you all at once.
85
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,890
Such confident words!
But those are my lines!
86
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,560
Shoot! These guys are persistent!
87
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,230
But it’s starting to
get clearer to me.
88
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,310
But the problem is
from here on out.
89
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,850
Damn! Am I completely out of hands?
90
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,270
What?! You’re saying
we’re gonna do that?!
91
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,890
No, Akamaru!
92
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,270
It’s too dangerous to do it here
without our comrades!
93
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,150
You understand, don't you?
94
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,480
If we use that Jutsu,
95
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,890
both you and I will use up
most of our Chakra
96
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,310
and won’t be able to move.
97
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,560
If we miss, we’ll die here in vain.
98
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,890
Akamaru…
99
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,890
What a pitiful master I am…
that you had to bite me.
100
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,980
I understand, Akamaru.
101
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,310
Just like you said,
we only have that left!
102
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,400
Wolf Fang Over Fang!
103
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,890
Now, Akamaru!
104
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,310
What?!
105
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,940
Do it well…Akamaru!
106
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,230
Show them the results of the training!
107
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,890
It’s Dynamic Marking!
108
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,020
Playing dirty like that!
109
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,600
All preparations are done!
110
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,890
Inuzuka-Style!
Man-Beast Transformation Combo!
111
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,890
Two-Headed Wolf!
112
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,730
I wondered what it was going
to be and
113
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,890
it turned out to be
a drooling runt of a dog.
114
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,190
What can a dog like this do?
115
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,150
Take this!
116
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,270
Drool?!
117
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,150
Sakon, what’re you doing!
To the right!
118
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,310
Damn!
119
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,190
Wolf Fang Over Fang!
120
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,890
Heh! How’s that!
121
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,890
Wolf Fang Over Fang revolution speed
is too fast.
122
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,980
It’s such an intense high revolution that
even our visibility becomes zero.
123
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,770
Even without direct contact,
flesh is cut…
124
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,850
A direct hit from the blow
and you’re in pieces.
125
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,980
Really…getting carried away…
126
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,890
This is perfect.
We were just thinking of separating soon.
127
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,900
What?! He divided into two people?!
128
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,190
It’s true…
129
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,600
Had we fully received the blow as one,
it would’ve been bad, but…
130
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,730
The real battle begins now.
131
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,270
Damn it…
132
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,890
Yeah… I know Akamaru.
133
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,150
One more shot of
Wolf Fang Over Fang.
134
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,400
The next one is our limit.
135
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,600
We’ll take them down with this!
136
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,600
Wolf Fang Over Fang!
137
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,020
It’s no use hiding!
138
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,850
I told you we don’t chase
with our eyes!
139
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,350
We attack by chasing smells
we’ve marked with our noses!
140
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,650
– A! 					– Un!
141
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,060
– Summoning… 					– Summoning…
142
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,890
– Rashomon! 					– Rashomon!
143
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,270
That’s an impressive power…
144
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,100
To turn Rashomon,
145
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,980
the ultimate shield to protect
Lord Orochimaru into this shape.
146
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,350
But…
147
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,890
– This is the end!
– This is the end!
148
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
Akamaru!
149
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,060
Akamaru…
To protect me, you…
150
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,730
Damn! He did it again!
151
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,480
My eyes…!
152
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,440
Damn!
153
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,270
Damn…!
This time it’s not ordinary piss!
154
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,770
It feels like my eyes are burning
with strong acid!
155
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,690
Where’s the other one?!
156
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,440
Hey…
157
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,060
Who are you looking for?
158
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,600
I’ll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.
159
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,890
This is my ability…
specialized in assassination, of course.
160
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,890
You can’t beat me by
just having a good nose and nails.
161
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,850
You can’t beat my ability!
162
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,890
You know that the Chakra Network
through which Chakra flows
163
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,690
is deeply interwoven with each
internal organ, right?
164
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,020
The Chakra Network is interwoven
in a variety of complicated ways
165
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,690
and is linked to the tissues that
make up each organ.
166
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,190
Also to each cell that makes up
the tissues,
167
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,890
as well as even to proteins,
which are the main component of cells…
168
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,890
At the second state,
169
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,400
I can dismantle or reconstruct these cells
or proteins as I wish by using Chakra.
170
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,350
To put it simply,
171
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,850
I can turn my body into tiny pieces,
enter my opponent’s body…
172
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,190
return to my original form
and come back out.
173
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,940
Akamaru…
174
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,900
I’m sorry… Akamaru…!
175
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,150
We’ve always done things together…
176
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,560
we were together,
always and everywhere.
177
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,150
Yahoo! Good boy, Akamaru!
178
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,730
Yahoo! We’re lucky that the people
who got into our trap had Earth Scroll!
179
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,890
With our luck like this,
we’ll reach the goal first.
180
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,810
Akamaru is frightened
all of a sudden.
181
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,890
He can smell the strength of
an oppoenent’s Chakra.
182
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,060
I’ve never seen him this scared…
183
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,150
The people fighting over there must
be something..
184
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,230
The Seventh Round Battle.
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka.
185
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,890
Hey! First of all, don’t you bring
a puppy in here!
186
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,440
He’ll get in the way of our battle!
187
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,560
Idiot! Akamaru is fighting along with me!
188
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,890
Now then…
189
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,560
Let’s go, Akamaru!
190
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,270
Eat this!
191
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,770
There!
192
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,350
Naruto… I'm taking Akamaru back.
193
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,520
Wh-What?! What did you feed him?
His coating has changed to red!
194
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,310
That’s why his name is Akamaru.
195
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,730
Let’s go, Akamaru!
196
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,730
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art:
197
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,900
Man- Beast Clone!
198
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,900
Let’s go! All-Four….
199
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,350
Jutsu!
200
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,890
An opening!
201
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,690
Take this!
Man-Beast Ultimate Taijutsu!
202
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,890
Fang Over Fang!
203
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,690
Akamaru!
204
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,150
Here, Food Pills.
205
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,150
Akamaru! Human Mimicry Ninja Art!
206
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,310
Fang Over Fang!
207
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,350
However, this one time,
I’m sunk…
208
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,890
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,
209
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,730
and I can even create parts
that are only you.
210
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,480
In other words,
a little bit of a fusion condition.
211
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,020
A sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.
212
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,890
A sharing?
213
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,310
That’s right…and a cruel way
of killing that only I can accomplish…
214
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,890
The gradual scraping away
of just your cells.
215
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
I see.
216
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,310
If that’s the case…!
217
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,890
If I do this, what’s gonna happen?
218
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,890
Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!
219
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,100
Die with me…
220
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,020
For the first time, I spoke to you
221
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,150
And you smiled
222
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,810
For the first time, I was able to speak
223
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,560
In my own words
224
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
225
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,770
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
226
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,350
My clumsy attempts with words
227
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,020
You listened without turning away
228
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,310
No wonder I get carried away by you
229
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:13,400
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
230
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,650
I feel so sad
231
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,600
But…
232
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,940
For the first time, I spoke to you
233
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,980
And you smiled
234
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,890
For the first time, I was able to speak
235
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,890
In my own words
236
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,350
For the first time, I spoke to you
237
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,600
And you smiled
238
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,020
For the first time, I was able to speak
239
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,980
In my own words
240
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,770
For the first time, I spoke to you
241
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,440
What is this guy?
Kekkei Genkai?!
242
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,890
Damn it! I've never heard
or seen this kind of technique!
243
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,890
Despite the fact that
this many are attacking him,
244
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,890
my attacks don't even faze him!
245
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,900
I don't know if it's
the "Five Dances" or what,
246
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,900
but I'll take care of them all!
247
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,810
Next time: "To Each His Own Battle"
//%
1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,060
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,270
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,440
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,150
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:28,940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,440
Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!
13
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,730
Wh-What is that Jutsu?!
14
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,100
Damn it!
15
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,890
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
16
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,890
I’ll win no matter what!
17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,890
Don’t flatter yourself!
18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,900
Stop it!
19
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,270
Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds
20
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,270
It’s a tranquil village as always…
21
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,560
The security sucks.
22
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,810
Humph!
23
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,980
We should just massacre everybody
in such a seedy village.
24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,980
Calm down, Sakon.
25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,890
We haven’t come here to fight.
26
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,890
Shut up, you chicken.
27
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,270
If you’re scared,
28
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,940
you should just go home
and go to bed already.
29
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,890
I’m telling you to calm down, Tayuya.
30
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,150
You understand what
our job is this time, right?
31
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,890
Let’s go.
We escort our special guest.
32
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,100
Stop it!
33
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,440
Damn.
34
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,560
I can’t stop completely.
35
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,890
Kakashi Sensei?
36
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,310
Naruto… That thing you just did was…
37
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,600
What’re you guys doing
up on top of the hospital?
38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,980
You went a bit too far
for just a fight, you two.
39
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,810
That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.
40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,190
It’s the Rasengan.
41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
What’s going on?
42
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,060
How can Naruto use that Jutsu…?
43
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,270
Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?
44
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,890
What’re you doing giving yourself over
to a sense of superiority?
45
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,890
The size of the Chidori there
wasn’t one to be aimed
46
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,060
at a comrade of the same village.
47
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,890
Why such infantile behavior…?
48
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,690
Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi…
49
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,400
Sasuke.
50
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,890
Damn it!
51
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,230
Naruto…
52
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,900
How far will you go…?
53
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,310
Kakashi Sensei…
54
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,850
Whatever happened to teamwork?
55
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,310
Was it you…
who taught him that technique?
56
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,310
I think Naruto is still too young
to be handling that Jutsu.
57
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,560
He could’ve killed Sasuke
had something gone wrong…
58
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,310
Even if it’s a means of resisting
the Akatsuki,
59
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,690
to think you would teach Naruto
that Jutsu…
60
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,810
Right back at you…
61
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,690
That Chidori was also considerably hairy.
62
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,650
But I didn’t think he was
the kind of kid
63
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,520
who’d fire that Jutsu at his comrade.
64
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,690
Or is it that there’s something quite
complicated between him and that kid?
65
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,100
Well, all sorts.
66
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,890
All sorts?
67
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,890
Quite simply, it’s a relationship
68
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,480
like the one between you
and Orochimaru in the past.
69
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,520
I see.
70
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,890
To him, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time…
71
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,520
Well, someone he considers
an equal.
72
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,440
Most likely, he couldn’t take
Sasuke’s cheap provocation.
73
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,350
He’s been chasing him…
74
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,310
Chasing him since the Academy days.
75
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,560
Are you hurt…
76
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,100
Scaredy-Cat?
77
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,480
Sasuke!
78
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,770
I won’t lose to you!
79
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,890
For him, it’s neither you
nor me now…
80
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,900
More than anyone…
81
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,770
he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.
82
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,690
On the other side of the coin…
83
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,020
Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto’s growth
at close range and feels inferior.
84
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,350
To the extent that he thinks
he himself isn’t growing at all.
85
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,190
Scaredy-Cat?
86
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,810
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
87
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,890
Summoning Jutsu!
88
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,440
Naruto has gotten strong…
89
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,690
And Sasuke…
90
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,730
I’m going to kill a certain man,
no matter what.
91
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,190
Revenge, huh…?
92
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,440
I wonder if Itachi
is frustrating that kid.
93
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,560
So Sasuke doesn’t want
to acknowledge Naruto.
94
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,310
If he acknowledges him,
95
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,810
he just might deny himself
up to this point…
96
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,650
Rivalry is a difficult thing.
97
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,890
It’s not a very good trend…
98
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,100
Maybe I’ll do some scolding.
99
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,890
Then I leave Naruto to you.
100
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,890
Well, I have a mission.
And there’s the Chidori thing, too…
101
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,310
Sakura.
102
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,560
It’s okay. Things can go back to the way
they were in the old days again.
103
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,690
Cheer up.
104
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,150
See ya.
105
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,890
Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.
106
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,850
Naruto…
107
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,230
Sakura.
108
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,890
Don’t interfere with us!
109
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,480
You are weak.
110
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,890
Why are you weak?
111
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,060
It's because you don’t have enough…
112
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,560
…hate.
113
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,770
What’ve I been doing…
114
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,230
up until now?
115
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,770
He got a nice look in those eyes.
116
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,310
Shall we go soon?
117
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,600
What do you think you’re doing?
118
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,890
If I don’t do this,
you’ll run away, right?
119
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,150
You’re not the type
to listen quietly to lectures.
120
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,650
As I recall,
that’s Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
121
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,520
Sasuke… Forget about something
like revenge.
122
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,770
What?
123
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,020
Well, in this business
I’ve seen a stink of guys like you.
124
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,770
But the final days of those who speak
of revenge are never good.
125
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,440
They’re tragic.
126
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,940
You’ll only hurt yourself and
agonize more than now.
127
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,100
Even if you succeed in revenge,
all that will remain is emptiness.
128
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,190
Shut up!
129
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,900
What do you know?
130
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,230
Don’t talk to me as if you know!
131
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,770
Well, calm down…
132
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,890
If you like,
133
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,060
shall I go and kill the person
most important to you?
134
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,520
You’ll be able to realize just
how far off you are
135
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,890
on what you just said.
136
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,440
Well, I wouldn’t mind if you’d do that.
137
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,480
Unfortunately, I don’t even have
one person like that.
138
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,020
Everyone’s already been killed.
139
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,940
I’ve lived longer than you have…
140
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,980
The times were not good.
141
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,100
I know all too well
the agony of losing something.
142
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,940
Well, both you and I
aren’t the lucky ones…
143
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,100
That’s for darned sure.
144
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,890
But we’re not the worst, either.
145
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,850
You and I,
146
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,810
we both have already found
dear comrades, haven’t we?
147
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,890
It’s because I have lost
that I understand.
148
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,060
The Chidori is a power…
149
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,560
I gave to you because
you now have something important.
150
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,890
You should know that
it’s not a power
151
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,600
to be used on your comrade
or to use for revenge,
152
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,440
and I’m sure you know
what it should be used for.
153
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,100
Think hard about whether or not
what I’m saying is wrong.
154
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,100
It’ll be tricky with a Shinobi
of that level hanging around.
155
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,600
So let’s wait a bit.
156
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,890
Maybe jerks like you’d be no good.
But I could do it.
157
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,890
I wonder. “Two”
should be ample to rip him apart.
158
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,600
Don’t be butting in all the time,
you clod.
159
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,810
Tayuya, women shouldn’t
use words like that too…
160
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,100
Shut up, fatso.
161
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,940
– More, please!
– More, please!
162
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,310
Wanna head back?
163
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,810
Sure!
164
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,650
We both made it
to the top of the tree.
165
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,890
Sakura.
166
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,850
I have a something to talk
to you about.
167
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,890
I’ll go out on a date with you,
so come along.
168
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,520
Damn it…
169
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,890
Damn it!
170
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,270
The Curse Mark left by Orochimaru
during the Chunin Exam…
171
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,730
Kakashi Sensei said
it was okay now, but…
172
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,440
Master Orochimaru.
173
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,890
You didn’t need to send out
all four members, did you?
174
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:24,600
It seems those kids are all interested
in Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.
175
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,810
To see what extent his power is…
176
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
A contest of strength or whatever,
177
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,190
at this point Sasuke would be
no match for them.
178
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,890
That is precisely why…he will come to me
in search of power.
179
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,650
Who’re you guys?
180
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,480
I’m Kidomaru, the East Gate
of the Sound Ninja Four.
181
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
I’m Sakon,
the West Gate of the same.
182
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,890
I’m Jirobo,
the South Gate of the same.
183
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,850
I’m Tayuya,
the North Gate of the same.
184
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,520
I’m in a bad mood now…
185
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,600
If you wanna continue to fight her,
186
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,190
I won’t go easy on you!
187
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:32,350
Once in a long while, once in a while
188
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,940
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
189
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,230
Look like a mountain
190
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,600
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
191
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,100
The remnants of a person crying
192
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,150
Look like a mountain
193
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,890
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
194
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,890
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
195
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,980
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
196
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,230
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
197
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,560
Look like a mountain
198
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,810
Look like a mountain
199
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,310
Look like a mountain
200
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,650
Look like a mountain
201
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,350
A date, a date!
202
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,890
What do you want to eat, Sakura?
203
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,690
Anything's fine.
204
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,850
At any rate,
Kakashi Sensei's over the top.
205
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,560
I just wanted to fight
Sasuke a little.
206
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,810
But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it,
right about now…
207
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,730
Of course, which of us was stronger
would be settled, believe it.
208
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,480
Listen, Naruto…
209
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,890
Next time:
"An Invitation from the Sound"
210
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,850
I feel uneasy…
//%
1
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,110
Gaara.
2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,650
Kankuro.
3
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,750
Gaara.
4
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,980
Primary Lotus!
5
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,560
Damn it! Can’t hold any further.
6
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,900
You can’t even howl like a loser?
7
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,440
Die!
8
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,770
You’re mine!
9
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,340
Don't you be smiling
before you're going to die!
10
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,850
What?!
11
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,560
Who’re you?!
12
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,670
Heh… It seems
you’re an ally this time…
13
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,180
Who are you?!
14
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,710
A Sand…
15
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
…Shinobi…
16
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,520
…ally of the Leaf!
17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, be careful going home.
18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,410
Okay.
19
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
If something happens again,
I’ll come to your rescue again…
20
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,810
Just let me know, crybaby.
21
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,250
You always say too much.
That’s why girls are…
22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,630
I’ll return the favor twice the amount
from that time.
23
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,550
Hey, Shikamaru.
What’s the matter?
24
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,720
We’ll stand by here for a while.
25
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,420
Stand by?
26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,890
We don’t have time fooling around
in a place like this!
27
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,860
Be quiet for a second, Naruto.
28
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,090
That’s right.
Shikamaru’s got a proper plan.
29
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,570
Right, right.  Naruto, you have to
be sure to obey the leader.
30
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,270
Fine.
31
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,150
Shino, I’m counting on you.
32
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:42,930
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
33
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,690
The distance created between us
became too big,
34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,560
because we were always together
35
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,630
Your honest reply, “See you…”
36
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,400
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
37
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,980
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
38
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:33,920
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
39
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:46,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
40
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,970
I can feel it so close,
41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,210
Our two hearts
42
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,790
Sand Alliance with the Leaf Shinobi
43
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,570
So, Kujaku? What’s going on
with our pursuers?
44
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,670
Yeah, we went to the trouble of
leaving footprints as we go.
45
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,170
We need them to follow.
46
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,750
It’ll be okay. They’ll be within
firing range immediately!
47
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,650
There are three pursuers.
One of them is Gaara!
48
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,020
As for the extra two, we'll leave one
for each respectively
49
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,860
and deal with them with
One Shinobi, One Kill…
50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
I’ll isolate Gaara and drive him into
the Reverse Scale Position.
51
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,430
I’ll take the first person.
52
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,300
All right, go.
53
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,020
It's not necessary to drive him
into the Reverse Scale Position.
54
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,490
There are only three of them.
I can handle them by myself.
55
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,690
Flying Kujaku Double Edge Sword:
56
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,430
Whirlwind!
57
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,570
What?!
58
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
What is this?
59
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,540
A wind user, huh?
60
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,270
Interesting!
61
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,760
– Splendid.
– Not bad, Temari.
62
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,960
Naturally.
63
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,360
Not half bad.
64
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,640
To think you’d blow away my Whirlwind.
65
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,540
What, you’re still just a kid?
66
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,350
– You guys go on ahead.
– What?
67
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,550
Hey, Temari. You okay with this?
68
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,150
Will you be okay?
69
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,160
Well, we’re fellow wind users.
70
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,890
I should be able to handle her alone.
71
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,690
Hurry, Gaara.
72
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,560
She’s your student, right?
73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thanks.
74
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,230
– I’m counting on you.
– Be careful.
75
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,540
Right.
76
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
You won’t get away.
77
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,840
I’m your opponent.
78
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,440
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu.
79
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,750
Wind Slash.
80
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,360
This wind is…
81
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,490
These double swords alter the wind
at my will to suit the attacks
82
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
and amplify the power to the extreme.
83
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,130
It’s too late to regret.
84
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,240
I only need a little bit of Chakra
as long as I have these swords.
85
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,770
How long can you pesevere with
the limited Chakra you have?
86
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,170
How about testing that out?
87
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Matsuri.
88
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,090
We caught up.
89
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,720
Where are we?
90
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,390
So you’re awake?
91
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,560
Heh. You’re like prey plunged on
a branch by a shrike.
92
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
You’re the bait to lure him out.
93
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,870
What?
94
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,800
Gaara Sensei.
95
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,540
Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.
96
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,550
What?
97
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Darn it.
98
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,340
Did you see that? This is the Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.
99
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,540
You’re just a kid!
100
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,180
I see.
101
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,180
It’s an adjustable sword with daggers
102
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,480
connected by an iron wire
going through the center.
103
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,560
Like a Bamboo Snake?
How nostalgic.
104
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I used one a lot with puppet games
when I was a kid.
105
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,430
It can look like a living snake
depending on how it’s controlled.
106
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,300
But there’s no point
once it’s been identified.
107
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,910
Though we both use Puppets,
compared to mine, it’s just a kid’s toy.
108
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,540
Go, Gaara.
109
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,810
Can I leave it to you?
110
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,110
Yeah. I don’t need your help for this.
I’ll catch up right away.
111
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,550
I’m counting on you.
112
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,050
Now, bring it on. I’ll play with you.
113
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,490
What’re you doing acting tough?
114
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,260
You’ll die if you take me lightly!
115
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,560
That goes for you!
116
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,000
Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk!
117
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Here I go.
118
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,420
That’s no good.
119
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,650
Come on, that was too easy.
120
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,100
Too bad. This sword
isn’t just an adjustable sword.
121
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,570
The sword itself amplifies Chakra
in response to my Chakra
122
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,870
and changes into the form of a dragon.
123
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,680
Gaara, I’m sorry.
This might take a little time.
124
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Suiko, you ambush him here.
125
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,150
Draw him into
the Reverse Scale Position. Got it?
126
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,360
Yeah…
127
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,070
You won’t get through here.
128
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,840
Gaara, fight me.
129
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,710
Very well.
130
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,510
Bring it.
131
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,300
Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we
going to stay like this?
132
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,540
Shut up. There are many difficulties
with ambushes.
133
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,840
Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata
are taking on those difficulties for us.
134
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,680
What? They are?
135
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,050
Did you find them?
136
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Byakugan!
137
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,940
In that direction, right?
138
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,570
Byakugan!
139
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,420
Got it. There are three battle areas.
140
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,940
It’s the scent bag of
the female Parasitic Insects.
141
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,170
With this, the insects will find you
no matter where you go.
142
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,580
Right. I’m counting on you, Shino.
143
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,810
Then, we’ll be going on ahead.
144
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,550
Be careful!
145
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,020
Oh, information has arrived.
146
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,250
I was getting sick of waiting!
147
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,250
All right, I’m counting on you guys.
148
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,260
This is bad.
lt’s already begun.
149
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,570
All right, Kiba and Choji,
you take the western forest.
150
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,540
Ino and I will take the northeastern hills.
151
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,110
Naruto and Lee, you take
the northwestern forest.
152
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,980
We’ll take on back-up
in two-man cells.
153
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,050
Now then, let’s begin
the favor-returning operation.
154
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,150
– Right. 					– Right.
155
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,550
I was waiting for this time!
156
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Scatter.
157
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,570
What is it?
158
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Hold up.
159
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,070
If the guys who are fleeing will take on
pursuers with One Shinobi, One Kill,
160
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,940
the battle area not being
a straight line means…
161
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,850
Could it be a Barrier?
162
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,320
What?
163
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,550
Just to be safe.
164
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,800
That should do it. Let’s go.
165
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,230
Right.
166
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,820
Now, there’s nowhere left to hide.
What will you do?
167
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,390
To think she’d evade all of my attacks.
168
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Since it’s come to this, I’ve just got to
use that technique!
169
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Wind Style: Sea Dragon!
170
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,340
What’s that? Nothing’s happening.
171
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,550
How pitiful. It seems the wind
doesn’t like you.
172
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,550
I don’t know about that.
173
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,560
The wind is my friend.
174
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,880
This battle is just starting.
175
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,520
Wind Reversal!
176
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Die!
177
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,770
Darn it! Hey, let go!
178
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,540
Done already? I thought
we could play a little more…
179
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,220
That’s the spirit!
180
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,460
What kind of toy is it this time?
181
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,380
That’s funny. You think you can
defeat me with junk like this?
182
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,550
The junk is your sword.
183
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,970
What?! A three-headed dragon!
184
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,880
You’re just quick to escape, eh?
185
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,680
Darn it.
186
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,520
Sure enough,
Crow is at a disadvantage
187
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,920
unless teamed up with Black Ant.
188
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,540
Not bad, Gaara of the desert.
189
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,310
How much Chakra is built up
in that sand?
190
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,510
You want to test that out?
191
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,250
However…
192
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,880
It’ll be in exchange for your life.
193
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,260
Sand Coffin!
194
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,110
Impossible.
195
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,420
That’s a nice sand bath.
196
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,550
You, the sand’s Chakra…
197
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,090
Exactly. This armor sucks up Chakra.
198
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,730
Aw, is this good night?
199
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,570
Just sleep as is! For all eternity!!
200
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,210
What?!
201
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,360
That was a close shave,
202
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,360
but Shadow Possession Jutsu
was a success!
203
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,130
Die already!
204
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,470
Uh, oh!
205
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,810
What?
206
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
You guys.
207
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,560
Who are you?
208
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Who are you guys?
209
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,230
– An ally of the Sand.
– An ally of the Sand.
210
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,570
– Leaf Shinobi.
– Leaf Shinobi
211
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,330
Believe it!
212
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
He’s not here!
213
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,000
– They're further ahead.
– Right!
214
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,270
Guys, fight as much as you want.
215
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,010
I don’t see any Chakra abnormalities
in the basin…
216
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,550
There’s no Barrier.
217
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,890
Good luck, guys.
218
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,450
I’ll protect you.
219
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,240
Gaara Sensei.
220
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,550
Just wait, Gaara!
221
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,550
We’ll return the favor, no matter what.
222
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,460
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
223
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,630
Will always be smiling right near by
224
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,540
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
225
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,150
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
226
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,050
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
227
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,890
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
228
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,860
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
229
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,230
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
230
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,570
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
231
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,050
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
232
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,920
The wind is probably testing our hearts
233
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,250
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
234
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,430
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
235
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,260
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
236
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,900
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
237
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:44,070
Will always be smiling right near by
238
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,050
Damn it.
This was their aim from the start.
239
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,550
To think they would take advantage
of the terrain.
240
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,560
Damn. At this rate,
Gaara will be in danger.
241
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,100
That’s been said,
we can’t move from here.
242
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,130
Please hurry, Naruto, Lee.
243
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,470
You two are the only ones
who can help Gaara now.
244
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,900
Next time:
“Sealed Sand: the Counterattack!”
//%
1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:14,130
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,780
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,650
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,760
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,500
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,070
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,110
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:17,660
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,160
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,400
Our two hearts
11
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,000
Sure enough, I just can’t get
into training by myself.
12
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,050
As for the Pervy Sage…
13
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,580
I wonder what he’s doing and where?
14
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,060
And what happened to him
watching my training?! Damn it!
15
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
What’s she doing?
16
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,320
Wow, are you painting a picture?
17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,900
Huh?!
18
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,770
There’s nothing like rain clouds
in the sky.
19
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,650
Wha--?
20
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,810
The Hokage’s house!
21
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,950
Hurry! Get a move on.
22
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,920
Water, water, water!
23
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,790
Right away!
24
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,560
– Water Style!
– Water Style!
25
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,190
– Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
– Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
26
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,530
Whoa! You idiots.
Not me, up on the roof!
27
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,000
We’re very sorry!
28
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,640
Right, keep it up.
29
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,380
Yes, ma’am!
30
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,690
As I thought, the thing I had feared
has happened…
31
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,560
Kurenai's Decision:
Squad 8 Left Behind
32
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
There she is.
33
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,210
Hey! Wait up!
34
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,550
Giving us trouble.
35
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,420
Let’s hurry up and take her back.
36
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,560
Right.
37
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,730
Hey, wait!
38
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,960
What’re you guys doing?!
39
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,400
Anbu Black Ops?!
40
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,100
Naruto Uzumaki,
leave this place immediately.
41
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,170
Huh?!
42
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,710
As for her, what’d she do?
43
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,640
It doesn’t concern you.
44
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,850
Listen up. Don’t breathe a word
of what you saw here.
45
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,820
Knock it off! Just a minute!
46
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,150
Don’t get in our way!
47
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,160
Oh! They vanished…
48
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,200
Damn it! What’s going on?!
49
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,100
Oh, important documents are soaked.
50
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,040
This will have to be dried in the sun.
51
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,770
I’ll take them outside.
52
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,870
Thanks.
53
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,640
‘Morning.
54
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,650
Oh, Kurenai Sensei.
55
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,010
Is the Fifth Hokage in?
56
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,950
Yes.
57
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,460
So? Is there no change to your sentiment
about pulling out of Squad 8?
58
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,290
No.
59
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,640
Think about it carefully.
60
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,510
Kiba, Shino, Hinata…
61
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,940
You’re the one who recommended
those guys lacking in experience
62
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,610
for the Chunin Exam.
63
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,780
You don’t care about them?
64
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,650
But I must not leave that
problem unresolved.
65
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,490
It’s my responsibility, so…
66
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,560
That incident was no fault of yours.
67
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,570
If the Anbu Black Ops are involved,
then is she a considerably bad person?
68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,070
Or was she involved in some kind
of significant incident?
69
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,540
What did you say?!
70
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,580
Calm down, Kiba.
71
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,110
Kiba, Hinata?
72
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,980
Hey, Shino. Say that again!
73
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,950
Very well. I said it’d be futile.
74
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,560
How dare you say something like that…!
75
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,190
Cut it out!
76
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,160
Naruto.
77
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,660
Calm down. What the hell’s wrong?
78
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,640
We in Squad 8 were left high
and dry by Kurenai Sensei.
79
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,370
Huh? What do you mean?
80
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,640
You see, Sensei spoke to us
directly about it.
81
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,980
My duty is completed.
82
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,290
You will probably be provided with
another Jonin in charge eventually.
83
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,520
Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.
84
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,790
Sensei…
85
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,660
It’s written in stone.
86
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,900
Our relationship is just that of
commander and subordinate.
87
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,230
It’s just the team formation changing
as circumstances demand.
88
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,440
And that was that.
She didn’t even give us a reason.
89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,040
That was that?
Are you guys going to accept that?
90
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,310
Hell no! That’s why I’m saying we should
march into the Hokage’s office and
91
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,450
protest why she is removing
Kurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!
92
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,450
Then this Shino says…
93
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,320
I’m saying it’s futile.
94
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,290
It’s because this might be something
she herself decided on.
95
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,560
Pig-headed jerk…!
96
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,330
Hinata, what do you think?
97
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,670
I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay
as our Jonin in charge…
98
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,900
But…
99
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,370
But what?!
100
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
Kurenai Sensei might have some kind
of reason of her own…
101
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,350
Umm…
102
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,280
So you’re the same as Shino, huh?
103
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,620
No… Kiba!
104
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,490
Just stop fighting already.
I’ll do something about this.
105
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,220
Naruto, you’re not even on this team.
106
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,490
What’re you going to do?
107
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,160
Leave it to me.
108
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,760
I won’t let Kurenai Sensei quit,
no matter what.
109
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,880
I blurted out that they can leave it to me,
but I don’t know.
110
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,310
Hm?
111
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,280
Kurenai Sensei.
112
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,480
What’s she doing?
113
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,790
All right, I should ask her directly.
114
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,790
Umm, Sensei.
115
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,600
Naruto.
116
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,000
I heard from Kiba and the others.
117
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,270
What?
118
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,640
Don’t give up being in charge of Squad 8.
119
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,810
They’re really depressed.
120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,910
That’s why you went to
the trouble of coming?
121
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,650
Yeah. It seems they really revere you.
122
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,350
I don’t know what you heard
from those kids,
123
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,650
but I can’t do that.
124
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,090
I don’t deserve to.
125
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,290
Deserve?
126
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,960
Please tell them all for me.
Tell them I’m never coming back.
127
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,960
Sensei.
128
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,230
Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.
129
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,570
Since it’s come to this,
I guess I’ll try Grandma Tsunade directly.
130
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,090
Naruto.
131
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,490
Sakura!
132
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,460
What is it?
133
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,660
Kurenai Sensei says she’s going
to quit Squad 8,
134
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,460
so I’m going to try asking
Grandma Tsunade directly.
135
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,030
I think that’d be useless… Probably.
136
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,670
It’ll be okay.
137
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,870
As for me, I know the place where
she keeps her alcohol hidden,
138
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,710
so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune…
139
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,580
What I meant was that she must have
some good reason for quitting.
140
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,650
What? What? By any chance,
do you know something, Sakura?
141
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,310
Huh?
142
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,120
You know something, right? Tell me.
143
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,620
No, don’t know anything.
144
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,660
Come on, tell me!
145
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,690
You’re a pest.
146
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,130
Would I ever do something like eavesdrop
on someone’s important talk?
147
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,860
What? You eavesdropped?
148
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,600
Yikes!
149
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,430
You idiot. Don’t talk so loud!
150
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,540
Yakumo?
151
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,780
Yeah. If I remember correctly,
that’s what she said.
152
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,980
I am at fault for letting Yakumo
become like that.
153
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,920
No, I’d say instead that she was
fine up until now
154
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,320
because I put her in your custody…
155
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,860
Shizune, how’re the
nursing arrangements?
156
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,190
A three-man team consisting of
157
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,300
two Medical Ninja and
one Anbu Black Ops member
158
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,170
are keeping a 24-hour watch over her
in a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.
159
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,840
Even so, you can’t rest easy?
160
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,240
No.
161
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,080
I want to take responsibility
in my own way.
162
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,710
Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning…
163
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,650
The conditions are spot-on.
164
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,950
What was the girl’s name again?
165
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,050
Yakumo.
166
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,960
Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura.
167
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,490
Hey, Naruto.
Don’t tell anyone I said anything!
168
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,560
Yeah, I know.
169
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
If that girl is Yakumo,
170
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,910
then she might know something
about Kurenai Sensei.
171
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,040
Lee, you are not stepping in
deep enough.
172
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Right.
173
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,080
Kurenai Yuhi.
174
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,090
I make this request with full confidence
175
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
that you are the best practitioner
of Genjutsu in this village.
176
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,000
Could you take charge of that girl?
177
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,640
Who’s this girl?
178
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,440
Yakumo Kurama.
179
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,180
You know about
the Kurama Clan, don’t you?
180
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,480
Yes.
181
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,820
At one time, they were a clan excelling
in Genjutsu
182
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,650
and were a power in
the Village Hidden in the Leaves
183
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,650
in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.
184
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,660
But they haven’t been blessed
in recent years with talent,
185
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,660
their force has weakened and
186
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,230
they have not been able to
turn out Jonin-class Shinobi.
187
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,430
Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama…
188
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,270
Yes… She’s the only daughter
of the Murakumo of the head family.
189
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,240
She has health issues and is
not enrolled in the Academy.
190
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Then you want me to take charge of her
191
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,210
and train her to be
a practitioner of Genjutsu?
192
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,110
No.
193
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,150
There’s no doubt Yakumo’s latent
Genjutsu powers are excellent.
194
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,520
So much so that those in the clan
195
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,730
put their dreams of rebuilding
the family on her.
196
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,730
Was there some kind of problem?
197
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,170
This is just between us.
198
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,540
Yes.
199
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Yakumo’s parents, Murakumo Kurama
and his wife died, but…
200
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,850
You okay? Don’t push yourself too hard.
201
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,020
I’m okay. I’m fine.
202
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,320
I’m just a bit out of breath.
203
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,690
Listen to me, Yakumo.
204
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,100
A Shinobi is not your only path.
205
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,060
Huh?
206
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,440
You’re a girl and you should
have many other ways to live.
207
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,040
I want to become a Ninja!
208
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,640
I heard there’s a student named Rock Lee
who can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu
209
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,650
striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.
210
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,620
I may not have much physical strength,
211
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,920
but I could become a Ninja if I were to
use that power, right?
212
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.
213
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,230
I’m not a teacher like Guy.
214
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,670
Unfortunately, I cannot train you.
215
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,640
All right, that’s all for today.
216
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,080
Thank you very much.
217
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,110
Take a bath and get a good rest.
218
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,910
Right. Good-bye.
219
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,120
Lee has improved again, huh?
220
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,490
I heard.
lt seems you’re quitting Squad 8.
221
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,330
I have no choice.
222
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,670
Those who develop under me
end up not developing.
223
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,530
It’s not like that.
224
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,040
Although they’re no match for my team,
225
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,010
the growth of the Genin in
your team is striking.
226
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,640
If that’s the case,
it’s not because of my help.
227
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,450
It’s the results of their own efforts.
228
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,080
Hey, Kurenai.
229
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,650
What do you think it is that we can do?
230
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,030
As you say, Lee growing to that extent
is due to his own efforts.
231
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,470
All I did for him was to believe in him.
232
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,640
We believe in our pupils even
at the cost of our lives.
233
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,640
We just need to believe in them
with all our power,
234
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,910
and embrace them with all our power.
235
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,650
It’s not a difficult thing in the least.
236
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,450
Guy, I envy you…
237
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,820
I couldn’t even do something that simple.
238
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,660
Hey, Kurenai.
239
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,160
Believe in yourself!
240
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,940
From where and how are Kurenai Sensei
241
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,980
and that girl from
this morning connected?
242
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,750
It would seem to be worth looking into.
243
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,090
That must be
the Satomi Hill mountain cottage.
244
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,030
Satomi Hill Cottage
245
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,480
The east trap?
246
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,640
So it seems.
247
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,580
An intruder?
248
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,650
Yes.
249
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,650
Kurenai.
250
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,020
Good work on your 24-hour guard.
I came to visit Yakumo.
251
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,690
This late at night?
252
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,300
Yakumo is resting inside.
253
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,000
Could you guys step away for a bit?
I want to talk to her alone.
254
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,030
Yes, ma’am.
255
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,640
Don’t be long.
256
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,610
I’ll be done in ten minutes.
257
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,770
Fine.
258
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,660
Nothing but creepy paintings.
259
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,640
Please, Sensei!
260
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,900
– What?! 					– What?!
261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,170
Whoa, my heart, my heart!
262
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,680
Huh? There’s nothing wrong.
263
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,840
Hey, it’s you again?!
264
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,320
To think you’d transform into Kurenai
with a Transformation Jutsu.
265
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,180
Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
266
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,660
Shut up! For your sake,
don’t be nosing around needlessly.
267
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,990
Hey.
268
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,660
You’re Yakumo. Right?
269
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,640
I want to ask you something
about Kurenai Sensei!
270
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,740
Damn it.
271
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,530
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
272
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,700
Will always be smiling right near by
273
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,640
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
274
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,210
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
275
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,120
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
276
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,960
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
277
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,900
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
278
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,270
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
279
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,640
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
280
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:15,110
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
281
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,980
The wind is probably testing our hearts
282
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,320
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
283
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,490
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
284
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,330
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
285
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,930
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
286
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,110
Will always be smiling right near by
287
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,650
Why am I sleeping in a place like this?
288
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,650
It’s because you trespassed
into the cottage
289
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,790
under special security, remember?!
290
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,650
Oh, right.
291
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,490
Geez, really…
292
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,660
Just be grateful you still have your life,
the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.
293
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,520
The Anbu Black Ops?
294
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,460
That’s right, I have no time for this!
295
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,690
Hey Naruto, where are you going?
296
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,900
Sorry Sakura, I have to ask
Kurenai Sensei about Yakumo!
297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,630
Oh, hey wait! Naruto!
298
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,940
Next time: “Yakumo's Sealed Power”
//%
1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,700
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,450
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,250
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,490
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,580
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,040
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,490
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,000
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,450
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,450
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,660
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,330
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,160
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,790
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,250
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,080
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,410
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,830
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,370
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,330
A Clash of Fate:
You Can't Bring Me Down!
21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,490
What incredible Chakra…
lt’s making my skin tingle.
22
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,870
My nose  too…
23
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,490
Mizuki…
24
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,490
What’s the matter?
Aren’t you coming?
25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,250
You jerk…!
26
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,750
Hey, Naruto!
27
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,790
Stop that!
28
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,330
You idiot.
29
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,410
Naruto!
30
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,750
Hey, hey.
31
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,750
Should you really be worrying
about others right now?
32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,830
He’s fast!
33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,000
And what’s more, such power…
34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,790
So this is the power Lord Orochimaru
was talking about…
35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,910
Amazing… It’s almost scary…
36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,120
Don’t you agree, Iruka?
37
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,540
Mizuki, please stop.
38
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,330
Please…!
39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,700
Tsubaki…
40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,870
I don’t care what happens
to me…
41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,490
I just don’t want you to
commit any more crimes.
42
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,790
Please!
43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,490
Return to the village.
44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,950
Tsubaki… If you care that much
about me,
45
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,910
then you could at least
be useful to me!
46
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,950
Tsubaki…!
47
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
What?!
48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,790
You’re so slow.
49
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,540
Iruka Sensei…!
50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,200
Damn!
51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,290
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
52
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,450
Hasty as always, huh…
53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,660
You sure haven’t made
any progress, have you?
54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,580
He vanished!
55
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,040
He didn’t vanish.
He’s just fast.
56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,410
That guy’s been accelerating since earlier
and moving into our blind spots…
57
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,490
In that case…
58
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,790
Everybody, better be very aware
of your surroundings!
59
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,250
I call it
Uzumaki Whirpool Formation!
60
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,160
– Right! 					– Right!
61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,370
I see…
62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,490
Even an idiot like him comes up
with an idea once in a while.
63
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,660
In that case…
64
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,330
I want to watch you experience
even deeper despair…
65
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,540
Despair that’s equal to that wisdom
you’ve managed to muster!
66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,790
There he is!
67
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,080
I see him!
68
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,080
It’s not that you saw me.
69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,200
I’m going out of my way
to show myself to you.
70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,870
There!
71
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,120
Damn… Even though I can see him,
I‘m unable to land any blows.
72
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,160
I’m telling you, I’m not foreseeing
your movements.
73
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,490
You’re just sluggish.
74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,410
Oww…
75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,580
Hey, serves you right.
76
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,830
You demon fox.
77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,290
Don’t be so delighted in such
a big way.
78
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,830
You’ll now get a taste of
the same agony I have endured.
79
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,660
Starting now, right, Naruto?
80
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,040
There’s still much more
to come!
81
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,120
Stop that, Mizuki!
Don’t lay your hands on Naruto!
82
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
Shut up, Iruka!
83
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,370
Do you have any idea how much
I’ve been waiting for this moment?
84
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,080
I’ve been waiting for this day
ever since then.
85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,540
For this time of revenge.
86
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,490
I will use this power of mine
87
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,000
and take my own good time
to crush each of you, one at a time.
88
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,490
Come on, stand up, Iruka.
I’ll start by killing this guy.
89
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,410
Mizuki…!
90
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,490
There you go. 					That’s good!
91
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,200
Come on!
92
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,410
You are pathetic.
93
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,080
There’s a world of difference
between us, isn’t there?
94
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,660
I’ve gotten my hands on
this extreme body
95
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,490
and it is your fate
to die wretchedly.
96
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,410
What do you mean,
"extreme body"?
97
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,080
When your power depends
on potions,
98
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,450
it’s not true power!
99
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,490
That sounds just like
the half-baked guy you are…
100
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,490
In that case, go ahead
and try winning…
101
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,490
Using that real power
you’re talking about!
102
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,120
I’m different from you.
You're gonna live out your life…
103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,490
as some lowly teacher who never thinks
about getting ahead in life,
104
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,490
who only gets used by the village
in whatever way they see fit.
105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,790
How do you like…this power…
and the way I carry myself?!
106
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,750
Even if you trained
a hundred years,
107
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,540
you'll never be able
to earn it!
108
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,490
I’m not gonna stop here!
109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,160
I’m still gonna get much
much stronger…
110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,580
I’ll get Orochimaru to share
his Hidden Jutsu with me.
111
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,080
Do you really think that will happen?
112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,370
I’m getting tired of you
playing the martyr.
113
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,120
I think it’s about time
to end this.
114
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,910
Isn’t this nostalgic…?
115
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,490
This time, I’ll get you for sure.
116
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,660
So prepare yourself.
117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Naruto!
118
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,660
You jerk! Don’t you dare lay
your hands on Iruka Sensei!
119
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,500
This is really something!
120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,500
Every little thing is exactly the same
as it was that other time.
121
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,490
But I’ve changed.
122
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,750
The reason for my defeat
that time…
123
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,250
was that I let my guard down
to the demon fox that you are.
124
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,450
Wh-What’s that?!
125
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,490
I won’t let my guard down again.
126
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,580
I’ll call upon all my strength
to beat you down!
127
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,910
Bring it on!
128
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,490
I’m sorry…both of you…
129
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,870
Choji!
130
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,000
Damn… If only I had a little more
information about those guys…
131
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,000
Elder Brother…
My body feels lighter.
132
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,200
Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter,
doesn’t it?
133
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,540
Okay, time for clobbering…
134
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,870
Yeah! Clobbering!
135
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,250
There they come.
136
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,580
Damn it!
137
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,040
Huh?
138
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,830
What the hell is this?!
139
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,080
M-My body…
140
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,250
Doesn’t move…!
141
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,490
Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis?
142
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,490
Looks like I made it in time.
143
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,000
Good work!
Shikamaru, Ino, Choji!
144
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,950
Leave the rest to me!
145
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,290
The F-Fifth Hokage!
146
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,330
No way…
Lady Hokage…in person?!
147
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,870
Lady Tsunade.
148
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,750
I’m sorry I found out
about this so late.
149
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,160
But I wouldn’t have imagined
150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,950
that these guys were
hanging out with Mizuki…
151
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,870
Fifth Hokage!
152
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,750
We are saved…!
153
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,830
Uh…uh…Elder Brother…
154
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,080
Oh…Oh…
155
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,120
Well, we run into each other
in unusual places, don’t we,
156
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Fujin and Raijin?
157
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,700
T-Tsunade…
158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,750
Let me ask what
you’re doing here.
159
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,490
Powerful.
160
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,790
More like, scary.
161
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,040
Now then, is there something
you want to say?
162
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,490
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
163
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,000
Please forgive me.
We’ll never do it again!
164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,490
So you guys went with Mizuki
because he told you that
165
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,040
you’d be able to eat something good
at Orochimaru’s place?
166
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,910
– I’m, I’m sorry.
– I’m, I’m sorry.
167
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,200
No way we could stand up to guys on the
same level as the Three Legendary Ninja.
168
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,580
But I wonder what happened
between them the past…
169
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,040
to make those two that scared.
170
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,620
No thanks. I don’t even want
to imagine what it might be.
171
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,490
Gimme a break.
Falling for such an obvious bait!
172
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,790
Mizuki has apparently gone
into those mountains up ahead.
173
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,490
Naruto and Iruka are probably
with him…
174
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,790
You guys come along
after recuperating a little.
175
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,330
Huh…wait a minute.
176
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,540
What are we going to do
with these two guys?
177
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,490
Huh? You don’t need
to worry about that…
178
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,540
More importantly, I can’t let them
cause any more trouble.
179
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,330
I’ve decided to make these guys
go home on their own.
180
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,950
Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assume
you understand this already,
181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,540
but if you’re even one minute late
you’re not getting any dinner.
182
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,490
– Yes, ma’am! 					– Yes, ma’am!
183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,080
We can’t be doing this, Raijin.
184
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Let’s hurry back to the institution.
185
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,250
Elder Brother, dinner, right?!
186
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,370
Dinner!
187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,330
– Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner…
– Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner…
188
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,330
Amazing…
what incredible speed.
189
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,790
It’s very important for
a person to eat, after all.
190
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,410
That’s just you.
191
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,040
Damn! His power is
even greater than earlier!
192
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,000
But I can’t let him
take me down.
193
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,330
This guy may have a lead
to Sasuke’s whereabouts.
194
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,660
Naruto!
195
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,910
Iruka, are you all right?
196
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,910
Yes...
197
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,870
Did you notice?
198
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,160
What?
199
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,490
Although that jerk’s power
has increased multifold,
200
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,500
the sharpness of his movements
is diminishing.
201
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,490
Huh?
202
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,000
Did he transfer the Chakra
he was using for speed, to power?
203
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,160
I don’t really know that, but…
204
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,000
That’s quite a heavy burden
for Naruto to bear alone.
205
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,580
But if that guy’s speed
has diminished,
206
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,490
there might be a chance to win.
207
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,490
All right… You hang in there
a little bit more, Naruto!
208
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,250
How about this,
you little brat?
209
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,660
Do you like the power of this body
that Lord Orochimaru gave me!
210
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,370
I’ll tear you apart.
211
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,080
Where the hell is he…?
212
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,450
That Orochimaru…
Where is he?
213
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,750
Why would I tell a little brat
like you that kind of thing?
214
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,700
He wasn’t in
the Village Hidden in the Sound.
215
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,290
The Village Hidden in the Sound?
Did you go there?!
216
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,490
The compound was
already totally empty…
217
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,200
Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaru
was there anymore.
218
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,830
You really gave that one
a lot of thought for a guy like you, huh…
219
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,830
I don’t know where you heard that
about the Village Hidden in the Sound…
220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,120
but if you’re trying to fluster me
by talking rubbish like that,
221
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,490
it’s not gonna happen.
222
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,790
Give up ‘cause you’re going
to the next world.
223
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,160
Listen carefully. Don’t you dare talk
that kind of trash again!
224
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,750
Naruto, this way.
225
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,620
Iruka Sensei…
226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,580
Just try to catch me!
227
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,580
You jerk…don’t even think
I’m gonna let you get away!
228
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,080
Now! Jump up, Naruto!
229
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,370
All right!!
230
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,330
Damn…this is…!
231
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,080
Seal and Capture Perimeter!
232
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,250
The Capture and Arrest Jutsu!
233
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,660
Rasengan!
234
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,370
Naruto, that Jutsu is…
235
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,160
So that’s the Fourth Hokage’s
Jutsu… Rasengan…
236
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,580
Are you all right, Iruka Sensei?
237
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,080
Naruto, that was spectacular.
Good work!
238
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,490
Listen Sensei…
239
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,490
It looks like this guy didn’t know
about the Village Hidden in the Sound.
240
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,490
So I was thinking that he’s no longer…
with Orochimaru…
241
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,700
Don’t talk trash…
242
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,490
Mizuki…
243
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,450
You gotta be kidding…
244
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,500
This is an extreme body that
I received from Lord Orochimaru…
245
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,830
I will go to the Village of Hidden Sound
and become even more…
246
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,870
Iruka Sensei What’s this?!
247
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,620
It’s just as I thought, after all.
248
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,580
Old Lady Tsunade…
249
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,290
Lady Tsunade.
250
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,790
His cells have started dying.
251
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,750
You jerk…
What have you done to me?!
252
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,910
It’s not Naruto’s fault.
253
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,490
It’s caused from the substances
you took!
254
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,120
What? That’s impossible!
255
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,490
You’re getting a taste of
your own medicine.
256
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,000
That substance wasn’t
fully developed yet.
257
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,370
The last casualty has been recovered.
258
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,490
It appears that Shizune was injured,
but there’s no threat to her life.
259
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,910
I see. Thanks for your work.
260
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,490
That’s a relief… Shizune is safe.
261
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,000
Orochimaru probably developed
that substance by chance
262
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,490
while he was trying to develop
a Forbidden Jutsu.
263
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
What is certain is that
264
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,250
that substance assimilates
the DNA of animals
265
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,950
and when it combines
with the human body
266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,490
that serves to draw out its power
in an explosive manner.
267
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,120
But its effect is only short term.
268
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,330
And in exchange,
it puts a strain on the cells
269
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,080
that far exceeds the limits
of the human body.
270
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,370
It certainly isn’t something
that’s one could actually use.
271
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,750
But why did Mizuki…?
272
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,080
I don’t know the details
273
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,330
but it must be that Mizuki
and Orochimaru
274
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,660
had a point of contact in the past…
275
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,330
However…
276
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,950
That tie has already been severed.
277
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes, unfortunately Orochimaru
just used him as a plaything.
278
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,490
Giving him an unusable drug…
he’s probably laughing his butt off.
279
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,830
But Mizuki is one lucky guy…
280
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,830
An ordinary Shinobi would
have lost his life.
281
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,080
Although he won’t be able to live
his life as a Shinobi any more.
282
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,790
Unfortunate, isn’t it, Naruto?
283
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,330
I kind of had that feeling anyway…
284
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,490
I see.
285
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,080
But I won’t give up!
286
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,410
I will continue to do my best to search
for clues to Sasuke’s whereabouts.
287
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,490
Tsubaki…
288
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,490
Damn it, Iruka!
289
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,790
Don’t talk!
290
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,490
Next time I’ll take you and that
little squirt down without fail.
291
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,250
There’s no way you
could do that.
292
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,540
While you were pursuing
your futile dream,
293
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,250
Naruto’s been actively honing
his skills.
294
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,160
You can’t possibly catch up
with him any longer.
295
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,250
Mizuki can never go back
to being a Shinobi again…
296
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,490
Tsubaki…
297
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,490
I’m thinking of starting over
again too…
298
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,620
But first I must atone for
all the trouble I caused the village…
299
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,620
What a beautiful sunset.
300
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,490
Let’s return to the village.
301
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,490
Dried and Canned Goods
302
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,450
Fish Market
303
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,700
I won't…
304
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,490
ever give up either!
305
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,660
I did it!
306
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,910
All right, since everybody
worked so hard today,
307
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,450
I’m going to do something special
and treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku.
308
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,000
Yippee! You’re a real man,
lruka Sensei!
309
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,490
I want a block of barbecued pork!
310
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,700
I want large portions of
all three kinds of ramen noodles –
311
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,490
miso, soy sauce and butter!
312
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,370
Hey, Iruka, before you do that,
313
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,910
you and Naruto need to go
to Leaf Village Hospital.
314
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,660
Huh…I told you I’m okay.
315
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,080
Don’t argue with me.
316
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,490
Lady Tsunade!
317
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,490
I cleared the first stage!
318
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,500
She’s just started her
ascetic training…
319
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,700
Could she be an exceptional talent
on par with Shizune…?
320
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,870
Hey, Sakura…!
321
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,790
This time you saved me…
322
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,250
You’ve really become stronger,
haven’t you, Naruto.
323
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,120
Crappy news pass us by
324
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,490
And you become speechless
325
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,490
My voice is way too soft
326
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,750
So you don’t answer
327
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,490
You’re crying   Crying alone
328
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,450
What can I do?   I’m crying too
329
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,830
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
330
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:07,160
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
331
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:16,660
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
332
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:25,870
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
333
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:37,620
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
334
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,790
I can't stand it any longer!
335
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,540
No matter how long I wait, there's no clue
about Sasuke's whereabouts!
336
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,660
And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keeps
telling me not to do a thing!
337
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,120
At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke!
338
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,370
Isn't there anything?
339
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,120
Something, anything...
a clue to finding Sasuke!
340
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,160

Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,060
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,650
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,230
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,350
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,940
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,650
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,440
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,310
Tsunade's Warning:
Ninja No More!
21
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,020
Good work, Akamaru!
You nailed it!
22
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,520
Midair Dynamic Marking!
23
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,650
Next, three twists!
24
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,940
Aim carefully!
25
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,810
Can one call that a walk?
No, I don’t think one can.
26
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,230
I can’t gather insects at ease.
27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,690
It’s so great…
28
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,480
that the three of you have things
you’re good at and that you love…
29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,150
I hope you’ll find
something like that too, Hinata.
30
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,440
You're right…
31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,940
And, what is it?
32
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,900
You had something
to tell me, didn’t you?
33
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,810
Umm…
34
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,890
Yeah…
35
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,890
So, using that as a hint,
36
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,560
think about the fastest way
to get to the destination.
37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,690
Start!
38
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,150
Everyone!
39
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,810
I’m sorry this happens all the time,
but class is over for today.
40
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,890
Yippee!
41
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,890
– Why? 					– Huh? Not again.
42
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,560
The handout is your homework!
43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,060
– What?! 					– Huh?!
44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,270
I’m so happy we didn’t have
the class for Taijutsu.
45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
But these days,
class either finishes in the morning
46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,230
or we have the whole day off…
47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,100
I wonder if that’s really okay.
48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,270
What’s up with acting like
a serious student?
49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,150
Right, Konohamaru?
50
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,770
Huh?
51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,890
Konohamaru?
52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,900
Konohamaru!
53
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,900
What do you think you’re doing
with Grandpa's things?!
54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,890
Honorable grandson…
55
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,230
Those belong to my Grandpa!
56
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,190
Where are you taking them?!
57
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,980
Uh…you mean these?
58
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,890
They are no longer used,
59
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,440
so I thought I’d put them into storage
in a different location.
60
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,100
No longer used, you say…
61
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,890
You think it’s okay to take Grandpa’s
things away without permission?!
62
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,310
The Fifth Hokage will be using
the chambers, you know.
63
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,190
The Fifth Hokage?
64
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,400
Y-Yes.
65
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,650
The next Hokage
has finally been decided.
66
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,190
The village can have peace of mind now.
67
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,480
That person apparently
doesn’t smoke tobacco…
68
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,230
What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!
69
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,100
It’s too soon for that!
70
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,350
When you depended on
the Old Man up to recently!
71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,980
What a lovely fragrance…
72
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,060
Huh?!
73
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,560
Wh-What are you doing?!
74
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,230
That’s exactly my question for you!
75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,980
You perverted kid…
76
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,650
I dare you to say that again!
77
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,400
Huh? You want me
to say it again?
78
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,600
Per-vert-ed kid!
79
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,890
Don’t call me that!
80
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,890
Lady Tsunade!
81
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,810
The elders are all waiting,
so we had better hurry.
82
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,890
Yes, I know.
83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,600
Be careful, little boy.
84
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,940
Please be more conscious
of your actions.
85
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,690
I’m the person
who has to deal with the complaints…
86
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,890
Okay, okay.
87
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,900
I’m not a little boy!
88
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,890
Who the heck are you?!
89
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,480
That’s my question…
90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,900
Naruto!
91
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,890
Konohamaru?
92
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,850
Long time no see!
93
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,480
Hey, more importantly, have you seen
a big-boobed, scary old lady…
94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,600
I mean, young lady?
95
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,890
I did see her!
96
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,730
– Where did she go?!
– Who the heck is she?!
97
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,890
Who is she?
98
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,940
She has to go
to the hospital straightaway!
99
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,730
Hospital?
100
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,230
That lady may not look it,
101
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,890
but she’s an awesome
Medical Corps Ninja!
102
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,310
She finally came back to the village
to become the Hokage, so…
103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,150
what is she taking her sweet time for?!
104
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,810
Hokage…
105
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,940
The Fifth Hokage.
106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,020
She better do what
she promised to do.
107
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,480
You’re lying…
108
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,230
Huh?
109
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,900
I don’t believe you!
110
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,890
It’s a lie!
111
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,890
What?
112
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,770
There are seven birds within 50 meters
behind me in the direction of the “2.”
113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,270
Tenten…?
114
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,060
Neji!
115
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,730
I just heard that that Lady Tsunade
has returned!
116
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,810
It’s the real McCoy.
Wanna go see her?
117
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
Sorry.
118
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,650
But I’m not interested.
119
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,190
Huh?
120
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,400
So there were…
121
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,270
eight birds, huh…
122
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,270
Listen carefully, Tsunade.
123
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,440
We must call the feudal lords
124
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,890
and announce the fact that
the Fifth Hokage has been chosen.
125
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,850
We will start preparations today
for the inauguration ceremony in the village.
126
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,770
Feudal lords and ceremonies
are just a big pain.
127
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,890
Tsunade!
128
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,890
Yes, yes, I know…
This is also the job of the Hokage.
129
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,900
– Genma! 					– Here!
130
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,520
– Aoba! 					– Here!
131
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,890
Issue an official notice and
132
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,890
convey this matter to those in the village
within the next few days.
133
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,900
We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.
134
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,770
– Yes, ma'am! 					– Yes, ma'am!
135
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,480
I hate you, Grandpa!
136
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,890
Why did you have to die?
137
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,850
The Fifth Hokage…
138
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,890
Gimme a break,
my shoulders are so stiff.
139
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,890
I wish I could just down
a nice cup of hot sake and relax.
140
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,890
Lady Tsunade!
141
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,350
Wait a second!
142
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,810
Before you do that,
143
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,100
you have something else you need to do,
Old Lady Tsunade!
144
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,560
What was it?
145
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,440
I told you, didn’t I?!
146
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,440
About Kakashi Sensei and
Sasuke and Bushy Brow!
147
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,890
Oh…right, right.
148
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,650
Hey, if it isn’t Naruto!
149
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,060
Huh? Shikamaru?
150
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,100
Why are you in a place like this?
151
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,520
That’s my question–
152
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,650
Why are you in a place like this?
153
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,850
I have no idea why,
154
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,730
but my father told me
to come along with him.
155
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,270
What’s up with that?
156
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,230
Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.
157
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,940
Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.
158
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,310
Are you taking proper care
of the deer?
159
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,600
The antlers of the deer from
that area make very good medicine.
160
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,350
Yes, I’m somehow managing.
161
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,650
Hey, Naruto, who’s that person
162
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,890
who acts like such
a big shot when she's so young?
163
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,020
That’s apparently the new Hokage.
164
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,890
Huh?!
165
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,890
Despite her appearance,
she’s an old lady in her fifties.
166
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,890
Yikes!
167
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,150
Well, see you again sometime.
168
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,310
Yes, ma’am.
169
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,350
All right, to the hospital!
170
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,890
See you later, Shikamaru.
171
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,060
I’m will show you an awesome
new technique I learned!
172
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,730
That’s the new Fifth Hokage…?
173
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,100
Hey, Shikamaru.
174
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,400
That person is the strongest
and most beautiful person in the world.
175
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,560
Huh?
176
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,400
I mean, she’s the lone female
amongst the Legendary Sannin.
177
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,890
Huh… A female Hokage?
178
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,980
I’m not very comfortable with women…
179
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
Huh?
180
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,850
Even though they're unusually frank,
they always hang around and
181
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,770
you're never quite sure
whose side they're on.
182
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,890
They always think they can make
men do whatever they want.
183
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,770
Anyway, they’re just a pain.
184
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,890
Hey Shikamaru…
185
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,350
Without women,
men wouldn’t be born.
186
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,600
If women weren’t around,
nothing good would come of men.
187
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,730
No matter how hard-edged
a woman might be,
188
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,600
she’ll show her gentle side
to the man she loves.
189
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,520
I can’t believe that Pa’s saying that…
190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,650
when he's tied to Mom’s apron strings.
191
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,230
You’ll understand once
you reach that age.
192
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,480
Oh no!
193
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,890
Let’s hurry up and
get our business done…
194
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,100
because Mom will chew us out
if we’re late.
195
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,350
Hurry up, Shikamaru!
196
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,690
Looks like nothing will come
of some men
197
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,900
even if they have a woman.
198
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,890
Konoha Hospital
199
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,350
I’m coming in.
200
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,770
Who are you…?
201
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,600
What a beautiful woman…
202
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,060
Sakura, Sakura!
203
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,770
Everything will be all right now!
204
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,650
I brought along an awesome person.
205
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,650
Sasuke will be fine now!
206
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Naruto…
207
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,150
Those two flowers aren’t from
the same day.
208
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,270
So this kid is coming here
every day, huh…
209
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,890
I heard from Guy Sensei…
210
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,690
Please save Sasuke.
211
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,770
OK, leave it to me.
212
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,060
Sasuke!
213
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,650
Sasuke…
214
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,190
Sasuke!
215
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,060
Sasuke, you…!
216
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,190
Hmm, despite his appearance,
that Naruto is pretty considerate.
217
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,600
Huh?
218
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,150
Next! Next!
219
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,100
How disgraceful!
220
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,730
To be taken down by
just two insurgents.
221
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,560
And here I thought you were a genius.
222
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,440
I’m sorry…
223
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,890
All right! Kakashi Sensei’s done!
224
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,560
Next, Bushy Brow!
225
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,350
Please hurry up and
take a look at my disciple Lee!
226
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,690
Lee!
227
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,650
I brought Lady Tsunade here!
228
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,690
That’s your disciple?
229
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,310
Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!
230
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,560
I see…
231
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,650
Naruto.
232
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,440
Huh?
233
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,520
Is it really okay for you
to be idling away your time here like this?
234
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,890
Uh, I almost forgot!
235
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,890
I had an appointment to
meet Iruka Sensei!
236
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,230
Go on!
237
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,900
OK! I’ll leave the rest in your hands!
238
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,890
All right!
239
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,190
Hey, Naruto!
240
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,150
You’re late, Iruka Sensei!
241
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,600
Sorry, sorry.
242
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,350
There were lots of things to do
with respect to the Fifth Hokage.
243
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,100
I guess…
244
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,850
Thanks for waiting!
245
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,890
I’m digging in!
246
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,810
Naruto.
247
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,560
Huh…?
248
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,400
You have really developed compared
to the time when you wanted this.
249
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,600
I have, haven’t I?
250
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,520
You think so too, right?
251
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,480
This headband that I received
from Iruka Sensei
252
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,940
suits me perfectly, don’t you think?
253
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,690
Stop being so cocky!
254
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,890
You still have a long,
long way to go!
255
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,020
You have lots of work to do!
256
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,020
Listen carefully, Naruto!
257
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,270
The Leaf Village is in
a very difficult situation right now.
258
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,900
Starting with the Third Hokage,
we lost many fine Shinobi.
259
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,900
The current strength of the Leaf
is less than half what it normally is.
260
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,890
Despite that, we must continue
to carry out our missions.
261
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,440
Why is that?
262
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,440
If you don’t have enough manpower,
you should turn it down.
263
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,020
No, that won’t do…
264
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,100
If we turn down our missions,
265
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,310
it would be like announcing
to other countries our weakened state.
266
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,850
Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailing
will probably be assigned to missions.
267
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,350
I see…these are difficult times.
268
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,850
Hey! This concerns you too!
269
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,890
You need to play an active role
and carry out your duties
270
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,100
in order to aid Lady Tsunade.
271
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,890
Yeah.
272
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,100
But, before I do that,
I need to satisfy my stomach.
273
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,890
That’s just like you.
274
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,190
Do your best!
275
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,900
Seconds!
276
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,890
Hey, hey!
How'd you finish so fast?!
277
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,560
I'll be straight with you.
278
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,060
Give up being a Shinobi.
279
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,480
L-Lady Tsunade…
don’t joke like that.
280
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,890
There are numerous bone fragments
in the area around important nerves.
281
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,440
Moreover, they are deeply embedded.
282
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,600
You’re not physically capable
of carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.
283
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,270
Come now, Lady Tsunade,
don’t joke like that…
284
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,520
Even if I were to operate…
285
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,190
Don’t be fooled, Lee!
286
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,650
That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!
287
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,520
You changed yourself
using the Transformation Jutsu,
288
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,690
you evil woman!
289
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,480
Who the heck are you?!
290
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Don’t I have any…chance?
291
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,810
There is no one besides me
who is capable of doing the surgery
292
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,440
and it would take too much time.
293
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,600
Furthermore, there is a huge risk…
294
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,310
Risk?
295
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,890
The probability of
a successful surgery is 50% at best,
296
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,890
and if it fails…
297
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,890
You’ll die.
298
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,650
Guy Sensei!
299
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,890
I’m not at all ready
to throw in the towel!
300
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,890
Guy Sensei, what’s this god-awful
bitter rice dumpling?
301
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,600
They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.
302
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,600
If you eat one hundred of them,
they should heal your wound.
303
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,400
I see, if I don’t eat
one hundred of them,
304
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,060
my wound won’t heal, right?
305
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,730
N-Not in a single day!
306
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,150
It’s better that you give up being
a Shinobi and look for a different path.
307
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,890
Lee…
308
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,520
Lee…
309
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,150
If I knew this was going to happen,
I shouldn’t have brought you to him.
310
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,650
Don’t say that…!
311
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,850
I am painfully aware of how you feel,
but it’s better to be clear.
312
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,060
Because it’s something he’ll have
to understand sooner or later.
313
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,400
The longer we wait…
314
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,890
the harder it will be for him.
315
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,400
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
316
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,890
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
317
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,890
On your still shoulder
318
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,690
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
319
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,190
The city lights are like pieces of stars
320
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,940
That hold us together
321
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:58,810
“Each one of us glows differently,”
322
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,480
you say laughingly
323
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,350
but you look most dazzling
324
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,270
Like a comet,
325
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:18,480
like the rainbow after the storm
326
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,690
You bring light into my heart
327
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:35,900
Being lost can be the answer
328
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:44,890
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
329
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,890
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
330
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,020
Konohamaru, just come out
from there already!
331
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,890
Shut up!
332
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,270
Listen, I'll treat you to
a bowl of ramen!
333
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't want any!
334
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,480
OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.
335
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,890
You're such a pest!
336
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,520
What did you just say?!
337
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,440
In that case,
I'll pull you out by force!
338
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,890
Be ready for that!
339
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,980
Next time:
"The Will of Fire Still Burns!"
340
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,850
Don't miss it!
//%
1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:09,690
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:17,940
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,230
One more time
4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,940
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,480
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,190
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,890
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,480
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,730
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,890
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,940
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,890
One more time
15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,890
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!
16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,150
There’s nothing to worry about…
17
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,100
What?
18
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,520
Sasuke and I…
19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,890
We didn’t just get here late
for no reason.
20
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,690
Late for the Show, But Ready to Go!
The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!
21
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,270
The third eye…
22
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,770
There is no doubt… That Jutsu is…!
23
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,730
Darn…Gaara…
24
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,890
Tora, Saru, Ne, Tatsu, Tori,
lnu, Ne…
25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,980
Mi, Inu, Uma, Ushi, Tora, U, Tori…
26
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,520
Tatsu, Mi, Inu, Ne, Tora, Ushi, Saru…
27
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,310
Tatsu, Mi, Hitsuji, Saru…
28
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,900
Tori, Saru, I, Hitsuji, Uma…
29
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,730
Tatsu, Tora…
30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,730
Tora, Saru, Ushi, Hitsuji, Ne, Uma…
31
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,810
Tora, Ushi, Ne, Tora, Tatsu…
32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,890
Tori, Tatsu, Mi…
33
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,890
Hitsuji, Saru, Tori…
34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,810
Tatsu, Tora, Hitsuji, Saru, Tori…
35
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,520
As I thought, it’s no good.
36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,980
I, Hitsuji, Uma, Tatsu, Tatsu,
Tatsu, Ushi, Ne…
37
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,890
Inu, I, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji, Uma…
38
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,890
Withdrawing like that…
39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,600
I don’t know what you’re up to…
40
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,060
but the timing is perfect.
41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,890
This thing of mine also takes time!
42
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,900
Hey, is something the matter?
43
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,850
No…
44
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,810
It must be my imagination…
45
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,770
Hurry up!
46
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,890
Sensei…
47
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,850
Hm?
48
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,890
What did you mean when you said
that you didn’t get here late for nothing?
49
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,440
Hmm…
50
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,150
You want to know why?
51
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,520
Like I said, this isn’t the time
to be talking about that!
52
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,560
Shut up and watch him.
53
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,940
‘Cause you’ll get a real surprise.
54
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,980
That idiot…
55
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,730
Gaara…we never know when
the signal is going to come!
56
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,060
Yeah…
I’m gonna tear him open.
57
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,890
That’s how it comes out.
What?
58
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,150
The contents…
59
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,400
Lots and lots are coming out, right?
60
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,020
I’ll give it all to you.
61
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,730
I’m always a good boy!
62
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,480
Yeah, let’s do it.
63
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,890
Mother, I’m watching so…
64
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,730
Darn! He’s totally useless,
no matter what we do now.
65
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,230
He’s not even
abiding by the plan.
66
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,020
He looks like he’s just going
to screw things up!
67
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,810
That Gaara!
68
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,150
Hey, hey, wouldn’t it
be better if we flee…?
69
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,850
Plan…?
70
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,520
How’s it going?
71
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,890
All preparations are proceeding
in accordance with the timeline.
72
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,600
Please hurry up with preparation
for Summoning.
73
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,980
I want to be sure we’re able to
make our move at any time.
74
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,190
Understood!
75
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,400
All right, I’ll leave that to you.
76
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,060
D-Don’t tell me that…
77
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,350
The reason I decided to
train Sasuke was…
78
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,940
because he was like me.
79
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,900
A physical Activation?!
80
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,770
I see…
81
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,060
That’s why he went through
the physical training
82
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,890
and increased his speed significantly…!
83
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,890
That’s right!
84
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,560
Awesome…
85
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,940
The Chakra is clearly visible
to the naked eye…
86
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,150
What in the world is happening?!
87
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,520
Don’t tell me that
he learned that Jutsu…!
88
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,890
So this is the Uchiha Clan…
89
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,850
Exactly…
90
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,890
W-What the heck is that?!
91
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,480
What a sound!
What’s that technique?
92
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,400
That’s just a jab…
93
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,770
Huh?!
94
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,150
However, it is the one used by
Leaf Village’s number one technician.
95
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,900
That’s the only original technique
of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi…
96
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,650
It’s the special technique used
only for assassinations…
97
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,770
Its secret is in the speed of the jab,
98
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,770
and also the physical aptitude
that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,
99
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,150
the ability of the Chakra to
focus solely on the target,
100
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,400
and moreover the speed of
the jab makes a “chichichichichi” sound…
101
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,900
A unique sound attack similar
to the rumbling of a thousand birds.
102
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,150
And that’s why that technique is called…
103
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,890
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
104
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,890
No way!
That Gaara’s absolute protection is…
105
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,890
It’s impossible…
106
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,520
Don’t tell me…
107
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,940
Excellent work…
108
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,890
That’s…
109
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Kakashi’s…
110
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,150
Chidori…
Also known as Lightning Blade.
111
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,850
Lightning Blade?
112
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,100
Lightning Blade is another name
for the Jutsu derived
113
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,730
from Kakashi’s ability to cut through
lightning using that technique.
114
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,560
Huh? Cut through lightning?
115
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,730
Huh? That sounds fishy…
116
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,690
A-Awesome…
117
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,890
The real name of that technique
is Chidori…
118
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,060
The secret is the speed of his jab
that surpasses any human limitations
119
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,890
and the intensity of
the Chakra on his arm…
120
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,520
And that arm turns virtually
into the equivalent of the swing
121
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,890
of a celebrated sword that
cuts through everything.
122
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,560
But what a reckless technique…
123
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,730
That’s not for you to say…
124
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,730
Right, Lee?
125
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,690
It’s beyond my scope of
comprehension, but…
126
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,890
What an awesome technique!
127
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,400
I can understand it…
128
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,480
If it were me, if I made
a running start at that speed,
129
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,600
I wouldn’t make a direct jab attack
on the opponent…
130
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,350
Or rather, I couldn’t.
131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,940
For an opponent,
132
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,890
a straight line attack just gives him
an easy chance to launch a counterblow.
133
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,690
And moreover, I don’t have the eyes
to read that counterblow.
134
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,400
I envy you…Sasuke!
135
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,890
When I fought you once, I said…
136
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,310
Even if one understands visually,
137
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,850
it’s meaningless unless
one can move physically…
138
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,350
I was filled with
a feeling of superiority.
139
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,350
But now, you have a body that moves
at the same high speed as mine.
140
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,690
Moreover, you have…
141
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,890
the Sharingan!
142
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,600
I caught you!
143
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,310
Third Squadron.
We are ready any time.
144
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,980
All preparations are complete
on this end too.
145
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,810
Roger. Proceed with action
at the signal.
146
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,690
Looks like it’s almost time.
147
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,770
The guy who was worrying about
Sasuke until just a moment ago…
148
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,350
is now jealous of him.
149
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,440
Sasuke…
150
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,890
This is the feeling!
151
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,940
Summoning Jutsu!
152
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,890
I’ve gotten stronger…
153
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,810
In order to become Hokage…
154
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,560
In order not to lose to anyone…
155
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,060
Sasuke!
156
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,400
In order not to lose to you.
157
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,350
I want…to fight you, too.
158
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,890
But you are…
159
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,480
Yeah…
160
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,730
What…? This warm thing…?
161
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,270
Mother…? What is…?
162
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,560
Blood…my blood is…!
163
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,890
D-Don’t tell me that…
164
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,100
D-Don’t tell me that
Gaara is hurt?!
165
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,730
What is it?!
166
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,940
It’s that thing’s arm!
167
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,690
Darn! Doing something
careless like that…
168
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,770
Has the Perfect Possession happened?
169
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,270
I don’t know.
He seems to be injured…
170
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,890
This has never happened before.
171
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,150
It gives me the chills
just to remember…
172
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,770
When I first saw that thing,
I wasn’t able to eat…
173
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,230
I mean, visually it’s totally…
174
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,890
What is…
175
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,150
this sensation?
176
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,850
He’s hurt, after all…
177
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,890
The shell was broken when
his body was incomplete!
178
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,890
It’s different! Those aren’t the eyes!
179
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,560
W-What was that…
that look earlier on?!
180
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,350
Huh…?
181
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,940
What’s this…? I can’t see…
182
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,060
Kakashi! This must be!
183
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,900
Yeah…a Genjutsu!
184
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,730
– Release! 					– Release!
185
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,480
What’s going on…?
186
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,770
Release!
187
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,650
Genjutsu!
ls Kabuto already moving?
188
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,190
In that case, it’s just about time…
189
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,310
It’s coming!
190
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,480
Shall we begin?!
191
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,890
It’s the signal!
192
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,560
– Start the operation!
– Start the operation!
193
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:29,060
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
194
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:40,400
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
195
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,060
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
196
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,190
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
197
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,520
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
198
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,770
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
199
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:21,890
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
200
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:32,730
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
201
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:43,270
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
202
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,890
Forge on strong
203
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,440
It got dark all of a sudden…
it feels so good.
204
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,600
I hear something in the distance.
205
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,810
Sakura’s voice, Kakashi Sensei’s voice…
206
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,440
Scream? I just heard something loud.
207
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,150
I think I do, but… 					Sasuke…
208
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,770
I got to watch his match!
209
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,480
But I really don’t know
what’s going on.
210
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,100
Next time: “Zero Hour!
The Destruction of
the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!”
211
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,270
What in the world is going on?!
//%
1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:09,720
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,970
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,260
One more time
4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,970
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,510
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,220
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,890
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:54,760
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:17,970
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,930
You shouldn’t lower your guard, Sensei.
16
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,930
I’ll bury you and correct
old mistakes, now!
17
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,840
Whatever you do now, it’s too late…
I’ve won…
18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,220
The Leaf Village will crumble!
19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,350
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will
of the First and Second Hokages…
20
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,840
The Third Hokage!
21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,220
Orochimaru! Now I will perform an
ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!
22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,220
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!
23
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,050
Forbidden Secret Technique:
Reaper Death Seal!
24
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,260
A Jutsu I don’t know…
25
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,050
Must hurry…
This darkness is dangerous.
26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,510
I’ll have you show it to me.
27
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,600
What’s the matter?
28
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,890
Are you planning to be killed
slowly by your predecessors?
29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,970
Please perform that Jutsu, quick.
30
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,430
Not yet…?
31
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,890
It looks like…I was just in time.
32
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,390
What’s the matter?
You’re already stumbling…
33
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,840
Now all that’s left…
is to catch them!
34
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
I got you!
35
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,840
I won’t let go!
36
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,840
Appear!
37
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,840
The darkness has disappeared…
What’s this Jutsu?
38
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,510
Sarutobi!
39
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,840
I’m sorry…Sarutobi…
40
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,600
We caused you trouble…
41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,220
Please forgive me…
42
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Lord First Hokage!
43
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,840
Lord Second Hokage!
44
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,140
Seal!
45
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,840
Your own subordinates…!
46
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,840
All members in
the Leaf Village are a part of me.
47
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,300
The villagers believe in me,
and I believe in everyone.
48
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,470
That’s what the Hokage is.
49
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,100
Saru… Protect those who love
the village and believe in you.
50
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,390
And bring them up as individuals
to whom you can leave the next era.
51
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,760
As of tomorrow, you are the…
52
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,930
Hokage!
53
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,930
Toying with even the lives
of your own subordinates…!
54
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,430
Subordinates’ lives?
Stop the endless nonsense!
55
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,800
Didn’t these kids believed in you?
56
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Come! Enma!
57
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,100
You’re mine!
58
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,300
Striking Shadow Snake!
59
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,550
Dang it! You little--!
60
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,140
It’s over!
61
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
What is this sensation…?
62
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,840
This is bad…
63
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,180
– Die! 					– Die!
64
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,840
We have to hold them off here somehow.
65
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,010
Isn't our back-up here yet?!
66
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,850
This is out of our hands!
67
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,760
Ninja Art: Summoning!
Bring Down the House Jutsu!
68
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,350
This Jutsu…
69
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,220
Long time no see, Ibiki.
70
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,930
Jeez, is that body
the only thing that grew?!
71
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,890
I can’t stand to look!
72
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,850
Master Jiraiya…
73
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,850
Jiraiya…! One of Sannin,
the three legendary Shinobi?!
74
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,840
Peeps, open up those little eyes
of yours just this once and observe well.
75
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,430
How wonderful!
76
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,600
The devil region beyond heaven
of Jiraiya, the fantastic sage Ninja…
77
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,260
will rage!
78
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Snakes that have been antagonized
by the frog. Begone!
79
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,350
So that Orochimaru has finally started, eh?
80
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,390
Where’s the Third Hokage?
81
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,680
The Exam arena.
82
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,640
I see…
83
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
Don’t die…old man.
84
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,640
Why…didn’t you dodge?
85
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,760
Dang it!
86
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,010
The Reaper Death Seal…
87
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,720
In this Sealing Jutsu,
88
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,970
in exchange for the effectiveness
of Jutsu…
89
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,180
one’s own soul is handed over
to the Grim Reaper.
90
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,550
It’s a Jutsu that costs your life…
91
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,640
My Jutsu doesn’t activate…
92
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,840
There’s no need to dodge.
I will die, anyway.
93
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,800
At the same time the Sealing ends,
my soul will also be devoured.
94
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,760
It’s a Jutsu of the hero
who once saved this village.
95
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,010
From now, you will also die…
by this Jutsu!
96
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,840
So this Jutsu also sealed
that Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!
97
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,680
And now, your soul will be dragged out…
and sealed!
98
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,220
My body…won’t listen to what I say!
99
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,390
You’ll probably be able to see it soon.
100
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,720
Your soul is also already
about halfway out, so.
101
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,430
Those who have their souls sealed
by this Jutsu
102
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,720
will suffer inside the belly
of the Grim Reaper for eternity
103
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,890
and will never attain peace…
104
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,840
Those who seal and are sealed
have their souls intertwined,
105
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,890
and will hate each other,
and continue to battle for eternity!
106
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,390
What…?!
107
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,600
This is… the Grim Reaper?!
108
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,300
Knock it off! You old dotard!
I won’t let you do as you like.
109
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,220
Hurry up and…die!
110
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay, everyone. Line up!
111
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,260
Quiet, everyone!
112
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,220
Konohamaru!
113
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,140
Konohamaru, it’s not going
to collapse, is it?
114
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,470
It’ll…it’ll be okay.
115
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,300
The structure of this face rock path is old,
but is of strong construction.
116
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,140
My grandpa said so before.
117
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,760
So it’ll definitely be okay.
118
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,260
Someone’s coming!
119
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,510
Which one…?
120
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,050
Uchiha, huh?
121
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,100
Then, what about Temari?
122
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,640
Don’t run away like that…
123
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,840
Fine.
124
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,350
I’ll be your opponent this time.
125
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Wait!
126
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,840
Temari!
127
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,890
I assumed you’d been
creamed by him.
128
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
So you’re okay?!
129
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,840
Yeah. Somehow…
130
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,840
But…
131
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,010
it didn’t turn out to
be much of a delay.
132
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,010
No, it’s time necessary for
Gaara’s recovery.
133
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,050
Besides, it’ll lead to
his consumption of Chakra.
134
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,850
This is…
135
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,840
Shampoo, again?
136
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,640
No, it’s Sasuke.
137
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,840
There are several smells near him.
He caught up…
138
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,390
At last…
139
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,680
Sasuke.
140
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,890
He’s totally stopped moving.
141
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,350
Is he going to fight with them?!
142
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,760
Sasuke…
143
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,350
Let’s hurry!
144
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,260
What’s this clump of countless smells
coming from another direction?
145
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,300
Hey! There’s something besides us
tracking Sasuke!
146
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,350
What?!
147
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,840
An enemy? An ally?!
148
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,840
I don’t know. But…
149
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,010
But?
150
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,760
It’s not human.
151
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,760
Huh?!
152
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,890
Huh?!
153
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,760
Go! Kankuro! I’ll take him again…
154
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,800
Temari, you take Gaara
and go on ahead.
155
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,600
What?
156
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,140
You’re at your limit…
157
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,720
I don’t need a hindrance.
158
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
But…!
159
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,840
Go!
160
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,140
Hurry up and go!
161
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,600
Okay…
162
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,350
It can’t be helped…
I’ll be your opponent!
163
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,260
Humph! I don’t care who it is!
164
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,510
No!
165
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Your opponent is me!
166
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,260
You…!
167
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,220
Shino?
168
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,640
Why are you here?!
169
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,850
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena.
170
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,840
The females have almost no smell…
171
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,180
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.
172
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,840
Though the male itself
has a strong smell…
173
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,260
Sasuke Uchiha…
You pursue Gaara.
174
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,640
Because the battle between you
and him hasn’t been settled yet.
175
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:58,050
I’ll fight him, because originally
I was his opponent…
176
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,890
I withdraw!
Please go ahead with the match.
177
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,970
Leave this to me here! Go!
178
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,850
You’re very confident.
But are you going to be okay?
179
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,220
No need to worry.
180
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,970
I’ll go back you up if
I have just ten minutes.
181
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,850
Humph. By then, I’ll be done too.
182
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,840
None of you know anything at all.
183
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,930
You guys probably don’t know
of the real terror of this world.
184
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,140
In that case…
you’ll teach me that terror?
185
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,840
No…
186
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,800
If you defeat me and chase Gaara,
you’ll be forced to know.
187
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,050
That is, only if you can defeat me.
188
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:28,050
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
189
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:39,390
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
190
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:55,050
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
191
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,100
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
192
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,510
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
193
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,760
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
194
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
195
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:31,720
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
196
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:42,260
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
197
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,840
Forge on strong
198
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,930
You who are strong…
You who are called Uchiha…
199
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,180
You who have friends…
You who have a purpose…
200
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,800
You who are like me…
201
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,550
By killing you, I can truly exist!
202
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:22,890
Uchiha, you are my prey!
203
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,990
Next time: “Astonishing Truth!
Gaara’s Identity Emerges!”
//%
1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,180
One more time
4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,840
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:45,430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,680
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,840
Sasuke’s movements have stopped!
There’s still quite a bit of distance, though…
16
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,430
So Sasuke caught up to him, huh?
17
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,220
Okay!
18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,840
Huh? This smell is…?!
19
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,470
W-What’s wrong?!
20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,720
Did something happen to Sasuke?!
21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I didn't notice until now.
22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,260
You…
23
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,640
use the same shampoo as me.
24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,930
This floral green fragrance…
No doubt!
25
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,970
H-Hey now…!
26
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,840
Well…my coat’s shinier.
27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,470
Don’t be saying stupid things
at such an important time!
28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,840
– I'm the same as a dog?
– Sorry, sorry…
29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,430
Same as a dog… Same as a dog…
30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
– Hey Sakura?
– Same as a dog…
31
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,220
Same as a dog…
32
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,180
Same as a dog… Same as a dog…
33
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,760
Hey Sakura…! 					Wait!
34
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,840
Oh! Hey! Don’t go ahead of me!
35
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,550
A Mistake from the Past:
A Face Revealed!
36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,430
Dang it!
37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Sasuke Uchiha!
38
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
I won’t let you get away now!
39
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,970
Jeez, this kid of all people…
at a time when Gaara is like this.
40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,300
Man, this is bad.
41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,470
Heh! That’s fine.
42
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,390
Kankuro! Take Gaara and go quickly!
43
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,850
Leave him to me!
44
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,680
But Temari…!
45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,600
No matter how you look at it,
you can't beat him alone!
46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,760
Leave me be!
47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,970
This is an important mission for
the Village Hidden in the Sand!
48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,600
Make Gaara the first priority!
49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,350
Besides, he’s quite my type of a guy…
50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,970
Go! Kankuro!
51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,930
I don’t think so!
52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
I won’t let you get away!
53
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,220
Eat this!
54
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,800
My opponent is that Uchiha kid…
55
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,840
This is not good. I only have
a bit of Chakra left.
56
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,840
I’ll stand even less of a chance
if he uses his Sharingan here…
57
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,100
But I need to get him to use
a large amount of Chakra at any cost.
58
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,800
Shall I take care of her in
one hit with Chidori? Or…
59
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,720
In this situation, maybe I should…
60
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,470
As I thought… He’s trying to save
some Chakra for Gaara.
61
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,840
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
62
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
Don’t underestimate me!
63
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,010
Ninja Art: Sand Storm!
64
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,510
Darn! I have to do something about
that bothersome fan…
65
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,010
Humph… I wonder how long
you’ll last with such a way of fighting.
66
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,600
It can’t be helped…
67
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,220
It looks like you’ve finally
gotten serious, eh?
68
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,390
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
69
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,930
That’s the stuff!
70
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,510
Aim with precision!
71
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,220
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
72
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,800
Did I get her?
73
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,430
Wind Scythe Jutsu!
74
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
I’ve got you.
75
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,100
Oh no!
76
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,220
Now!
77
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,600
You’re mine!
78
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,600
Good!
79
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,100
W-What?! Substitution?!
80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,760
Oh no!
81
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,180
Sorry, but I don’t have the time
to be dealing with you forever!
82
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,720
D-Dang it…
G-Gaara, at any cost…
83
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,840
What's that?!
84
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,050
What the heck is going on?
85
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,350
Who the heck is that youth?
86
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,550
Who on earth are you?!
87
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,050
Is it so sudden you can’t tell?
88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,470
It’s me. Orochimaru.
89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,430
It can’t be… Have you completed
that Forbidden Jutsu?
90
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,100
I struggled for decades…
after leaving the village.
91
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,840
You’re a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!
92
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,840
So, he did it, huh…?
93
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,970
The reason I couldn’t select you
to be the Fourth Hokage…
94
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,100
is because of that distorted
consciousness.
95
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,680
I’ve finally been found out, eh…?
96
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,050
It’s too bad.
97
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,680
Orochimaru…
What’s the meaning of this?!
98
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,840
Here I’d set that
many booby traps…
99
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,010
so I was quite surprised.
100
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
But I see… So it was you.
101
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,840
Recently, there has been a steady stream
of people going missing from the village,
102
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,970
from Genin to Chunin,
and even Anbu Black Ops members.
103
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,840
There was also information that
you had been acting strange…
104
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Master Orochimaru…
105
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,390
Why did a Shinobi of your rank
do such a thing?
106
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,260
Shall I kill you, too?
107
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,970
Orochimaru! Sure enough,
this was your doing…?
108
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,680
Say it! What were you doing here?!
109
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Alas! I’ve been found out.
110
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,600
There’s no point in acting cute…
111
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,140
It’s for Jutsu development!
112
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,470
Orochi… You!
113
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,430
For that purpose, you did this
to fellow Shinobi…?!
114
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,510
As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh…
115
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,350
What is it that you want?
116
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,720
I want everything!
117
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,260
Everything, you say?!
118
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,970
Get every Jutsu and understand
all of the truths of this world!
119
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
The one who first mixed
blue and yellow
120
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,840
named the new color made
in that way, green.
121
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,760
I just want to do the same thing.
122
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,970
If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign…
123
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,140
and green is a Jutsu.
124
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,140
In the same way that there
are no limits to the kinds of colors,
125
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,840
there are probably also tens
of thousands of Jutsu in this world…
126
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,300
But in order to get any
and all of the Jutsu…
127
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,840
as well as the truths,
a long time is necessary.
128
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,720
It’s the one who takes those
long years to know everything,
129
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,890
who can suitably be called
the ultimate individual.
130
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,840
For me, the life span of
the body is too short.
131
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,640
Too fleeting.
132
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,840
Even if I were to be called the Hokage,
if I die, it all ends there.
133
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,010
Orochimaru… Could it be that
the Jutsu you’re testing here is…
134
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,050
Right… It sure could be…
135
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,840
Immortality Jutsu!
136
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,510
Immortality Jutsu is a technique of
137
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,840
eternally pooling one’s own
spirits into this earth…
138
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,430
In other words,
it’s a Revival Jutsu where…
139
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,680
you find a new body, put your own spirit
into that body and take it over.
140
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,430
I assumed my old form until now,
141
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,470
so that you would feel nostalgic
about our reunion…
142
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,140
Aging is an empty thing, isn’t it?
143
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,300
I feel that keenly when I look at you.
144
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
You’ll die here…
145
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,640
and I’ll get a younger,
more beautiful and stronger body…
146
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,470
The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun…
147
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,300
I get it…
You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!
148
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,220
Right… Exactly… Sasuke.
149
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,180
A Reviving Jutsu where
someone else’s body is stolen
150
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,800
and the spirit is immortalized, huh?
151
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,010
How many faces and bodies
have you gone through?!
152
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,890
Two, I think…
153
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,800
I plan to take Sasuke over after
raising him a little more to my liking.
154
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,550
But after all, in order to make you regret
your very own life…
155
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,840
and curse destiny as you die…
156
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,100
…perhaps this face is better?
157
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,970
You monster!
158
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,800
Lord Hokage!
159
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,850
Don’t lower your guard, Sensei!
You’re always too soft…
160
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,140
What’s been wrong with you?
This isn’t like you!
161
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,720
I’m sorry…
162
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,640
Eyes…
163
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,300
Eyes with malice and ambition
concealed in them…
164
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,930
I had noticed that
you had such tendencies.
165
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,260
I had noticed,
but pretended not to know.
166
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,180
It was still during the war-torn era.
167
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,010
A genius who brimmed
over strongly with ability…
168
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,180
Nothing less than a phenomenon
that comes once in several decades.
169
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,470
So I wanted to think that
170
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,800
you would carry on
my own will and power.
171
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,970
That softness on my part…
172
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,550
created the conditions of that time
as well as now!
173
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,840
Are you going to…kill me?
174
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,760
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!
175
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,970
I wonder if you can…
Sarutobi Sensei!
176
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,840
Kill him, Sarutobi!
Now’s your only chance!
177
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,220
Sarutobi… You…
178
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,800
I couldn’t kill him…
179
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,640
I’ll bury you and correct
my old mistakes, now!
180
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,010
Here I go!
181
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,260
It’s too late!
182
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,680
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
183
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,430
No way!
Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
184
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,260
To disperse the little Chakra
he has left…!
185
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,140
You’ve gotten old, after all…
186
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,390
To think you’d shorten your
own life span out of impatience…
187
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,840
D-Don’t tell me, you…?!
188
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,930
Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, Mi…
189
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,840
This order of Signs…
190
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,760
I knew it, Sarutobi,
you are using that Jutsu!
191
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,640
So this is the Grim Reaper
the Fourth Hokage was talking about,
192
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,930
which only the one who has signed
a contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!
193
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,970
Whatever you do now, it’s too late…
I’ve won.
194
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,430
The Leaf Village will crumble!
195
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,720
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is the home where I live.
196
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,840
The Hokage exists as the pillar
to protect that home!
197
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,100
The Hokage is the one who inherits
and is entrusted the will of the Leaf.
198
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,390
I won’t go easily!
199
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,720
Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!
200
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,260
Stupid nonsense…
201
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,470
You’re merely a temporal head
202
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,850
in the history of the organization
called the Leaf Village…
203
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,390
Even the face rock that is left
will eventually weather and decay.
204
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,390
Humph… Leaf Village is
not just an organization to me!
205
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,430
In the Leaf Village,
206
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,930
every year many Shinobi
are born and raised…
207
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,260
and live and fight…
and die to protect the village.
208
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,140
The people of this village…
209
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,840
even if they don’t have blood ties…
210
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,010
To me, they are precious…
211
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
precious…
212
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,640
family!
213
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:32,720
Then I shall smash you, the pillar,
and destroy the Leaf home.
214
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:39,390
Humph! Even if you kill me,
that pillar will not break!
215
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,840
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will
of the First and Second Hokages…
216
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,050
The Third Hokage!
217
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,100
No matter how much you target
this Village Hidden in the Leaves…
218
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,850
A new Hokage will carry on my will,
shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!
219
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,430
Right, Fourth Hokage?
220
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,050
Orochimaru! Now I will perform
an ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!
221
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,840
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!
Reaper Death Seal!
222
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:27,970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
223
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:39,300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
224
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
225
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
226
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
227
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
228
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
229
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:31,640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
230
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:42,180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
231
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,840
Forge on strong
232
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,840
Every year in this village,
233
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Shinobi are born, nurtured,
and fight for the sake of the village.
234
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,430
They live to protect the village and
things that are precious to them.
235
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,890
Even if they aren’t related to me,
they are my precious family.
236
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,050
I won’t let you have your way
with my family!
237
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,300
Next time: “Forbidden Secret Technique:
Reaper Death Seal!”
//%
1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:09,870
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,120
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,410
One more time
4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,120
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,660
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,370
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,040
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:45,660
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:54,910
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:02,990
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,990
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,120
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,990
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,990
One more time
15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,580
The rules are the same as
in the preliminaries.
16
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,040
The match goes on until one of you
dies or admits defeat.
17
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,790
When it’s determined that
there’s a winner,
18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,830
the match can be stopped.
19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,120
But that’s my decision.
20
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,330
Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Hey Guy! You too, Lee…
22
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,000
Is your body all right?
23
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,950
Kakashi!
24
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,290
Kakashi Sensei!
25
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,040
Oh! Sorry, sorry.
26
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,000
You must’ve been worried.
Sorry for not contacting you at all…
27
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,750
Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad…
28
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,160
I don’t really mind that.
29
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,500
It's hard to see from here…
30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,580
Sasuke…
31
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,870
Kakashi Sensei…
32
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,540
Hm?
33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,660
You know about the mark
on Sasuke’s neck, don’t you?
34
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,700
Is that…?
35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,500
No need to worry.
36
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,160
A mark?
37
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,990
So, that’s that.
38
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,250
Yup!
39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,990
One…
40
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,790
Two…
41
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,160
Three…
42
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,620
Four…
43
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,700
Five…
44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,950
Six…
45
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,580
Seven…
46
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,040
Eight.
47
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,790
Eight of them…
48
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,200
There are eight members of
Anbu Black Ops in this spacious arena…
49
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,370
Two platoons are too few…
50
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,620
What’s Lord Hokage thinking?
51
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,000
Well…without knowing how or when
the opponent would make their move…
52
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,750
It can’t be helped that the Anbu
are dispersed and deployed
53
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,830
in important areas in the village.
54
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,040
Huh?
55
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,410
It’s about to begin.
56
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,410
We shouldn’t let our guard down,
but for now…
57
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,990
We need to pay attention…
to this match.
58
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,830
Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking out
what sort of training you gave him…
59
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,910
as your eternal rival!
60
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,700
Huh? Did you say something?
61
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,330
No! You’re slick, Kakashi!
62
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,370
Why are you always so avant-garde?!
63
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,200
Both of you, to the middle!
64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,870
Begin!
65
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,990
So this is the sand
Kakashi told me about…
66
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,160
Please don’t get so mad…
67
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,990
Mother…
68
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,830
What’s he talking about…?
69
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,990
Earlier… Earlier I had you suck
awful-tasting blood.
70
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,660
I’m sorry.
71
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,120
But this time it’ll likely…
72
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,450
taste good.
73
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,040
His conversation’s started.
This is dangerous.
74
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,660
This is the first time I’ve seen Gaara
get like that before fighting.
75
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,990
So it must mean his opponent
is that imposing…
76
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,290
Him.
77
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,410
It appears he’s calmed down.
78
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,790
Come on.
79
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,990
Hey…
80
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,080
Do you remember…
what he said yesterday?
81
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,990
At that time…
82
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,990
I will kill…you all without fail.
83
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,500
Just wait.
84
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,750
That’s what he said…
85
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,450
But he didn’t do it.
86
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,700
It was the perfect opportunity, but…
87
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,700
he didn’t even see us.
88
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,500
Now, let me feel it!
89
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,370
We're…
90
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,250
unsatisfactory for him.
91
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,990
Right now, the only one who
can make him feel anything…
92
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,330
…is only Sasuke!
93
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,540
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself…
94
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,160
And if I see that all other people
in this world
95
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
exist only to make me realize that,
96
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,250
there could be no world more wonderful.
97
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,990
Naruto…
98
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,990
Here we go!
99
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,580
The Sand Shield became
a Sand Clone!
100
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,990
He’s fast! This guy…
is just like that guy…
101
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,410
He’s fast! It’s nearly the same
as Lee’s ordinary speed.
102
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,700
And…
103
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,330
It's overlapping with the image…
104
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,990
of my Taijutsu!
105
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,200
Is that the Sand Armor?
106
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,200
Come on!
107
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,910
Thank you, Anbu man.
108
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,040
So apparently, Hinata will be
all right for now if she rests.
109
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,410
Oh, is that right?
110
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,290
Huh? You know this person?
What‘re you taking about?
111
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,080
This person is an Anbu…
112
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,790
Not that, but at the examination…?
What do you mean?
113
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,750
Well, this is what it means…
114
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,990
Come on!
115
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,580
If you’re not gonna come at me,
I’ll go at you!
116
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,620
He’s fast!
117
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,990
What’s the matter? Is that it?
118
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,870
A-Amazing…
119
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,080
That armor…I’ll tear it off.
120
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,540
His speed is basically the same
as Lee’s with the weights removed.
121
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,080
It’s… It’s exactly like
Lee’s Taijutsu.
122
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,830
His speed is also completely
different from before!
123
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,910
Sasuke… You are indeed
a genius beyond imagination.
124
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,450
How many years did it take me
to attain that speed…?
125
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,990
And you attained it in a mere month…!
126
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,830
However, it seems to consume
a lot of stamina
127
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,990
to continue that movement.
128
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,450
What’s Gaara planning to do?
129
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,580
The sand armor uses up too
much Chakra…
130
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,370
It can’t last for very long.
131
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,330
What the heck sort of training
did you do?!
132
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,290
Hm?
133
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,830
To get to that level in a mere month…
134
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,790
Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsu
with Sharingan.
135
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,410
So during the Taijutsu training…
136
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,580
I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements.
137
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,620
Sasuke could make
that movement his own
138
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,750
only because he knew Lee.
139
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,700
Of course, Sasuke had to
work very hard for it.
140
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,750
But…with only that…
141
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,950
With only Taijutsu…
that Sand guy can’t be taken down!
142
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,990
That Kakashi…
143
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,990
He must have seen the battle
144
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,990
between the hateful Gaara
and the lovable Lee.
145
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,750
Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
146
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,950
can’t work against an opponent
that even Lee couldn’t take down.
147
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,990
He should have known this only to well.
148
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,540
So if that’s the case…
149
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,040
Why is it that he had Sasuke
master only Taijutsu?!
150
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,370
Why did I keep living?
151
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,160
But as long as you’re alive,
you need a reason…
152
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,250
If you don’t have one,
it’s just the same as being dead.
153
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,290
What's this guy saying?!
154
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,000
So this is the answer I came to…
155
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,750
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.
156
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,750
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,
157
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,790
finally, I became calm.
158
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,540
Oh?
159
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,200
Shikamaru…
160
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,990
We need to go over to where
Kakashi Sensei is right now!
161
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,370
What’re you planning to do?
162
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,660
Hey!
163
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,990
I'm going to…
164
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,990
stop this match!
165
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,660
Gaara couldn’t possibly be planning
to use that Jutsu!
166
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,990
So he used all the sand for protection…
167
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,870
I didn’t think there could be this
much of a difference in the hardness
168
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,950
with a difference in the density
of the sand.
169
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,080
So it’s absolute protection.
170
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,870
The sand…
lt’s covered his entire body.
171
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,990
This is somewhat troublesome.
172
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,990
Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
173
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,870
Kakashi Sensei!
174
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,620
Naruto!
175
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,750
Huh? What do you want?
176
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,660
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!
177
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,410
That guy is totally different from us!
178
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,990
He’s not normal!
179
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,330
Naruto… 					What’re you saying?
180
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,790
He lives to kill people.
181
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,990
In any case…
182
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,250
If this continues, Sasuke will die!
183
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,990
Jin, Saru,
184
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,990
Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru…
185
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,950
There’s no mistake about it.
lt’s that Jutsu!
186
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,620
This isn’t good!
Our plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind.
187
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,660
Shoot!
188
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,040
Kakashi Sensei!
189
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:29,120
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
190
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:40,450
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
191
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,120
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
192
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,250
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
193
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,580
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
194
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,830
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
195
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:21,990
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
196
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:32,790
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
197
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:43,330
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
198
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,990
Forge on strong
199
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,870
Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
200
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,410
Even if one understands visually,
201
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,290
it's meaninless unless one
can move physically.
202
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,200
I was filled with
a sense of superiority.
203
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,910
But now, you have a body that moves
at the same high speed as mine.
204
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,660
Moreover, you have…Sharingan!
205
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,750
Next time,
“Late for the Show, But Ready to Go!
The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!”
206
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,200
I am really envious of you, Sasuke!

Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,190
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:44,480
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,850
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,150
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

20
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,890
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja
21
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,520
even though I can't
use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
22
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,890
That would be the ultimate for me!
23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,150
All right!
24
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,150
I’m going to do my best again today!
25
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,810
Oh! Bushy Brow!
26
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,480
Oh… Good morning, Naruto.
27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,310
Hey, hey, did you already get checked out
by Old Lady Tsunade?
28
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,400
How was it, how was it?
29
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,980
The Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now,
30
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,690
so we must do our best!
31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,020
You’re right.
32
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,400
Bushy Brow, you should get better
as soon as possible
33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,650
and succeed in your mis--!
34
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,350
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!
35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,400
What’s the matter?
36
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,440
It’s Konohamaru!
37
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,730
Huh? What’s wrong with Konohamaru?
38
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,890
He’s in trouble.
39
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,400
In trouble?!
40
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:23,230
The Will of Fire Still Burns
41
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,650
At this rate,
we will have to open it by force.
42
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,980
Try it! Who do you think I am?!
43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
I am the grandson of
the Third Hokage!
44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,650
If you go against me, then…
45
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,440
It means you’re going
against the Hokage!
46
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,650
We need Lady Tsunade
to assume her position immediately.
47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,770
Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!
48
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,020
You'll get something even more terrible
if you come close to me.
49
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,100
Honorable grandson! Even for you…
50
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,890
There are things that can
and cannot be forgiven!
51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,890
Shut up!
52
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,230
What is all this commotion
so early in the morning?
53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
It’s hurting my head.
54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Lady Tsunade…
55
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,980
It's just one kid…
What're you doing?
56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,980
Yes…
57
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,350
Get rid of him!
58
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,890
But it’s the grandson
of the Third Hokage!
59
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,650
It doesn’t matter if
he’s the grandson or the great grandson.
60
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,890
I am the granddaughter
of the First Hokage!
61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,810
He might just open his eyes
if he gets roughed up a little.
62
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,980
Now move it!
63
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,940
– Yes! 					– Yes!
64
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,850
Wait!
65
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,890
Naruto?!
66
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,890
Hey, hold on there.
67
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,770
I don’t really know
what's going on,
68
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,890
but don’t be so rough with Konohamaru,
Old Lady Tsunade.
69
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,270
An acquaintance of yours?
70
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Yes, yes…
71
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,190
I’ll do the convincing,
leave it to me.
72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,690
Then, do something
by the end of the day!
73
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh, Lady Tsunade… Please wait!
74
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,730
Excuse me.
75
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,730
Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has already
been discharged from the hospital.
76
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,730
I’m actually here to see Lee today.
ls he in the rehabilitation room?
77
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,770
Not yet.
That’s not like him to be late.
78
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,900
I see.
79
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,150
The probability of a successful surgery
is 50%, at best.
80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,310
And if it fails, you'll die!
81
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,770
Hey, Konohamaru.
What are you doing in there?!
82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,190
Hurry up and come out.
Then let’s go eat some ramen.
83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,890
Don’t worry. It’s on me!
84
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,890
You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!
85
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,150
All right! You can have eggs too!
How about that!
86
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
At least answer me!
87
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,810
Shut up, you fool!
88
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,980
You called me a fool!
89
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,480
Open up already! I’ll break in! Hey!
90
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,730
Try if you can!
91
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,650
W-Why you--!
92
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,810
– Naruto… 					– Naruto!
93
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,940
Oh, Lee… You’re here.
94
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,400
S-Sakura!
95
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,480
I wanted to bring you this.
96
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,980
F-For… me?
97
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,890
Th-Thank you very much!
98
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,650
I-I’m sorry, Sakura.
99
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,810
No worries.
100
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,850
Sasuke is now recuperating at home.
101
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,560
Thanks to Lady Tsunade.
102
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,890
At this rate,
103
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,900
seems like he’ll be able
to get back to his duties very soon.
104
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,150
I see. That’s very good.
105
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,190
Lady Tsunade is great, after all.
106
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,060
I think if you had her take a look,
you’d get better very quickly.
107
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,890
Yes…
108
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,600
But if there is something
that I can do,
109
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,020
please feel free to tell me.
110
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,850
Thank you very much, Sakura.
111
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,810
Then I’ll see you soon.
112
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,900
I would think that at least
one bar would be open.
113
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,440
There’s no way.
What time do you think it is right now?
114
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,480
I can’t drink sake, and I can’t gamble.
115
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,600
This place, the Hidden Leaf Village,
is no fun at all.
116
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,020
Just like the Third Hokage.
117
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,270
Lady Tsunade!
118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,890
Oh, I’m tired.
119
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,270
I just want to sit down and
have a drink somewhere.
120
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,190
I understand.
121
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,560
I will take you to a place where
you can sit and have a drink.
122
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,730
What?
123
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,890
But I will have you do your work!
124
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,060
Here now, go ahead. It’s hot.
125
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,890
Shizune…you’ve suddenly
become very strict!
126
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,900
I haven’t gotten strict.
lt’s probably that you were not aware.
127
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,770
Not aware?!
128
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,810
“If I can’t get in the room,
then I don’t have to work.”
129
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,850
Isn’t that what you were thinking?
130
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,900
And that’s why
you left it up to Naruto.
131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,480
Humph! Could be…
132
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,980
This is the most recent list
of Ninja.
133
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,060
The names and lineups of
the groups have changed a lot.
134
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,600
So please look through them.
And I mean, look through all of it!
135
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,480
Oh bother.
136
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,690
They have sweet rice cakes, too.
137
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,440
I don’t like sweet things!
138
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,810
Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!
139
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,810
At least tell me why you’re doing this!
140
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,900
Konohamaru!
141
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,810
Darn!
142
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,850
Everybody came here because
they’re worried about you!
143
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,690
If you don’t come out,
I’m going to drag you out of there!
144
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,310
Naruto Sacred Technique...
145
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,890
Sexy Jutsu!
146
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,650
Konohamaru, come out!
147
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,190
Konohamaru, hurry!
148
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,900
Hey! Say something at least!
This is so embarrassing!
149
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,850
Don’t fool around with me!
150
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,850
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
151
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,980
– Stop it already, Konohamaru!
– Stop it already, Konohamaru!
152
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,810
One, two…
153
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,520
– Uh, what is this?
– What the--?!
154
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,020
What's going on?!
155
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,020
Are you okay? Naruto?
156
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,650
This is the Old Man’s room.
157
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,060
Eight D-rank missions,
three C-rank missions…
158
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,350
I see, very much like the Kurenai team.
159
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,900
We can easily figure out
what the Third Hokage was thinking.
160
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,810
This is the same as
their parents’ team.
161
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,400
I see.
162
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,890
Oh, I see. This team has their own specialty
and is well-balanced.
163
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,520
My shoulders are stiff.
164
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,520
I’m going to go get
some fresh air outside.
165
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,520
Success…
166
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,980
Success…
167
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,940
Naruto…
168
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,520
Uh… Darn!
169
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,900
If that’s how you’re going to be,
then I’m not going to go easy on you.
170
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,890
This is the Old Man’s room!
171
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,900
I won’t let anybody
use this room besides him!
172
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,890
The Old Man’s…?
173
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,900
That’s why, as his grandson,
I’m going to protect it!
174
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,600
Fool! This isn’t the time for that!
175
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,940
The Leaf Village is in great danger!
176
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,100
So what?! It doesn’t matter to me.
177
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,890
Are you seriously saying that?!
178
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,850
Oh, now I’m mad!
179
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:08,440
And I can easily tear down one
or two doors with my new powers--!
180
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,890
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!
181
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,560
Old Lady Tsunade…
182
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,730
Oh! Watch out!
183
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,600
W-Wow…
184
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,230
Listen Konohamaru.
185
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,850
The Hidden Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now!
186
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,060
Our forces have dropped to almost half,
and we have to finish our missions!
187
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,890
That’s what I taught you!
188
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,890
Yeah… um… well…
189
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,690
But if we don’t accomplish
our missions,
190
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,890
that’s letting other countries know
that the village has been weakened.
191
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,890
That’s what Iruka Sensei taught you!
192
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,100
Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?
193
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,690
It’s not that!
lt’s not that at all.
194
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,690
Then what is it?
195
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,940
Soon, nobody will call me
honorable grandson.
196
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,850
Then I’ll just become
plain old Konohamaru.
197
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,350
So what’s wrong with
plain old Konohamaru?
198
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,150
No…
199
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,770
Why, why?! You hated
being called honorable grandson!
200
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,020
Everybody’s going to forget
about the Old Man.
201
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
The Old Man.
202
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,690
They’re going to forget what
a great Ninja he was,
203
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,980
they’re just going to put him away
like an old ashtray.
204
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,650
The new Hokage will make all kinds
of changes in the Leaf Village.
205
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,890
That’s not true!
206
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,730
The Hidden Leaf Village is
the Hidden Leaf Village.
207
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,230
And besides,
nobody will forget about the Old Man!
208
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,100
No! They will never forget about him!
209
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,230
They will forget, I guarantee it.
210
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,890
They won’t forget!
211
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,850
That’s a lie!
212
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,190
It’s not a lie!
You can’t believe what I am saying?!
213
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,560
That’s right, I can't!
214
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,850
Oh boy!
215
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,850
Come with me, Konohamaru!
216
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,810
We just have to get Old Lady Tsunade
to promise
217
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,310
that she won’t change
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
218
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,480
And then on top of that,
219
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,730
we can get everybody to promise us
that they won’t forget about the Old Man!
220
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,600
What?
221
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,890
Isn’t that what you want?
222
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,190
I can’t believe that I let
Lady Tsunade out of my sight!
223
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,890
Did you find her, Tonton?
224
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,810
Revitalizing the cells, I see.
225
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,190
I’ve found you Lady Tsunade.
226
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,100
What?
227
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,890
Lady Tsunade is studying?!
228
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,690
Be quiet! I can’t concentrate.
229
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,730
Concentrate?!
230
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,770
I’ve never heard you use that word
except when you're gambling.
231
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,890
Is that Shizune’s voice?
232
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,890
Shizune…
233
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,890
Do you remember that Medical Ninja
by the name of Kabuto?
234
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,890
What about him?
235
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,810
His ability to create new cells.
236
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,100
I was researching ways to use
that power on the patients.
237
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,900
For Lee?
238
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,890
If the 50% chance becomes 51%,
it’s worth a try.
239
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,150
It really depends on the individual’s traits.
240
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,190
Even for you,
it might be hard to acquire those powers.
241
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,520
I’ll just have to try.
242
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,890
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
243
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,890
It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.
244
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,900
I am the Third Hokage, after all.
245
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,770
If you don’t like it,
you should just quit!
246
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,060
Everybody from the village
is my family.
247
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,270
To protect the family,
that is the duty of a Hokage.
248
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,650
Oh! Old Man!
249
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,900
Just for today,
I’m making a special exception.
250
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,350
What’s the matter Konohamaru?
251
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,890
Don’t you want to see
Old Lady Tsunade?
252
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,900
No.
253
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,890
I’ll just have to do it.
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
254
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,890
It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.
I am the Third Hokage, after all.
255
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,480
It can’t be helped.
I am the honorable grandson, after all.
256
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,810
Huh?
257
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,890
I am Konohamaru of
the Hidden Leaf Village, after all!
258
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,440
H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!
259
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,810
What’s going on with him?
Hey Konohamaru!
260
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,060
Lady Tsunade?
261
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,270
Nothing…
262
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,150
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
263
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,650
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
264
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,810
On your still shoulder
265
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,440
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
266
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,940
The city lights are like pieces of stars
267
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,890
That hold us together
268
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:58,560
“Each one of us glows differently,”
269
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,230
you say laughingly
270
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,100
but you look most dazzling
271
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,020
Like a comet,
272
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,230
like the rainbow after the storm
273
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:25,440
You bring light into my heart
274
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,890
Being lost can be the answer
275
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:44,730
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
276
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,810
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
277
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,600
Back then, Sensei taught me
278
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,480
that I would grow up to become
a great Ninja
279
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,690
through lots of effort and
competition with my rivals.
280
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,810
His words put me at ease.
281
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,400
A path opened up for me
just when I was unsure of myself.
282
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,730
I realized that all I had to do
was try my best.
283
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,150
But now…
284
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,770
Next time: "Sensei and Student:
The Bond of the Shinobi"
//%
1
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,020
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,770
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,560
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,890
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,900
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,350
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,810
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,310
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,770
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,770
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,980
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,650
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,480
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,100
All the kids said
15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,560
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,400
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,730
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,150
into this windless night
19
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,690
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,310
Orochimaru's Shadow
21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,310
No way… What happened
to Iruka Sensei?
22
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,310
Iruka’s scent ends right here…
23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,850
In any case,
all we can do is search for him.
24
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,520
Damn it. Where’s Iruka Sensei?!
25
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,440
Iruka Sensei!
26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,400
What a relief!
27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
You’re safe!
28
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,150
Somehow…
29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,900
Damn…that Mizuki…
30
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,150
Iruka Sensei…
31
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,770
That injury…
32
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,890
Huh, this injury is nothing…
33
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,890
Iruka Sensei!
34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,890
I’m all right…
I just had a little rush of pain…
35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,400
Somebody’s approaching!
36
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,730
What a relief
the wound’s not deep.
37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,060
Yes…
38
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,350
The atmosphere feels kind of heavy…
39
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,690
Hmm…There must be something
between those two…
40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,270
Well, what I think is…
41
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,900
What’s up with the paw pad?
42
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,770
Idiot! Look carefully!
The little finger, the little finger!
43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,890
Little finger? Huh?!
lruka Sensei’s?
44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,310
Well, my intuition tells me
that it’s positive…
45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,810
Naruto, what are you two
talking about?
46
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,520
Uh, nothing!
47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,150
Huh? Let me make an introduction.
48
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,270
This is Tsubaki…
Mizuki’s fiancée.
49
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,150
Fiancée? Mizuki’s…?
50
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,810
Ah, it’s negative…
51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,150
What’s up with that reaction?!
52
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,890
Mizuki has caused problems
for you again…
53
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,890
I sincerely apologize for that.
54
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,940
So you know about
Mizuki’s prison break…?
55
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,400
Yes…
56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,150
He came by my house once…
57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,940
I became aware of that immediately
and tried to stop him.
58
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,230
But ultimately the result
was that I allowed him to go…
59
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,520
It really couldn’t be helped
in light of the situation…
60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,900
No. I should have tried
even harder to stop him.
61
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,520
But I…
62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,940
Iruka, Naruto, I beg you!
63
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,310
Please take me with you!
64
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,060
Tsubaki…
65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,440
I understand that I’m making
an impossible request!
66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,770
But I want to stop him,
no matter what!
67
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,060
Iruka Sensei!
68
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,890
Tsubaki, I understand how you feel.
69
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,600
In that case…
70
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,560
I’m sorry, but I cannot allow that.
71
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,230
But why…?
72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,890
Why can’t she?!
73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,650
Naruto, we must hurry up
and search for Mizuki!
74
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,560
If she’s with us,
she’ll interfere with our mission!
75
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,890
But… But…!
76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,890
Iruka… If that’s the case,
I think I'll be of service to you.
77
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,770
I have an idea of
where he might be heading!
78
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,770
Is that true, Tsubaki?!
79
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,480
There’s probably no mistake…
80
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,890
But…
81
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,350
I beg you!
82
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,400
I think it’s certain
83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,310
that he’ll use various tricks to camouflage
his tracks as he flees…
84
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,690
If we spend time on that…
it will all be too late!
85
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,350
Please take me with you!
86
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23…
87
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,850
Huh, what was the result?
88
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,850
The Ninja Herb: Creeping Saxifrage…
89
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,690
Huh?! Who are you!
90
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,230
Dragon, Rooster, Dog…
91
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,890
The lookouts have been taken down!
92
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,310
It’s an intruder!
93
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,310
What?!
94
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,900
The Nara Clan’s research lab
was attacked?!
95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,100
Yes… I just received a dispatch
from the Nara Clan…
96
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,190
According to the dispatch,
97
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,150
the insurgent’s physical characteristics
match those of Mizuki.
98
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,520
Mizuki’s…?
99
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,890
Yes!
100
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,520
What is that Naruto doing?
101
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,890
But it’s something to have come up
with the idea of the Nara Clan’s institute…
102
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,980
Notwithstanding the abundance of
narcotic substances that are stored there,
103
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,890
due to its remote mountain location,
security is comparatively lax.
104
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,350
And what substances were stolen?
105
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,400
Well… Because of their thorough control
of the substances,
106
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,560
they were able to determine immediately
which substances were taken…
107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,890
So the description matched
after all, huh…
108
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,230
But even if a mere Chunin were
to remove those narcotic substances
109
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,560
what would he be able
to do with them?
110
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,650
Oh… Thank you. You may go now…
111
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,440
Yes ma’am!
112
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,890
In any case,
I can’t take any chances…
113
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,730
There’s nothing I can do if
I don’t know what his objective is.
114
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,060
If I can’t discern that from
the actual materials…
115
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,190
there may still be some means…
116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,270
Perhaps the proportions
of the formula,
117
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,480
or possibly the order
in which they’re blended…
118
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,520
There’s no mistake that
it’s this direction, right?
119
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,730
Yes… Please continue to
proceed just like this.
120
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,150
Tsubaki, you said
“It will all be too late.”
121
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,560
But do you know what
his objective is?
122
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,400
Probably… Although maybe not totally.
123
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,730
Tsubaki, please tell us!
124
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,850
In the past, he told me…
125
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,890
"I will get my hands on Orochimaru’s power
and go to where Orochimaru is."
126
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,400
What was that?!
127
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,060
The reason he stole
the Scroll of Sealing
128
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,520
was simply because
he had chosen it as a hospitality gift…
129
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,600
Tsubaki… You knew that?
130
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,100
I didn’t convey it to the village…
131
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,270
Just removing the Scroll of Sealing
is a serious felony…
132
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,730
And moreover, I was scared for
what’d happen
133
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,900
if his real objective
had come to light…
134
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,890
I believed that he would
mend his ways.
135
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,650
In that case you cannot avoid
retribution either.
136
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,560
I am prepared for it.
137
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,100
I thought it was strange…
138
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,690
If you knew where Mizuki was going,
139
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,230
you should have pursued him alone
in the first place.
140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,730
But you…
141
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,060
I may not be able to stop him alone…
142
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,270
I want to stop him at any cost…
143
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,890
I don’t want him to commit
any more crimes.
144
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,940
Unbelievable!
145
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,520
That Orochimaru…
So this was his plan!
146
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,060
However, could an ordinary Ninja
really manage to do this…?
147
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,650
It’s something only within
148
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,440
the realm of an experienced
artisan’s technique…
149
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,270
I’m busy!
150
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,020
I have a progress report on
the inmate prison break incident!
151
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,350
All right… Enter!
152
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,350
Yes, ma’am!
153
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,150
We have just finished
recapturing all inmates
154
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,890
with the exception of three –
Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin.
155
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,900
Good work…
156
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,890
We are now continuing to investigate
the other three…
157
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,980
But, the last inmate we captured said
something that concerned me…
158
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,020
Something that concerned you?
159
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,730
Yes… He apparently saw the three of
them fleeing together…
160
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,810
Fujin and Raijin were fleeing
with Mizuki?!
161
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,770
Damn it!
162
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,890
Lady Tsunade…?
163
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,480
I’m going out!
164
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,560
Where are you going?
165
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,850
There’s no need for you to come…
166
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,890
If what he said is true,
167
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,890
the guys I sent out won’t be able
to deal with the situation alone…
168
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
Hey, Shikamaru…
lf things continue like this…
169
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,650
we’ll be in trouble!
170
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,150
We’re already in trouble…
171
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,770
Shikamaru… All the Chakra is…
172
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,310
I know that…
173
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,890
I’ve thought of several methods,
174
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,270
but if I let go of these guys we are
gonna find ourselves in trouble…
175
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,650
You insolent jerk!
176
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,890
Having said that,
177
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,770
I can’t take them down simply
by catching them,
178
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,150
so that’s why I’m doing this…
179
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,480
I won’t let you leave here alive!
180
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,100
These guys have monstrous stamina…
181
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,730
And what’s more,
182
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,890
although their bodies
look like rubber at first glance,
183
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,890
with that much muscle strength
their instantaneous reflexes
184
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,480
are probably quite something too…
185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,650
In other words,
186
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,310
you’re saying that this is
the only possible method…
187
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,850
Let’s do our best, everyone!
188
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,190
Sorry about this…
189
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,150
What do you think, Mizuki?
190
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,890
It’s no good…
lt’s unfortunate but, he can no longer…
191
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,190
I see…
All right! Let’s withdraw!
192
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,230
Hurry up!
193
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,480
Yeah…
194
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,890
It’s unfortunate but…
195
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,190
guys who are of no use
on the battleground
196
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,020
only become a ball and chain…
197
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,400
Even though it’s just a minor injury,
198
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,480
you won’t be able to move
from this place, can you?
199
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,230
Who’s that?!
200
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,890
Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?!
201
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,150
I saw that…
202
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,560
No way… This can’t be, you’re…
203
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,100
Orochimaru?!
204
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,650
You are correct…
205
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,890
This can’t be…
Why are you here?
206
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,890
Your whereabouts are supposed
to be unknown!
207
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,980
It doesn’t matter why…
208
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,690
More importantly,
209
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,690
I witnessed something
very interesting earlier on…
210
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,730
You took the life of
an injured comrade, didn’t you?
211
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,060
You saw that…?
212
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,020
That piqued my interest…
213
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,650
That’s not a sight one sees
very often among the Leaf Shinobi
214
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,270
who devote their entire time
to playing house in the village…
215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
So what are you trying to say?!
216
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,890
I didn’t do anything wrong!
I had no choice but to do what I did!
217
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,850
You’re a short-tempered child,
aren’t you…?
218
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,440
I’m not reproaching you.
You were just carrying out your mission.
219
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,900
That’s right…
220
00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:00,770
But… Is there anybody in
the Leaf Village who acknowledges you?
221
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,900
What did you just do?!
222
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,890
What in the world is this…?
223
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,440
This is my present to you…
224
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,890
Go visit that place if you feel like it.
225
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,890
Here it is…
226
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,900
Looks like there hasn’t been
a trespasser here before me…
227
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,270
The eighth one on the right…
228
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,850
What’s happening?
229
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,230
What is that power of
Orochimaru’s anyway?
230
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,150
I don’t know either.
231
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,190
And I don’t know when
he encountered Orochimaru either…
232
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,270
But I’m positive that the answer to
those questions is waiting just up ahead!
233
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,770
That Scroll of Sealing incident…
234
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,600
You must be angry about it,
aren’t you, Naruto?
235
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,020
I don’t care about that in
the least anymore…
236
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,310
Because I repaid my debt to that
jerk Mizuki right there and then.
237
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,730
But…
238
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,890
But?
239
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,020
If that guy is still connected
to Orochimaru,
240
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,600
I need to ask him about something!
241
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,890
Because there’s someone
I need to find at any cost!
242
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,890
Sasuke…!
243
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,020
It’s up there…
244
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,100
All right!
245
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,020
That’s everything…
246
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,270
With this all…
247
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,520
This will …
248
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,900
This will make me perfect!
249
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,850
This place is…
250
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,520
That guy has done something…
251
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,770
That smell gives me the shivers…
252
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,230
Smell?
253
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,190
I was wondering who that was…
254
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,890
You guys are really persistent,
aren’t you?
255
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,890
Well, this is very convenient.
256
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,350
Because I was intending to take
you guys down anyway.
257
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Mizuki…
258
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,100
You jerk!
259
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,350
Mizuki… Your ambitions end here!
260
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,900
Impudent as always, huh…
However, you’re too late!
261
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,690
Just like you always are…
262
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,310
What is that?
263
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,020
Beautiful, don’t you think?
264
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,230
Damn it!
265
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,890
You guys…should feel honored
to be my first prey…
266
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,900
What?!
267
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,940
That’s…almost like…
268
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,850
But that’s they way it is,
isn’t it, Naruto…?
269
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,890
It’s true, you were actually special.
270
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,890
But…
271
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,890
Then that’s…
272
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,190
Orochimaru’s power!
273
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,400
Mizuki…
274
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,890
Crappy news pass us by
275
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,400
And you become speechless
276
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,400
My voice is way too soft
277
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,690
So you don’t answer
278
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,310
You’re crying   Crying alone
279
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,150
What can I do?   I’m crying too
280
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,770
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
281
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:07,890
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
282
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:17,600
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
283
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:26,810
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
284
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:38,560
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
285
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,560
That’s what you meant by
the “invincible body”?
286
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,730
No matter how much strength
you gain,
287
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,480
the kind of strength dependant
on drugs can never be a true strength!
288
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,900
Hah! Just like Iruka Sensei says!
Orochimaru’s Drug?
289
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,810
I’ll crush that kind of nonsense,
so be prepared!
290
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,020

You Can’t Bring Me Down!”

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,230
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,730
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,520
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,850
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,100
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,390
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,770
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,390
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,730
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,730
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,270
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,600
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,440
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,270
All the kids said
15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,520
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,390
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,690
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,350
into this windless night
19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,650
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,850
A Battle of Bugs!
The Deceivers and the Deceived!
21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,310
What the heck is happening…?
22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,810
Why does Hinata have
to be kidnapped?!
23
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,390
Why are there guys who know
that we’re searching for Bikochu?!
24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,650
We were being watched all this time.
Ever since we arrived…
25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,730
You were aware of that?!
26
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,980
You’re the only one who didn’t know.
27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,600
Why didn’t you tell me?!
28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,850
Because if we told you,
you’d have raised a big fuss!
29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,440
And the insects would flee!
All the insects…!
30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,190
Including the Bikochu!
31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,020
If they tried to steal the Bikochu
from us through force,
32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,270
the insects would be in danger
of getting hurt.
33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,390
So they captured Hinata and
decided to go with a hostage exchange.
34
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,900
That’s very smart of them.
35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,900
Something smells sweet…
36
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,440
It’s the smell of honey.
37
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,940
Bee’s honey…
38
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,310
Bees…?
39
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,230
Hinata’s scent ends here…
40
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,730
In that case…
41
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,150
Those guys waited for a moment when
Hinata was alone
42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,400
and attacked her using bees.
43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,560
I’ve heard that in the Hidden Stone Village
in the Land of Earth,
44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,390
there’s a clan of insect handlers
who primarily use bees.
45
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,900
The name of that clan is…
the Kamizuru Clan.
46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,150
Kamizuru…? That’s a name
that isn’t heard very often.
47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,940
Seems they were once hailed as being
at a level equal to the Aburame Clan…
48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,810
But they aren’t anymore?
49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,390
This is a story from
the times of my grandfather…
50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,600
There was a time when the Shinobi
of the Hidden Stone Village
51
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,560
were going to invade the Leaf Village…
52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,100
The Kamizuru Clan was designated
to spearhead the operation…
53
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,270
The plan was to create
a disruption by releasing
54
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,440
a large swarm of bees into the village
followed by an invading main unit…
55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,390
However, the Aburame Clan
wised up to that
56
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,230
and prepared to engage the enemy
in the forest to the west!
57
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,980
This battle between insect handlers
which had no precedent in history…
58
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,400
ended in the Aburame’s victory…
59
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,390
With this battle as the turning point,
60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
the Aburame Clan rose to
unchallenged status
61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,520
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
62
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,390
On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clan
was subjected to cold treatment
63
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,230
even in their own village.
64
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,150
I’ve heard that only a few of them
remain now…
65
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,390
So those people came here
to capture Bikochu, huh?
66
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,390
What the heck are those guys
planning to do with the Bikochu?
67
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,350
If my insects come back
we might be able to learn something…
68
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,440
I see… I've been captured…
69
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,440
The Village Hidden in the Leaves is
in a difficult situation right now…
70
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,190
Because of that incident
at the recent Chunin exam?
71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
The Hokage was assassinated,
and I hear they lost many Shinobi too.
72
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,390
Times are about to change dramatically…
73
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,390
This is a chance for us,
the Kamizuru Clan,
74
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
to distinguish ourselves.
75
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,850
But to do that…
76
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,560
The founder’s Book of Secrets, huh?
77
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,020
A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu
for Insect Handlers
78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,850
are apparently inscribed therein
among other things…
79
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,020
If we possessed that at the time of
the battle with the Aburame Clan,
80
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,390
we wouldn’t have lost…
81
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,390
However, Clan members have continued
to search for it for many years,
82
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,770
but couldn’t find it.
83
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,190
Do you really think
we can find it after all this time?
84
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,390
That’s why we need the Bikochu …
85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,810
I brought the keepsakes
of the founder, my grandfather, with me…
86
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,940
When the Bikochu emerges,
it will pursue the scent it recognizes.
87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,650
And we should be able
to locate the Book of Secrets
88
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,390
that Grandfather hid just
as he was dying.
89
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,390
This strand of his hair
will surely lead us to it.
90
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,020
If we get our hands on
the Book of Secrets
91
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,390
and if we engage in some big action…
92
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,350
I am certain that… the people of
the village will also acknowledge us.
93
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,390
Those people are also desperately
seeking recognition.
94
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,390
Naruto…
95
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,850
Did you find out anything?
How about Hinata’s whereabouts?
96
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,690
No… The other insects were probably
also done in by those guys.
97
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,100
Damn! Then our only choice
is to do what they want?
98
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,390
When I went to all that
trouble of finding it…
99
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,810
So you want to desert Hinata?
100
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,650
H-How could anyone possibly do that?!
101
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,690
I won’t desert her no matter
what might happen!
102
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,390
Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!
103
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,100
Exactly.
104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,810
But then we’d be able to locate Sasuke
if we have this guy here…
105
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,980
Well, I guess we’ll have to think of
some other method of finding Sasuke.
106
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,690
Yeah… Right now, the first thing
we need to do is rescue Hinata.
107
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,900
But, do you think Hinata
would be satisfied with that?
108
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,150
The person who originally
thought up this plan was Hinata.
109
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,690
Huh? But…
110
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,480
It’s true that I told her about
the existence of Bikochu…
111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,730
However…
112
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,270
The odds of finding
a Bikochu are extremely low…
113
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,520
We thought that she should aspire
to an important mission
114
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,310
with an assured outcome for the village,
rather than a mission with such low odds.
115
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,390
But Hinata didn’t give up.
116
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,390
She argued persistently that
if there was even a small possibility,
117
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,520
one should take on the challenge.
118
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,730
Th-That Hinata did…?
119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,480
She was extremely forceful and
Shino and I had no choice but to agree.
120
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,230
It’s the first time Hinata
ever volunteered for a mission.
121
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,020
For that reason too,
I want to make this a success.
122
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,100
Yeah.
123
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,520
But when we don’t know
where Hinata is, how are we…?
124
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,390
There is one place where Hinata
will definitely make an appearance.
125
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,440
I see! The place where…
126
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,150
…the exchange with
the Bikochu takes place!
127
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,390
We will definitely have
a chance at that time.
128
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,150
All right!
We will recover Hinata without fail…
129
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,020
and we will also protect
the Bikochu to the very end!
130
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
We brought the Bikochu!
Return Hinata!
131
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,390
Place the insect cage
on that rock over there!
132
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,770
Hinata!
133
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,940
Release Hinata!
134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,940
I must verify it first!
135
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,980
What’s…the meaning of this?!
136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,390
Are you trying to make a mockery
of our Clan? Of insect handlers?!
137
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,940
A goliath beetle…
You gotta be kidding!
138
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,020
Now, Shino!
139
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,230
What?!
140
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,390
Parasitic Insects!
141
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,390
Heh! Recovery successful!
142
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,350
All right!
143
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,400
Damn!
144
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,940
Naruto!
145
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,350
All right, resign yourselves!
146
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,150
Your time’s up!
147
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,350
What’s this?
148
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,560
This one doesn’t smell like Hinata!
149
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,100
Huh?!
150
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,850
Just as I thought…
151
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,980
Beeswax…?
152
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,730
There they come!
153
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,390
Damn! You jerk! You jerk!
154
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,480
Damn! All these things are honey…?!
155
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,150
Sorry, Naruto…
But these damn bees!
156
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,390
There’s no end to them!
157
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,940
Do we need to slash them
if they’re honey?!
158
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,190
You two don’t move from there!
159
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,440
Huh?
160
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,390
This is the genuine thing!
And furthermore, it contains deadly poison.
161
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,440
It appears that genuine ones
are mixed in…
162
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,230
But they’re indistinguishable
from each other!
163
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,980
Back me up for a little!
164
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,810
Wall of Insects Jutsu!
165
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,390
A-Awesome…
166
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,940
Amazing power for a Genin…
167
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,770
As might be expected from
the Aburame Clan…I guess.
168
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,850
The Kamizuru Clan…
169
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,100
Huh…? So you were aware
of that fact.
170
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,980
Return Hinata!
171
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,650
Of course, our intention was
to return her…
172
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
But only if you calmly hand over
the Bikochu.
173
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,440
However…
174
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,690
It looks like you have
no intention of doing that!
175
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,060
In that case,
what do you plan on doing?
176
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,690
If you’re an insect handler,
177
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,060
you wouldn’t bring a delicate insect
like the Bikochu
178
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,390
to a dangerous place
like a battleground…
179
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,390
We’ll finish you off right here…
180
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,060
and take our time afterwards
to search for the Bikochu!
181
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,310
Wall of Insects Jutsu!
182
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,150
That one doesn’t have
any other tricks, huh!
183
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,390
Shino! Paper Bombs!
184
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,690
Take this!
185
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,190
1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
186
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,390
Insect Clones…?
187
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,390
Up to your annoying tricks, huh…
188
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,810
Shino! What are we gonna do now?!
189
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,150
Don’t you think we should
go back there for a moment?
190
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,390
Those guys
might find the Bikochu!
191
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,900
No…that location will definitely be safe.
192
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,560
More importantly, the first thing
we need to do is search for Hinata!
193
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,480
There’s no mistake.
194
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,390
Inside here.
195
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,940
Hinata! Where are you?!
196
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,390
Hey! Be careful!
197
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,020
There’s no sign of those guys,
but it might be a trap…
198
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,850
Is she there?!
199
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,440
Hinata…?
200
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,650
Hinata!
201
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,350
Are you all right, Hinata?
202
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,390
I’ll rescue you in a moment!
203
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,940
Just a little more!
204
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,810
All right… I got it off!
205
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,810
Naruto…
206
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,770
Thank you!
207
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,390
H-Hinata…?!
208
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,520
H-Hinata…stop that!
209
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,390
What do you think you’re doing,
out of the blue like that?!
210
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,770
Who…are you?
211
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,810
What are you talking about, Shino?
That’s Hinata.
212
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,390
If you’re really Hinata,
213
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,480
you’d get red in the face
and faint if you hugged Naruto.
214
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
– Huh? 					– Oh!
215
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,390
I see… But Akamaru’s nose wouldn’t fail…
216
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,730
What? The smell of two people
is mingled?
217
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,230
You’re not Hinata?
218
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,100
Naruto… It’s me…
I’m Hinata, believe me.
219
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,400
In that case…
220
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,480
show us what you tried to stick
on Naruto’s back right now!
221
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,770
A Paper Bomb?
222
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,230
So you were intending
to blow up Naruto!
223
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,650
I thought that would work…
224
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,650
You are…
225
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
I see, the one on the hill
was a clone, huh…
226
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,390
Wearing Hinata’s clothes…
227
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,810
That’s how she was able
to compromise the smell.
228
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,060
Where is the real Hinata?!
229
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,730
I wonder where she could be?
230
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,520
I see…
231
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,650
Suzumebachi lured
the Aburame Clan, huh?
232
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,520
Well, it appears that your comrades…
233
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,810
place more value on the Bikochu
than on you.
234
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,940
There’s nobody else coming
to rescue you.
235
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,060
Jibachi, Let’s search for
the Bikochu that those guys hid!
236
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,850
There’s not much time until sunrise!
237
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,350
Right!
238
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,390
Don’t even try to escape.
239
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,810
If you make even the smallest movement
out of the ordinary,
240
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,600
those bees will cut the string.
241
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,900
Up ahead is the entrance to
a labyrinthine underground water vein…
242
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,150
If you fall in, you’ll pass into
the other world in an instant.
243
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,850
We don’t wish to kill
anyone unnecessarily.
244
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,230
If you want to live,
I suggest you just stay quiet.
245
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,940
How mortifying… I ended up being
a burden to everyone, after all.
246
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,190
You guys are just like summer insects
who fly right into the fire!
247
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,390
If you’re lucky, we’ll meet again…
248
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,390
That place isn’t just an ordinary cave.
249
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,390
Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!
250
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,390
There’s nothing else to grab on to.
251
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,150
Be patient until I’ve checked
the surroundings!
252
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,520
No!
253
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,650
A huge number of bee larvae!
254
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Bee larvae, huh…?
255
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,390
But what’s with their unusual huge size?
256
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:13,230
If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu,
I’ll spare your life.
257
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,390
I refuse!
258
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,230
Searching for the Bikochu is
the mission that we were given!
259
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,150
Then die!
260
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,520
Paper Bombs!
261
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,150
Damn! Let’s go, Akamaru!
262
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,980
Fang Over Fang!
263
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,350
That sound is…
264
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,520
I see… They’re still continuing to fight
without giving up.
265
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,390
This is not the time to be crying…
266
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,480
There’s no way that I can give up.
I suggested this whole thing!
267
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,270
Byakugan!
268
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,810
There are 13 bees…
attached to the string.
269
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,190
If I can take them all down at once…
I’ll be saved.
270
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,600
But, to take down bees that small…
271
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,730
Impossible! This guy…
272
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:23,190
I told you before…
I don't know…when to give up.
273
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,270
Naruto…
274
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,390
Yes… I won’t give up either!
275
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,690
I need to concentrate and
control my Chakra…
276
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,100
Fang Over Fang!
277
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,400
How many of them are there…?!
278
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,520
Kiba!
279
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,020
I-I can’t muster any strength…
Somehow my body is…
280
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,350
No way!
281
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,270
The larvae in this hive’s favorite food
is Chakra!
282
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,310
What?!
283
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,270
As long as you’re in there,
284
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,810
they’ll go through the wall
to suck up the Chakra…
285
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,560
What’s the matter…?
286
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,230
So have you decided
to tell me the location?
287
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,390
Now!
288
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,810
Four…
289
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,520
Five, six…ten…
290
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,810
Eleven, twelve, thirteen…
291
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,390
Damn!
292
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,440
Summoning Jutsu!
293
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,940
Would you like to be the feed
for the larvae…
294
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,810
or would you like to get out of here
and become the prey of this girl here?
295
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,060
Choose whichever you like!
296
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,190
Crappy news pass us by
297
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,520
And you become speechless
298
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,520
My voice is way too soft
299
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,810
So you don’t answer
300
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,440
You’re crying   Crying alone
301
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,390
What can I do?   I’m crying too
302
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,980
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
303
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:08,230
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
304
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:17,730
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
305
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:26,940
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
306
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:38,690
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
307
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,440
What should I do? My body won’t move.
308
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,390
I proposed this mission myself
wanting to help Naruto, and yet…
309
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,060
I don’t want to end up as
a burden to everyone anymore,
310
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,480
that’s what I aimed for, but …
311
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,400
No, calm down.
312
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,060
I need to concentrate my Chakra
and remember that training!
313
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,770
I have no choice but to do it now!
That is the best I can do right now!
314
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,560
Next time: “Blaze Away, Byakugan!
This is My Ninja Way!!”
//%
1
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,120
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,870
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,660
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,990
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,000
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,450
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,910
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,410
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,870
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,870
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,080
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,750
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,580
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,200
All the kids said
15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,660
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,500
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,830
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,250
into this windless night
19
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,790
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,120
– Sumptuous meal!
– Sumptuous meal!
21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,370
I feel a little thrown off balance.
22
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,500
Let’s regroup, everybody!
23
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,620
Go!
24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,910
I’m itchy, Elder Brother.
25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,990
Yeah, itchy…
26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,910
Huh?!
27
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,200
My punches aren’t having
any effect whatsoever.
28
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,080
Naruto…
29
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,990
This doesn’t look good.
30
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,990
Again!
31
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,250
Huh?
32
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,000
I-It itches, Elder Brother.
33
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,790
Yeah…feels like I’m getting a rash.
34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,990
D-Damn!
35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,540
I’m not done yet!
36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,750
Stop it, Naruto!
37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,580
It’s futile…
38
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,990
– You won't swagger like that for long!
– You won't swagger like that for long!
39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,120
This feels so good!
40
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,040
What’s up with those guys anyway?
41
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,620
You’re an idiot brat as always.
42
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,200
You have it hard, don’t you?
43
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,160
Having to go on a mission
with that failure of a brat.
44
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,580
Don’t you, Iruka?
45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,990
Why, Mizuki?!
46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,990
I’m asking you, please stop
this kind of foolishness!
47
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,750
Are you intending to betray
your comrades from the village again?
48
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,950
Comrades?
49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,160
That's right!
Your comrades from the Leaf Village
50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
with whom you shared
both pleasures and pain!
51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,790
You can understand that,
can’t you?
52
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,950
Comrades…huh?
53
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,200
As usual, you are naïve,
aren’t you…lruka?
54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,750
What I believe in is power!
55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,790
Don’t think you can shackle me with
such vague bonds like that of comrades!
56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,990
Mizuki…
57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,330
I will soon get my hands
on the ultimate power!
58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,990
Lord Orochimaru’s power!
59
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,870
Orochimaru?!
60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,750
Then I’ll teach you a lesson!
61
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,080
About how meaningless it is…
62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,990
that thing you and the other Leaf guys
describe as camaraderie or whatever!
63
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,330
Mizuki…
64
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,950
You were an excellent Shinobi despite
having committed that crime, you…
65
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,620
Don’t talk so knowingly!
66
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,250
Damn! They’re dodging all my attacks!
67
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,250
Iruka, if you insist so much,
why don't you show me?
68
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,790
What degree of feeling
you really have for your comrades…
69
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,910
I wonder whether you’ll really
be able to stop me?
70
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,290
Come!
71
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,620
Wait!
72
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,990
Naruto! Forget about these guys!
Pursue Mizuki!
73
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,250
Damn…!
74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,410
I’m gonna settle this later
without fail!
75
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,870
Elder Brother, that guy went off.
76
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,080
They all went off, didn’t they?
77
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,660
Elder Brother, could this be
a game of hide-and-go-seek?
78
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,990
Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek!
79
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,750
So does that mean we’re “It”?
80
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,500
Those jerks!
81
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,080
Making us “It” without even deciding
by scissors-paper-rock!
82
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,910
– Let's go, Raijin! 					– Okay!
83
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,290
A New Squad!
Two People and a Dog?!
84
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,580
Over here…lruka.
85
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,290
Hurry, Naruto!
86
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,080
Don't be fooled this time!
87
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,000
Shut up! It’s 100 years too soon
to be arguing with me!
88
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,620
I’m telling you,
89
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,750
if you dilly-dally the situation’s gonna
get really troublesome again!
90
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,870
What?!
91
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,990
Found you!
92
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,160
Good job, huh, Elder Brother!
93
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,540
Yeah!
94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,990
I don’t have time to be
dealing with these guys!
95
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,250
Elder Brother, hide-and-go-seek is fun,
but aren’t you getting hungry?
96
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,120
You’re really something,
aren’t you, Raijin?
97
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,660
Leave some for your Elder Brother!
98
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,540
Of course, I will!
99
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,990
Hey, you idiot brothers!
100
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,700
– Huh? 					– Huh?
101
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,990
This is no time to be eating!
102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,700
I’m telling you, it’s foolhardy
to be fighting these guys!
103
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,660
I already know that!
104
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,620
Mizuki! Where are you?!
105
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,540
What’s the matter…lruka?
106
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,370
Weren’t you gonna stop me?
107
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,040
Stop this foolishness, Mizuki!
108
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,250
Come on out, Mizuki!
109
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,450
Always be aware of
an attack from behind…
110
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,660
For a Shinobi,
isn’t that a basic rule?
111
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,540
Nicely done, Iruka.
112
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,330
Pretty good!
113
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,990
Always read behind the surface
of your enemy’s bluffs…
114
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,000
For a Shinobi isn’t that a basic rule?
115
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,000
That’s my line!
116
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,700
What’s that?
117
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,000
A Smoke Bomb?
118
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,870
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
119
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,450
– Come on over! Catch us if you can!
– Come on over! Catch us if you can!
120
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,830
Elder Brother, they’re increasing!
They’re increasing!
121
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,330
Raijin, this must be
super hide-and-go-seek, don’t you think?
122
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,160
Yeah. That’s right!
123
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,990
A decoy strategy, huh?
You thought it through.
124
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,080
We can buy some time this way.
125
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,790
All right, now's our chance…
126
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,500
– Super, super hide-and-go-seek!
– Super, super hide-and-go-seek!
127
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,120
There are,
there are two Old Lady Tsunades!
128
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
You’re talking about
the idiotic strength, huh?
129
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,830
Haven’t you come to
your senses yet?!
130
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,040
Shut up!
131
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,200
Why are you so obsessed with power!
132
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,450
Because that, if anything,
is everything!
133
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,990
Reconsider, Mizuki!
lt isn’t too late yet!
134
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
You are naive!
135
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,000
Don’t you understand the situation?!
136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,370
What’s the matter?
Come on and attack, Iruka!
137
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,120
You’re not my enemy!
138
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,990
You’re my comrade from
the same village!
139
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,620
I told you, I’m tired of that kind of
song and dance!
140
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,200
And moreover…
you’re my colleagu!
141
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,870
You’re a member of the same family
that inherited the same Will of Fire!
142
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,410
Will of Fire, huh?
143
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,910
Yes, that’s right.
144
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,990
Therefore, please stop
the foolishness, Mizuki!
145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,870
It irks me most when
you say things like that!
146
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
Mizuki!
147
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,620
Since we’re old acquaintances
I was gonna kill you quickly.
148
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,160
But now I’ve decided against that.
149
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,870
You’re gonna have some fun…
150
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,870
I’ll give you a taste of how it feels
151
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,120
to be killed slowly by
your so-called comrade!
152
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,990
Hey, Naruto… How long are you
planning to be like that?
153
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,450
It’s just a matter of time till
those guys find you!
154
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,750
I found you!
155
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,660
What?! They found us!
156
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,990
All right! This is it!
157
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,120
Hide-and-go-seek!
158
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,450
Hide-and-go-seek!
159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,410
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
160
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,990
Elder Brother,
super hide-and-go-seek again?
161
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,290
I’m getting bored with this.
162
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,040
Shadow Clone again?!
163
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,370
As always,
you have no new tricks, huh!
164
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,990
Just leave it to me!
165
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,790
All right! Go!
166
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,080
– Okay! 					– Go!
167
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,040
Wh-What?!
168
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,120
What kind of game is this?
169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,330
Wow, they're going so fast.
170
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,290
I see… Not bad.
171
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,750
I-I feel sick… Elder Brother.
172
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,990
I’m woozy…
173
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,990
Now! Catch them!
174
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,200
Huh?!
175
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,990
You jerks…
176
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,990
What do you think you’re doing?
177
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,830
The preparation’s done!
178
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Here it goes!
You fatso Herculean brothers!
179
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,870
Concentrate… I must concentrate…
180
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,500
Stop putting on airs!
181
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,500
A guy like you,
who’s weaker than me!
182
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,660
Yeah! That’s right, isn’t it?!
183
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,290
You always excelled over
anything I did, didn’t you…?
184
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,080
I was always being helped by you,
wasn’t I?
185
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,120
One year has passed already, hasn’t it?
186
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,040
It’s not so easy to laugh,
hiding your sadness.
187
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,160
Your teacher told me that
you are the center of the laughter.
188
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,790
I’m not sad at all!
189
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,950
It’s an honor for Shinobi
to die during their missions!
190
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,040
My dad and mom…
191
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,870
are heroes who protected this village
from the Demon Fox!
192
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
And I am the child of those heroes.
193
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,370
That’s why I’m not sad
even though I’m alone…
194
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,080
These tears are from the happiness...
195
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,660
Enough already.
196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,790
I’m always aware that
you are feeling lonely.
197
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,990
But you are not alone.
198
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,990
All of Leaf’s Shinobi
have the “Will of Fire.”
199
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,120
“Will of Fire”?
200
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,990
It means the will to protect the Leaf.
201
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,660
As long as you have
the Will of Fire,
202
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,790
you and people in this village
are all family.
203
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,000
Iruka, I wonder if you have that.
204
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah.
205
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,910
Huh…?
206
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,750
Who’s that over there?
207
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,580
Mizuki…
208
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,990
What are you doing there?
209
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,040
Well, I heard that Iruka
was depressed these days…
210
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,990
I was worried and came to look for him.
211
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,660
Everybody’s…worried about you, Iruka.
212
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,200
Everybody’s waiting over there.
Come on and play with us!
213
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,540
It’s all right… Go on.
214
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,200
The Mizuki that I idolized was kind…
215
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,990
And he was a guy who was more
thoughtful of his friends than anyone else.
216
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,660
Yet…
217
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,990
Please remember! Mizuki!
218
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,620
You really are…
219
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,660
an idiot, aren’t you?!
220
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,250
L-Let go…
221
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,540
Here it goes…
222
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,990
S-Stop please!
223
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,410
I-I feel sick…
224
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,580
– Huh? 					– Eh?
225
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,990
What?
226
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,330
Elder Brother, don’t tell me that you…
227
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,370
Sorry, Raijin… I squashed…
228
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,000
our lunch!
229
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,450
What?!
230
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,370
Stay still, guys!
231
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,000
Now take this…!
232
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,040
– Give us back our lunch!
– Give us back our lunch!
233
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,120
What?!
234
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,000
H-He’s done it, huh…
235
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,370
It doesn’t look like you understand me,
so let me explain.
236
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,950
The real reason I was kind to you…
237
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,120
Because it made me happy
more than anything
238
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,370
to see you in your misery!
239
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,540
Hey, Iruka!
240
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,410
We’re gonna go play soccer right now.
241
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,330
Come join us, Iruka!
242
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,830
Sure! Okay!
243
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,500
I wonder if Iruka’s okay
244
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,990
after all those things
that happened to him…
245
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,500
That’s why we need to
try to cheer him up!
246
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,410
Why…only him…
247
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,620
Everybody makes a fuss about him
248
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,830
just because of his parents
getting killed by Nine-Tail…
249
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,290
Serves you right…
250
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,910
Even Lord Hokage?!
251
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,580
Why…why is it?!
252
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,330
Who is it over there?
253
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,040
All right…
254
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,160
I’m gonna try to gain the favor
of Lord Hokage too…
255
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,580
What are you doing over there?
256
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,500
Well, I heard that Iruka has been
depressed recently so…
257
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,370
You’re lying!
258
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,540
Treating a guy who’s weaker
than oneself with disdain
259
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,660
is the most pleasurable
feeling of all, Iruka.
260
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,990
You weren’t that way in the past!
261
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,290
That’s why I’ve been telling you…
you’re naïve!
262
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,580
That kind of naiveté leads to fatal mistakes
on the battleground.
263
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,540
On the battleground, it’s all about
how many enemies you can kill!
264
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,160
If you throw a Kunai blindly
in a bamboo grove,
265
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,990
all that will happen is that it’ll bounce off
and its path will be errant.
266
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,990
If you’re gonna take aim…
make it straight!
267
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,950
Don’t think I’m gonna get fooled twice
with the same bait!
268
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,370
Damn… I’m at a disadvantage if
we fight in a place like this!
269
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,120
Mizuki…
270
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,250
You…
271
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,200
Mizuki!
272
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,660
I told you, it’s useless…
273
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,990
If the path is going to be errant,
274
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,160
then one just needs to calculate
the path of the Kunai when throwing it!
275
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,870
So you’ve finally gotten serious, huh?
276
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,410
Follow me!
277
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,700
Where is this?
278
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,990
Looks like you’re finally conscious.
279
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
You jerk…
280
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,870
You ruined our meal…
281
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,990
Don’t even think
we’re gonna let you leave here alive!
282
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,330
I’m going for his stomach!
283
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,950
I’m going for his head!
284
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,830
– One, two… 					– One, two…
285
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,620
– Three! 					– Three!
286
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,410
Huh?
287
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,660
Huh?!
288
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,290
Wh-What is going on?
289
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,040
Gimme a break,
what are you doing?!
290
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,990
Wh-Who’s that?
291
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,990
It’s too much of a drag
to tell you my name, however…!
292
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,080
The most powerful support squad
assigned to this mission!
293
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,990
The most powerful trio from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
294
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,410
We’re Ino-Shika-Cho!
295
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,750
Crappy news pass us by
296
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,080
And you become speechless
297
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,080
My voice is way too soft
298
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,370
So you don’t answer
299
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,000
You’re crying   Crying alone
300
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,990
What can I do?   I’m crying too
301
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,450
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
302
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:07,790
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
303
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:17,290
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
304
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:26,500
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
305
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:38,250
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
306
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,500
What's with these guys?!
They have super ridiculous strength!
307
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,870
To think they can resist
308
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,080
Shadow Possession Jutsu
to this extent on sheer power!
309
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,990
If Shikamaru's Jutsu gets broken now,
we'll be in a hairy spot!
310
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,660
Our only choice is to
settle this right away.
311
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,370
Are you guys ready?
312
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,040
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
313
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,990
Then let's go!
This is our trump card!
314
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,870
Next episode,
"A New Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!"
//%
1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:09,720
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,970
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,260
One more time
4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,970
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,510
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,220
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,890
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:54,760
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:17,970
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,350
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru.
16
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,600
He’ll be getting a mission
after such a long while.
17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,850
What do you mean by a mission?
18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Be careful…
19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,970
It’s the first A-Ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.
20
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,680
Ouch!
21
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,760
You were able to release
the Genjutsu too!
22
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,930
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!
23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,800
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!
24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,890
Then await next orders
in a safe place.
25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,840
Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!
26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,840
I’ll tell you the reason en route!
27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Let’s go!
28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
H-Hey!
29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
I get it! So that’s what happened!
30
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,680
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
31
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,840
So, why am I pulled into this?
This is such a drag!
32
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,430
It can’t be helped!
33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
It’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.
34
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,840
This way!
35
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,840
How long will it be until
we catch up?
36
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,430
I don’t know.
He is moving at a pretty good speed.
37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,300
Dang it!
38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,840
A Shirker’s Call to Action:
Layabout No More!
39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,930
Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.
40
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,390
Huh? What is it?
41
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,430
Did you find Sasuke?
42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
No!
43
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,430
There are eight people in
two squads behind us…
44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,390
No…
45
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,140
There’s one more…
There are nine people following us.
46
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,840
What?!
47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,930
C’mon. Already?!
Give me a break!
48
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,140
It looks they haven’t grasped
our location, yet.
49
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,840
We must lose them.
50
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,840
Hey, what’s the point of stopping?!
51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Shut up and follow me!
52
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,140
Huh?
53
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,550
We’re going back over our footprints.
54
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,720
If we do that,
55
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
it’ll look to them like our footprints
suddenly disappeared.
56
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,800
But, they’ll notice even
if we do this, right?
57
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,840
It’ll buy us some time.
That’s enough.
58
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,390
It’ll be a matter for great celebration
if our pursuers get impatient,
59
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,140
cloud their eyes of pursuit
and lose sight of the trail.
60
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,470
Hurry!
61
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,430
There’s no time.
62
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,720
I-I know!
63
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,050
This is not good.
64
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,220
Though they're on
alert for ambushes,
65
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,890
they’re catching up with us
slowly, but surely.
66
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,600
Dang it!
67
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,350
Probably they’re all Chunin or higher.
68
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,930
We’ll be wiped out if they catch up.
69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Wiped out…
70
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,430
Dang it! Since it’s come to this,
why don’t we ambush them?!
71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Ambush?
72
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,390
Right.
73
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,840
Indeed, an ambush would
be to our advantage.
74
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,100
Even if the opponent has twice
the people than we do,
75
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,180
if we just catch them off-guard…
76
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
That’s no good.
77
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,140
Our opponents are former
Leaf Shinobi Orochimaru’s henchmen.
78
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,800
In the worst case scenario,
there might be Jonin.
79
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,600
I thought it’d work,
but I guess not, huh.
80
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Hold it. Why?
81
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,550
The level of opponent doesn’t have
much to do with an ambush.
82
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,840
What do you mean?
83
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,930
You guys don’t get it.
84
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,390
Listen. Indeed, an ambush is
a very advantageous fundamental tactic.
85
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
But two conditions are necessary.
86
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,840
What are those necessary conditions?
87
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,050
Number one.
88
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,930
The ones on the run must act without
making noise and find the enemy first.
89
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,840
Number two.
90
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,840
One must be able to catch
the pursuers off guard,
91
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
capture a point and position
to be able to inflict certain damage,
92
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,840
and conceal oneself quickly.
93
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,840
Ah… Huh?
94
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,840
An ambush only becomes effective
when these two conditions are ensured.
95
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,850
Well, the first condition
won’t be so difficult
96
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,800
since we have the Ninja Hound’s nose.
97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,800
And the second one also
seems advantageous at a glance
98
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,350
since we know the geography
of our village.
99
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,840
But Orochimaru has spent time
in the Leaf before.
100
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,890
That approach won’t work
on his henchmen.
101
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,100
So what do you really mean?
102
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,220
Our pursuers must have been instructed
in the terrain of this village
103
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,220
and have gone through
simulated practice for this fight.
104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
And on top of that,
105
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,550
they’re probably all Ninja
who have mastered the pursuit arts.
106
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,390
So they know what cards we have, huh.
107
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,890
Well, even so, the fact remains
that an ambush is advantageous.
108
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,100
But there are too many elements
of uncertainty.
109
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,680
In the first place, the enemy is
a special unit organized for this operation.
110
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,850
But we have a fool…
111
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,600
a Kunoichi who’s nothing special…
112
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,800
and one dog…
113
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,840
and, me with the number-one cold feet!
114
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,720
A tactic is grasping the conditions
that are there without fail
115
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
and formulating an optimal plan.
116
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,550
And so, there’s only one thing
that we can do now…
117
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,100
One?
118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,640
A diversion in the guise
of an ambush.
119
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,300
One person will remain,
pretend to ambush,
120
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,010
and delay the pursuers.
121
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,850
In other words…
122
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,800
bait.
123
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,760
Right. If we delay them,
124
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,050
they won’t be able to grasp
the positions of the remaining three.
125
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,600
If we do that, we’ll be able
to shake off our pursuers,
126
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,300
but the one who has become
the bait will probably…
127
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,140
die.
128
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,760
So, who’s going to do it?
129
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,430
We need the dog to follow Sasuke.
130
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,800
That means…
131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,010
Fine…
132
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
– I'll…
– I guess it has to be me.
133
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,970
Shikamaru?!
134
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,220
W-Why you?!
135
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,840
It’s better than being wiped out, right?
136
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Besides, among us,
137
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,220
the only one who is equal
to playing the bait
138
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,050
and who has the possibility
of surviving…
139
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,510
is me.
140
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,350
Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Art
originally intended as a delay tactic, so…
141
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,680
Well, I’ll catch up later!
142
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,680
Now get going!
143
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,300
We’re counting on you, Shikamaru!
144
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,260
Sakura!
145
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,550
Yeah.
146
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,800
Was Shikamaru ever this reliable
of a character?
147
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,300
Be careful…
148
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Shikamaru.
149
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,640
No matter how much you try to erase
the signs of your presence…
150
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
you’re in plain view.
151
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,390
Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.
152
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,840
What did you say?!
153
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,010
I wonder if he’s really
delaying the enemy.
154
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,600
Me with the number-one cold feet!
155
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,350
Don’t tell me, Shikamaru…
156
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,100
Shikamaru will be okay!
157
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Don’t tell me, he ran away.
158
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
I said he’ll be okay!
159
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
What’ll be okay?!
160
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,100
He has a dirty mouth and
always says stuff is a pain.
161
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,350
But he wouldn’t betray us!
162
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,010
He hardly ever says
he’ll do something himself,
163
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,140
but he makes sure to do it
if he says it!
164
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,350
That’s absolute.
165
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I want to believe…
I want to believe, but…
166
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,760
Pick up the pace!
167
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,100
I somehow managed to
get away completely.
168
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,800
Their strides are irregular.
169
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,050
Urgency is probably increasing
their fatigue.
170
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,550
Sorry about that.
171
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,430
I was supposed to be the guy
with the number one cold feet.
172
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,840
It seems my character has
changed just a bit this time.
173
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
The fact that I’m tired is true.
174
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,800
Those footprints are wrong.
175
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,720
By the way, this is what
the dog’s paw print really is.
176
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,350
Oh, he’s still a kid.
177
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,220
To think we’d all get caught like this.
178
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,260
So this is the rumored Leaf Village’s
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?
179
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,140
That’s an old way of saying it!
180
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,850
The times are passing!
181
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,840
It’s called Shadow Possession Jutsu now,
old man.
182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,550
Sure enough,
that match wasn’t good.
183
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,470
I used too much Chakra.
I can’t hang on much longer…
184
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,720
1, 2, 3, 4…
185
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,050
5, 6, 7…8.
186
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,600
Eight people…
187
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,430
Eight… No, there’s one more…
188
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,680
There are nine people following us.
189
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,600
Sure enough, the ninth person’s role is
to protect against them getting ambushed.
190
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,220
That person stays at a fixed distance,
191
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,510
moves in the back and responds
to an enemy attack.
192
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,680
But…this will make clear where
that person’s hiding!
193
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,180
There, huh?!
194
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Dang it… The Shadow won’t reach.
195
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,840
I don’t have the stamina to
send it to Chakra.
196
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,390
It’s futile. I see through your technique.
197
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,840
Is this as far as it goes?
198
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,840
It looks like you’re at your limit…
199
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,850
This Shadow Possession Jutsu
is going to break very soon.
200
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,640
Prepare yourself!
201
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,550
I wanted to…
become a Ninja any which way,
202
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,550
save up money any which way,
203
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,140
get married any which way to
an ordinary woman
204
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,840
who’s neither beautiful nor ugly
205
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,100
and have two kids any which way.
206
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,760
First will be a girl, and then a boy…
207
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,510
I would retire from being a Ninja
when my eldest daughter marries
208
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,100
and my son becomes a full-fledged man.
209
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,050
And then I take it easy
in my life of retirement
210
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,680
playing Japanese chess
and Go the whole day.
211
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,840
Then I die of old age before my wife.
212
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,010
Such a life would’ve been nice.
213
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,850
I was out of character,
I tried too hard this time.
214
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,640
I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.
215
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,680
What I did was a drag…
216
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,850
Hmm, the movements of
our pursuers have stopped.
217
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,180
Yes! The delaying was a success!
218
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,930
Shikamaru, eh?
219
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,050
I’m sorry I doubted you, even a little.
220
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,840
Okay!
221
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,970
Now…you wait, Sasuke.
222
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,840
And…Shikamaru…
223
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,180
Live, and catch up to us no matter what!
224
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,760
As you say, it seems I’m at my limit.
225
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,720
Hey, come on out.
226
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,260
While you’re at it, cut off his head.
227
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,350
I finally caught up.
228
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,840
A-Asuma?! Why?
229
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,510
Well done, Shikamaru.
230
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,140
Sure enough, out of character.
231
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,840
For the time being, you retire here.
232
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,470
Hurry!
233
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,850
What a pest.
234
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,640
The pursuers have increased?
Two? No, three?
235
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,180
Kankuro! Pick up the pace!
236
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,010
Okay.
237
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,430
I won’t let you get away.
238
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,180
Don’t jump the gun, Sasuke.
239
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,840
Sasuke.
240
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,850
Now then, shall we begin?
241
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:28,050
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
242
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:39,390
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
243
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:55,050
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
244
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,100
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
245
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,510
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
246
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,760
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
247
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
248
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:31,720
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
249
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:42,260
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
250
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,840
Forge on strong
251
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,050
I don’t know what’s going on!
252
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,840
Why is Old Man Hokage
fighting with Orochimaru?
253
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,300
Why is Sasuke going after
that guy with shadows around his eyes?
254
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,840
I don’t understand why we have
to go after him,
255
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,760
but that’s what we have to do right now!
256
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Wait up, Sasuke!
257
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,390
Next time: “An Unrivaled Match:
Hokage Battle Royale!”
258
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,430
What the heck’s happening
to the village?!
//%
1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:09,810
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:18,060
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,360
One more time
4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,060
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,610
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,310
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,980
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,610
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:54,850
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,850
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,900
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:18,060
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,850
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,900
One more time
15
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,360
That darn Naruto…
16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,230
Zero Motivation:
The Guy with Cloud Envy!
17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,810
– C’mon!
– Hurry up with the match!
18
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,980
Finish it up already!
19
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,940
Stand up and start the match!
20
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,850
Evidently, people don’t want to
see the minor players’ matches
21
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,020
since they were really looking
forward to Sasuke’s match…
22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,650
If people aren't expecting anything
exciting from this battle,
23
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,850
makes no sense
for me to have it.
24
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,520
What? You’re giving up, too?
25
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,850
My opponent’s a girl again?
26
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,440
Hey, why aren’t you moving?!
27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,520
C'mon, get started!
28
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,480
That kid has had zero fighting spirit
from the beginning…
29
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,400
C’mon! What is he doing?!
30
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,650
C’mon Shikamaru!
Get it together and do it!
31
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,940
If you don’t come, I’ll go!
32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,560
Hey! Haven’t started yet…
33
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,850
Man, that girl is so gung-ho.
34
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,730
It doesn’t really matter if
I become a Chunin or not.
35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,850
But there's no reason why
a man should lose to a woman.
36
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,980
Well… let’s do it!
37
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,850
This guy’s quick to run away…
38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,400
Nor any reason why a man should
rough up a woman.
39
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,850
But I don’t want to be
roughed up either.
40
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,560
He’s the kind of Ninja that
uses shadows.
41
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,730
Shadow Possession Jutsu.
42
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,850
He’s probably trying to lure me into
the trees where there're lots of shadows…
43
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,770
but I won’t let him.
44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,190
Why am I the only one who always
gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!
45
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:54,020
Shikamaru! You get her with
a torrent of 16 combination…!
46
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,770
Mind if I sit here?
47
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,610
Huh?
48
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,650
What…you?
Your stomach okay?
49
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,860
What? Wasn’t Sasuke’s match next?
50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,230
Shh!
51
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,230
Everything’s fine, right, Sakura?
After all, it's Sasuke, right?
52
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,650
R-Right now, I should leave her alone.
53
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,440
It looks like Shikamaru taking part
in this final battle,
54
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,520
it seems like he's in the wrong place.
55
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,400
Don’t say that!
56
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,980
I certainly don’t think that
he has any great techniques,
57
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,060
but that Shikamaru is
always good at strategizing.
58
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,310
That’s why I feel like we ended up
in the preliminary round the other day.
59
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,770
Hmm, yeah well…
60
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,900
And after all, he jumped down
into the arena himself.
61
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,860
He seems uncharacteristically driven.
62
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,190
Even he can be passionate
once in a while!
63
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,310
Go! Shikamaru!
64
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,940
Geez, I envy a cloud being so free…
65
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,150
I guess I pretty much
am completely without desire…
66
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,770
Even the reason why I became a Ninja…
67
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,770
was because I thought
I would have a fun life, ya know…
68
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,980
Get it together!
69
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,860
C’mon Shikamaru!
70
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,940
But…of course, it’s not that easy.
71
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,850
What’s going on with that stupid face?!
ls he underestimating me?
72
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,850
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
73
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,980
That’s right, with this attack,
my armed attacks also were beaten down.
74
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,810
I see…
75
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,110
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
I’ve seen that true identity!
76
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,650
Evidently there’s a limit to
the stretching and shortening,
77
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,110
changing shape of the shadow…
78
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,810
No matter how much you
change the shape of the shadow,
79
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,810
even when you stretch it,
80
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,560
it can only span up to
the size of your own shadow.
81
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,560
That’s right isn’t it?
82
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,520
You got it…
83
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,520
Even if I assume that he's made up
the distance,
84
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,110
by stretching his shadow from the edge
of the shadow of the arena wall…
85
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,150
This is the limit to how far
the shadow can stretch.
86
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,810
This is the scope of his attack!
87
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,440
15 meters, 32 centimeters!
88
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,310
She took the distance
with the folding fan.
89
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,230
Temari is stronger at long distance
battles than she is at close range…
90
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,150
the outcome has already been decided.
91
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,810
What? What is that sign…?
92
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,770
That’s no sign. That’s like, his habit.
93
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,940
Habit…?
94
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,690
He enjoys passing time slowly.
That guy’s like an old man.
95
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,360
That’s why he likes
Japanese checkers and chess
96
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,360
and always makes me be his opponent.
97
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,850
When he’s stuck on a move,
he always does that.
98
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,190
Why?
99
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,230
He’s working out his strategy.
100
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,400
And, I’ve never beaten him.
101
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,690
A strategy…
but this is an actual fight.
102
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,480
It’s different from a game.
103
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,060
But it's said that formation pieces
that were used to build battle strategy
104
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,440
eventually become
game pieces.
105
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,520
Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.
106
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,150
Wait a minute.
107
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,850
When we grouped the Genin,
I saw his scores.
108
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,980
They were at about the
same level of that Naruto’s.
109
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,860
He said that moving his pencil during
written exams at the academy is a pain,
110
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,690
and during the tests,
he always sleeps instead.
111
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,810
A pain…?
112
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,150
He was so good at strategy games,
I felt something wasn’t right…
113
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,850
so I had him take an IQ test
under the pretense that it was a game.
114
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,610
And… how did it turn out?... …
115
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,850
He was more than brilliant.
116
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,400
With an IQ of over 200,
he’s a super genius!
117
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,690
T-Two hundred?!
118
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,440
He’s done thinking…
lt starts now.
119
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,230
Looks like you’ve got some
fighting spirit now…
120
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,360
It’s pointless to hide!
121
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,850
I wonder if he’s really got a strategy…
122
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,270
M-Maybe…
123
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,860
With that he has no approach!
124
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
Shikamaru! Go for it!
125
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,400
It’s pointless, isn’t it?
126
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,690
He’ll give up soon.
127
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,150
He hates things
that are a pain in the butt.
128
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,190
You're wrong!
At least, I hope so…
129
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,610
But you may be right…
130
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,270
How long are you going to run away!
Cut it out!
131
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,150
It’s no use.
132
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,360
As long as I’m on the
outside of this line,
133
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,850
he absolutely can’t catch me…
134
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,900
No, wait! Close call!
135
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,190
You caught on well.
136
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,850
So you were dragging your feet
to wait for the sun to set…
137
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,610
in order to make the surface
of your own shadow larger
138
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,650
by stretching the shadow line of the wall.
139
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,850
As the sun goes down,
the shadows lengthen.
140
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,850
Isn't that so?
141
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,810
That was close! Shikamaru…
142
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,850
But why is he using shadows?
143
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,520
After all, Shikamaru is inside
the shadow of the field.
144
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,850
If there’s even a little bit of light,
he can make a shadow within a shadow!
145
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,440
You don’t know a thing
about Shikamaru!
146
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,360
A shadow…in a shadow…?
147
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,900
Even if I calculate the height
of the sun now
148
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,850
and the limit to the distance
of the previous attack,
149
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,020
there's no mistaking the distance!
150
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,400
Temari! Up!
151
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,980
I see.
152
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,560
What’s this?!
153
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,850
Darn it!
154
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,520
I won’t let you escape!
155
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,310
I didn’t expect that he would
create extra shadows to reach me
156
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,020
by making a parachute with his jacket…!
157
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,810
He’s impressive.
158
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,610
Once I notice the parachute from above,
I’ll take my attention off from my feet.
159
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,850
That’s a sneaky trick to catch me
off my guard!
160
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,520
However, now it’s clear.
161
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,650
Shadow Possession Jutsu is
162
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,360
one in which other shadows are used
to get your opponent,
163
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,850
a skillful technique!
164
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,940
She’s dodged this trick too…
165
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,860
Not careful enough in the final stage.
166
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,810
And his opponent is fairly analytical.
167
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,860
She’s good at thinking ahead.
168
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,270
If this battle takes too long,
169
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,060
the shadows in the arena will grow,
and his territory will increase.
170
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,520
I’ll defeat him with the next one!
171
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,810
Should I make a diversion
with Clone Jutsu…?
172
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,690
Now his shadow is…
173
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,190
Okay!
174
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,270
Clone…
175
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,860
N-No way…!
176
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,810
My... body is…?!
177
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,850
At last…
Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
178
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,440
What?!
179
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,940
What’s going on…?
180
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,480
That boy…
181
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,610
How much is he planning ahead…?
182
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,850
That’s Shikamaru’s skill.
183
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,360
Why…won’t my body move?!
184
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,230
The shadow shouldn’t
have reached this far.
185
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,110
I'll let you take a look behind you…
186
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,480
T-This hole…!
187
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,360
You saw it too, didn’t you…?
188
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,440
That hole is the hole Naruto
burrowed and flew out of.
189
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,770
So it’s connected to the
big hole in front of you.
190
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,850
I didn’t expect that…
a shadow in a tunnel of a hole…
191
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,900
Right.
192
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,980
Pure and simple,
a calculated chess move.
193
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,810
So his purpose to make Temari measure
the limit of the shadow several times
194
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,230
was to lead her to his final trick
of using this hole.
195
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,480
Temari battled on the outside
of the limit of the shadow
196
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,690
that she measured and followed,
197
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:32,980
but he caught her from behind,
trailed by the shadow she couldn’t see…
198
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,690
There is no escape from this.
199
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,810
I-It can’t be…
200
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,610
The attack that he used
with the jacket,
201
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,520
was it a device to lead me
to right this spot…?
202
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,560
Was that an underplot too?!
203
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,730
Why that--?!
204
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,850
Checkmate with the next one.
205
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,810
My body is moving on its own!
I can’t resist it!
206
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,770
Before anyone knew it,
they fell under the spell of this match.
207
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,480
That guy with no mark
is quite a darkhorse.
208
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,900
Yes! You did it!
209
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,690
Go! Shikamaru!
210
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,150
Check…
211
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,560
Good grief… I give up!
212
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,900
What?!
213
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,360
See I told you…he’d give up.
214
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,310
Ino doesn’t know anything
about Shikamaru.
215
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,730
W-What did you say?!
216
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,940
I’ve used too much Chakra from Shadow
Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.
217
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,060
I can’t hold it another 10 seconds.
218
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,190
I thought of the next trick 200 times.
219
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,850
But I’m out of time…
220
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,230
This has become such a pain.
221
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,980
Doing one match is good…
222
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,270
That guy is a strange one.
223
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,560
The winner is Temari!
224
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,650
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
225
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,900
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
226
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,520
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
227
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,850
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
228
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,190
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
229
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:53,560
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
230
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,400
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
231
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,850
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
232
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,060
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
233
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,480
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
234
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:23,770
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
235
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:31,020
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
236
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:37,690
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
237
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:44,850
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
238
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,270
Wow, this is the largest cheer
from the audience ever!
239
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,730
Of course. The featured battle
of this final tournament is about to begin.
240
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,810
Hate to admit it,
but I'm looking forward to it myself.
241
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,060
Hey, Shikamaru.
I can't hear what you said.
242
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:09,850
There's not a single person who's
not excited about the featured battle.
243
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,860
Next: "Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"
244
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,850
I can't take my eyes
away from this battle!
//%
1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,730
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:17,980
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,280
One more time
4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,980
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,230
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,900
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:45,530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,770
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,770
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,820
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,980
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,820
One more time
15
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,690
Hey! Open up!
16
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,190
Huh?
17
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,280
What’s all this noise at this hour?
18
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,570
Idiots! I told you not to let
your eyes off him, didn’t I?
19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,360
Could Gaara have…?
20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,860
Where on earth did he go?
21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,480
I hope nothing bad happens, but…
22
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,980
Hospital Beseiged:
The Evil Hand Revealed!
23
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,730
Wow, he’s sound asleep…
I wonder if he’s dead?
24
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,610
If that’s for Sasuke,
he’s not back yet.
25
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,400
Hmm.
26
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,530
Ino…
27
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,980
I’m way ahead of you on
Sasuke information.
28
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,280
Missed your chance on that one,
eh, Billboard Brow?
29
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,070
No! This is for Lee!
30
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,770
Huh?
31
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,780
The one from before should
be wilted by now too…
32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,530
Oh.
33
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,770
Lee! Stop it!
34
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,860
191…
35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,770
Don’t touch me!
36
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,480
I’m…not…done yet…
37
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,770
Here.
38
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,730
Thanks.
39
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,530
I hope Lee’s better.
40
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,770
Yeah.
41
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Huh?
42
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,360
What the…?
43
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,770
Oh man, it’s all clogged up.
What a drag…
44
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,650
Yo!
45
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,770
You finally woke up, eh?
46
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,030
Where…am I?
47
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,320
In the hospital!
48
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,770
They told me that you’ve been
sound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights!
49
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,770
Three days…
50
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,860
Three days and three nights?!
51
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,730
W-What?
52
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,530
Shikamaru! When does
the final competition start?
53
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,770
T-Tomorrow.
54
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,110
What?!
55
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,770
Why didn’t you wake me
up earlier!
56
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,280
I can’t be just snoozing through
in a place like this!
57
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,770
And what about Pervy Sage?
58
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,650
Where’s Pervy Sage?!
59
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,770
I’ve got to have him watch
over my training.
60
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,980
Huh? What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?
61
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,770
I don’t know what’s got into you.
62
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,360
Huh? My clothes are missing!
63
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Where are they?
Where, where?
64
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,280
– Sleeping away like you’re in a coma,
– Gone!
65
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,150
– then running around out of control.
– Where're my clothes?!
66
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,480
Settle down a little!
67
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,820
You know what?
lt isn’t gonna make a difference
68
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,610
if you rush around
one day beforehand.
69
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,650
Resting is training, too, you know…
70
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,320
Huh? Hey…Naruto.
71
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,570
What in the world
is going on?
72
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,820
I’m…so…hungry….
73
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,150
Don’t keep scaring me like that…
74
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,690
Oh yeah.
75
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,320
It’s such a drag but…
76
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,940
I bought this fruit basket as
a get-well present for Choji.
77
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,980
But the doctor said he couldn’t have it.
78
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,440
So let’s eat it together.
79
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,820
Choji? Is he that sick?
80
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,770
No, no, don’t be fooled.
81
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,770
He got sick from eating
too much BBQ.
82
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,070
That’s just like him!
83
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,940
Yeah well, and neither of you are the type
to have female visitors.
84
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,150
So here…
85
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,440
Looks good.
86
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,570
W-What is it?
87
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,780
Since Choji can’t have any,
let’s eat in front of him.
88
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,690
What a drag this guy is!
89
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,900
Huh?
90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,650
No one’s here.
91
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,770
Out to lunch?
92
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,280
Oh well…
93
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,770
Okay!
94
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,780
Hmm?
95
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,360
Lee, I’m putting the
flowers here, okay?
96
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,570
I’m still hungry!
97
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,780
Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?
98
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,070
Oh yeah.
99
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,770
Why…save him?
100
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,150
He’s an important subordinate
whom I care for.
101
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,770
My body…isn’t moving.
102
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,150
You jerk!
103
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,770
What the hell do you think
you’re doing?!
104
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,940
Hey Naruto…
105
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,690
During Shadow Possession Jutsu,
it’s moving me too! Okay?!
106
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,820
Sorry! Shikamaru.
107
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,570
What the hell were you
trying to do?
108
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,770
Choji, are you better?
109
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,610
Oh, Ino!
110
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,780
All right! The age of
the chubby has arrived!
111
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,940
What were you trying to do
to Bushy Brow here?!
112
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,770
I was trying to kill him.
113
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,030
What?!
114
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,070
How can he be so calm?
115
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,730
Especially when he is not able to
move with my Shadow Possession Jutsu…
116
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,190
Why’d you have to do something
like that?
117
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,070
You beat him in the match, right?
118
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,770
Do you have a personal grudge
against him or something?
119
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,320
I don't have anything like that.
120
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,650
I just wanted to kill him, that’s it.
121
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,820
How can you say something
so selfish, you bastard?!
122
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,400
You…you had a lousy upbringing,
didn’t you?
123
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,770
All you care about is yourself.
124
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,730
Or there’s something weird about him.
lt gives me the chills!
125
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,820
If he tries anything, it’ll be too much
of a burden for me and Naruto…
126
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,150
What the heck should we do?
127
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,070
If you get in my way,
I’ll kill you both too.
128
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,030
What?! Go ahead, if you can!
129
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,690
Hey Naruto, hold on!
130
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,820
Should I try to scare him with a bluff?
131
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,610
I know you’re strong from seeing you
in the competition with him…
132
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,480
But…we can keep up with you.
133
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,770
We didn’t show you our best skills
in the preliminaries.
134
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,150
And it’s two against one!
135
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,360
You’re the one who’s at a disadvantage.
136
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,770
If you’re smart, you’ll do what
I tell you and just get lost.
137
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,480
I’ll say it again…
if you get in my way…
138
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,650
I’ll kill you.
139
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,900
Where the heck do you get off…?!
140
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,860
There’s no way in hell
I’ll let you do that!
141
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,610
I’ve been telling you
to back off, haven’t I?
142
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,320
This guy has the strength of a monster.
You get it, don’t you?
143
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,280
I have a real monster in me!
I’m not going to lose to this guy!
144
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Huh?
145
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,360
I heard Naruto was here too,
so I came to see, but…
146
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,570
What a mess…
147
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,770
Well, I guess this means he’s okay.
148
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,770
Huh?
149
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,770
What’s worth making him mad,
you idiot!
150
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,980
A monster, huh…?
151
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,230
Me too, actually.
152
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,770
It’s just like you said.
I had a terrible upbringing.
153
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,770
When I came into this world,
154
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,610
I took the life of the woman
some might call my mother.
155
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,650
So that I could become
the strongest Shinobi…
156
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,230
my father brought his
Ninjutsu upon me,
157
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,610
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.
158
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,770
I was born a monster.
159
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,360
A Sand Spirit?
160
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,980
It's called Shukaku, the living wraith of
an old monk
161
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,770
from Village Hidden in the Sand
who was sealed inside the tea caldron.
162
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,650
It must be a type of
cacodemon possession Jutsu,
163
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,190
performed to a baby before it is born.
164
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,360
To go that far…
they must have been totally nuts.
165
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,110
Is it possible…that there could be
something inside him too?
166
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,530
What a thing for a parent to be doing!
Such a twisted kind of love.
167
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,360
Love?
168
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,320
Don’t measure me by your standards.
169
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Family, huh…
170
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,230
Let me tell you what kind of ties
I have to my family.
171
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,530
They’re ties of hatred,
ties of murderous intent…
172
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,480
My family’s just lumps of flesh.
173
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,770
Nourished with the life of my mother,
174
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,070
I was crafted as the
ultimate masterpiece of the village…
175
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,770
The Kazekage’s child.
176
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,530
I was taught by my father
the innermost secrets of the Shinobi…
177
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,150
spoiled, over-protected,
and left on my own.
178
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,610
And I thought that was love…
179
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,360
Until that incident happened.
180
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,770
That incident…?!
181
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,770
What are you talking about?
182
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,780
Just what happened?!
183
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,770
In the six years since the time
when I was 6 years old…
184
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,400
My real father has tried to assassinate me
more times than I can count!
185
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,360
But I thought you just said that
your father spoiled you…
186
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,150
What’s going on here?
187
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,650
Those who are too strong are
apt to become feared.
188
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,770
Born through the Jutsu,
my mind was unstable…
189
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,940
I guess the idiots in my village
190
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,980
finally realized that
I had emotional problems…
191
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,280
For my father, Kazekage,
192
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,190
at the same time I was
the ultimate weapon for the village,
193
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,940
I was also a dangerous,
fearsome presence.
194
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,770
It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure
as soon as I turned six.
195
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,940
And I was treated politely simply because
I was feared.
196
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,400
To them, now I’m just a relic of the past
that they want to see disappear.
197
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,780
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?
198
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,480
When I asked myself that,
I couldn’t find the answer.
199
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,770
But, as long as you’re alive,
you need a reason…
200
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,770
If you don’t have one,
it’s just the same as being dead.
201
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,070
What’s this guy saying?
202
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,770
I…can understand that…
203
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,780
He…is the same as me.
204
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,860
So this is the answer I came to…
205
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,690
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.
206
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,570
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,
207
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,610
finally I became calm.
208
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:28,280
By killing assassins, I finally
comprehended the reason why I live…
209
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,770
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself…
210
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,770
And if I see that all other people
in this world exist
211
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,770
only to make me realize that,
212
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,150
there could be no world
more wonderful.
213
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,530
And as long as there are
others to kill
214
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,400
who can make me feel
this happiness to be alive,
215
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,900
I will never disappear.
216
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,070
W-What’s this freak talking about…?
217
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,860
He’s real gone!
218
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,110
I was also alone…
219
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,820
And suffered ‘cause
I didn’t know why I was alive…
220
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,280
But Iruka Sensei recognized me
for who I was…
221
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,770
and that was the first time
I realized why I lived…
222
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,900
But this guy…
this guy grew up alone.
223
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,770
And he ony feels alive
when he kills other people.
224
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,730
H-How can there be someone like this?
225
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,150
The worlds we live in
are too different…!
226
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,860
There’s no way…
that I can beat a guy like this!
227
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,730
W-What’s wrong, Naruto?
228
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,770
What? Shadow Possession Jutsu should
have stopped him from moving, but…
229
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,770
Naruto!
230
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,030
Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!
231
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,110
What a drag this guy is!
232
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,570
Naruto!
233
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,320
Now, let me feel it…!
234
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,770
Oh no!
235
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,230
Stop right there!
236
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,360
Tomorrow’s the final round!
237
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,570
There’s no need to rush like this!
238
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,770
Or do you just want to
stay here starting today?
239
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,770
Don’t leave me alone!
240
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,530
I’m not bleeding, but
it hurts a lot right here.
241
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,610
What…am I?!
242
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,110
I will…kill you all without a fail.
243
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,440
Just wait.
244
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,570
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
245
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,820
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
246
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,440

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,770
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
248
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:46,110
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
249
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
250
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,320
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
251
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,770
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
252
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,980
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,400
Four! Japanese people,

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,690
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
255
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,940
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
256
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:37,610
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
257
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:44,770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
258
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,150
Hey! Konohamaru!
How could this be the ace route?!
259
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,770
I'm already late!
260
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,650
And you're making me later
by taking a longer route to get to the field!
261
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,280
The final competition
will start anytime now.
262
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,770
Darn it!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
263
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,280
Run, run, run, run!
264

Next time, "The Final Rounds:
Rush to the Battle Arena!"
265
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,480
I can't trust your "ace" route at all!
//%
1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:09,650
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:17,900
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,190
One more time
4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,900
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,440
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,150
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,820
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,440
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:54,690
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:02,770
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,770
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,900
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:26,770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,770
One more time
15
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,770
Tomorrow, huh…
16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,770
The Final Rounds:
Rush to the Battle Arena!
17
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,360
What’s up? It’s been a while.
18
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,320
Heh-heh…
I was kind of in the hospital.
19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
The hospital?
20
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,770
I’m totally fine, now.
21
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,770
Nothing to it!
22
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,940
I see.
23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,070
Ayame!
24
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,770
Yes!
25
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,280
Here you go.
26
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,400
Pops?
27
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,150
Just eat it.
28
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,730
The final round is tomorrow, right?
29
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,610
Okay, then.
30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,320
Thanks!
31
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,690
You’ve got a daughter at home,
so it’s not so bad, right?
32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,900
Most of my money vanishes
with the food expenses.
33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,770
Moron. Your home is special, right?
34
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,730
Huh?
35
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,440
Girls are a drag.
36
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,770
Yeah. There are times when I really
don’t get how to act with her.
37
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,770
Father’s have it rough…
38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,770
Hah, am I the only bad guy?
39
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,650
Hey, master.
40
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,530
Let me have everything
on these two pages, too!
41
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,770
Welcome!
42
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,820
Oh! Strong reinforcements!
43
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,770
Come on. You order something, too!
44
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,770
Hey…Dad.
45
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,110
Hmm?
46
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,400
Hey! Let’s go home, already!
47
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,770
Excuse me?
48
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,900
Shut up. You’re supposed to
live it up at a festival!
49
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,230
Festival, my butt…
50
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,900
What a drag.
51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,070
You idiot… Since olden times…
52
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,820
the final round’s
been like a festival!
53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,770
I’m in that final round tomorrow.
54
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,820
Jeez, don’t make come to get you.
55
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,480
You’re…in it?
56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,230
Please, Dad…
57
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,770
Tomorrow, eh…
58
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,530
Yeah.
59
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,690
Tomorrow…is a full moon…
60
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,690
To think you didn’t even
get a scratch…
61
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,820
Perfect, eh, Neji?
62
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,440
That’s enough warm-up exercise…
63
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,690
Shall we get going?
64
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,610
I was nervous and couldn’t sleep.
65
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,770
First…it’s him…
in the first match.
66
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,770
Quite honestly…even my Sharingan
can’t see through his Tenketsu!
67
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,820
The strongest man in the
Leaf is on my team.
68
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,820
It is that…Neji Hyuga!
69
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,480
Neji…Neji…Neji…
70
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,320
At last…
71
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,940
The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!
72
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,650
Yeah. He’s the number one rookie
from last year, right?!
73
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,650
We can’t miss the first match!
74
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,230
Neji…Hyuga…
75
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,820
Now I can summon a frog…
lt’ll be okay.
76
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,770
They all…look nasty.
77
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,150
Hinata!
78
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,770
Yipes! N-N-Naruto.
79
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,360
W-What are you doing here?
80
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,440
Today is the final round, isn’t it?
81
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,190
I… Just something…
82
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,610
I came to check out this training field.
83
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,280
This is the place where
I became Genin, so…
84
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,190
Really? W-Why?
85
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,770
N-Nothing…That doesn’t matter!
86
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,190
Y-You’re right. I’m sorry.
87
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,610
Say, Hinata…
88
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,940
Neji’s a relative of yours, right?
89
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,320
Y-Yes.
90
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,280
Is he really strong …?
91
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,190
Yes…
92
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,190
I see.
93
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,400
B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.
94
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,150
Yeah. I’m strong, after all!
95
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,440
I bet you can win, Naruto.
96
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,480
What?
97
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,030
You know…
98
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,770
I…when you cheered for me,
99
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,770
I felt like I was able to become
stronger than before.
100
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,070
Hinata! Hang tough!
101
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,770
When the preliminaries ended,
102
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,770
I became able to like
myself just a little.
103
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,860
I'll…
104
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,360
stand…
105
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,770
by my own…
106
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,360
words.
107
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,770
That is my way of Ninja.
108
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,770
From someone else's standpoint,
it might not look like anything’s changed…
109
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,110
but I feel like I was able to change.
110
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,070
I’ve been thinking that it was…
thanks to you, Naruto.
111
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,480
Say, Hinata…
112
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,360
Did you really think so?
113
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,480
What?
114
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,730
I may look strong to you,
115
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,530
but all I do is mess up…
116
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,610
And I act tough because
I’m frustrated.
117
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,110
It’s not like that!
118
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,770
Even when you messed up,
119
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,770
in my view…you were always
a proud failure.
120
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,110
W-When I look at you,
it impacts my heart.
121
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,770
You’re not perfect, so…
122
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
So…
123
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,980
It’s because you mess up…
124
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,770
that you have the strength
to rise up from that.
125
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,780
I think such strength is
true strength.
126
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,780
I…I think you’re an
incredibly strong person.
127
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,110
Thanks, Hinata!
128
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,150
Even though I was always
the bottom one…
129
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,940
I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!
130
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,860
I was depressed,
which was totally not my character.
131
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,770
But I feel better now!
132
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,980
Naruto…
133
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,110
Okay! I’m off to the match!
134
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,770
Hinata…
135
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,820
Huh?
136
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,780
I kind of…thought you were…
137
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,780
W-What…?
138
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,780
…gloomy, hesitant and weird.
139
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,770
Naruto…
140
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,190
But I quite like…people…
141
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,980
like you!
142
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,610
…like you!
143
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,770
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me
kick that Neji’s butt!
144
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,770
Uh-oh. Time to run!
145
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,230
I-I’m late, late!
146
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,650
See you later, Hinata!
147
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,190
Sorry I’m late, Hinata.
148
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,770
Well, Shino’s match isn’t until
quite a bit later, so…
149
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,770
Hm? Hey? Hinata?
150
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,900
Hmm? W-What?
151
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,230
Oh, it’s starting!
152
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,230
Move, move!
153
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,730
C'mon, move!
154
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,320
Dang it! There’s quite a distance!
155
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,730
I won’t make it!
156
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,610
Brother Naruto!
157
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,280
Konohamaru?!
158
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,190
I’ve come to aid in brother’s crisis, here!
159
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,780
Konohamaru…
What’re you doing here?!
160
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I’ll tell you later!
161
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,980
This way, here!
162
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,770
There’s an ace shortcut where
you can get straight to the arena, here!
163
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
What?!
164
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,230
All right!
Well done, Konohamaru!
165
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,190
Those who control the
secret path control time.
166
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Oh, I see!
You’re awesome, Konohamaru!
167
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,610
As I recall, there’s a hole
in the wall around here…
168
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,770
Oh!
169
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,030
Here it is!
170
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,770
Oh!
171
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,980
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
172
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,860
The secret path has been repaired, here!
173
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,400
Whaat…?
174
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,900
Oh! There’s no time!
175
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,940
Brother!
176
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,570
Next approach!
177
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,690
Look! I’m really out of time.
178
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,730
It’s a secret, but there’s
an awesome path
179
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,820
that can get you inside the arena
in an instant, here!
180
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,320
What?! All right!
Well done, Konohamaru!
181
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,980
This hole is a shortcut?
182
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,730
It’s a straight shot to
the final round arena!
183
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,440
No doubt, here!
184
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,480
Straight shot, huh? 					Okay!
185
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,360
Let’s hurry!
186
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,400
Yeah!
187
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,940
Konohamaru!
What’s happening here?!
188
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,570
It’s okay, here!
189
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,770
We’re almost to the final
round arena, here!
190
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,070
See? There’s the exit, here!
191
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,280
Oh, oh.
192
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,820
What?!
193
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,440
Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!
194
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,780
T-This is…some kind of mistake!
195
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,770
Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!
196
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,820
What the heck are you doing?!
197
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,400
We’ve gotten further
and further away!
198
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,320
Until just recently,
199
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,820
it was connected to the
final round arena, here.
200
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,480
Next approach, right away…
201
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,320
This is it!
202
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,780
If you ride this, you’ll get to the
final round arena just like that, here!
203
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,030
Huh? A bull?
204
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,610
Think again, brother.
205
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,480
A feudal lord Bull is not at all in
the same league as ordinary cows, here.
206
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,980
Once they start running,
even race horses grow deathly pale.
207
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,770
There’s no way they can beat
a no-nonsense feudal lord cow!
208
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,280
Anyway, it’s an awesome cow!
209
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,530
Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,
210
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,940
it’s just a short run to
the final round arena, here!
211
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,280
Then, I’m counting on you.
212
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,070
Okay, let’s go!
213
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,820
Huh? Wha--?!
214
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,650
Ouch!
215
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,770
What?
216
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,770
Brother, go for it, here!
217
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,820
Hey! Stop! Stop!
218
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,650
Hey-hey, we’re missing quite
a few people.
219
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,770
What’s going on?
lt’s going to start.
220
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,690
What’s the meaning of this?
Sasuke…?
221
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,980
And even Naruto…
222
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,940
Why is it?!
223
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,320
This is bad!
224
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,770
That's it!
225
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,770
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
226
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,030
Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!
227
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,770
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
228
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,320
What’s wrong with you guys?
Why are you back, hey?!
229
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,480
More appeared!
230
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,730
The escape path was blocked!
231
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,900
It won’t do any good to multiply!
232
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,770
Hmm? What the--?!
233
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,530
Naruto Uzumaki…?
234
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,770
We leave the rest to you!
235
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,570
Whoa, let us in, quick!
236
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,770
Hey!
237
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,400
Entry has already…!
238
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,770
What kind…of entrance is
this kid making…?
239
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,070
Naruto.
240
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,780
He’s totally late.
241
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,940
What a drag.
242
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,770
Guys, run! A large herd of
stampeding bulls is coming.
243
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,650
Huh? What are you talking about?
244
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,530
Jeez! I’m serious.
So many of them…!
245
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,480
Huh? Hey… 					Where's Sasuke?
246
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,650
The Dosu guy I’m supposed
to fight isn’t here, either.
247
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,440
Hey, you guys there.
248
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,280
Don’t be restless.
249
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,820
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!
250
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,650
You guys are the stars of
this “final round.”
251
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,770
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
252
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,070
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
253
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,690
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
254
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,820
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
255
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,360
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
256
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,730
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
257
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,570
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
258
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,780
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
259
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,230
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
260
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,650
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
261
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,770
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
262
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:30,190
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
263
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,770
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
264
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:43,900
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
265
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,320
Hey Hinata!
266
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,280
Keep your eyes open and watch me
defeat this unpleasant guy!
267
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,400
He goes and decides that
a person's life path can't be changed…
268
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,780
Destiny is decided when one is born?
Don't kid me!
269
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,570
People definitely can change.
270
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,900
By defeating this guy,
I'll prove that!
271
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,570
Next time,
"Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone"
272
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,070
Quit gabbing
and let's get started!
//%
1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:09,870
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,120
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,410
One more time
4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,120
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,660
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,370
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,040
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:45,660
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:54,910
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:02,990
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,990
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,120
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,990
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,990
One more time
15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,290
The winner is Temari.
16
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,080
Oh, I’m tired…
17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,910
Oh, what a waste!
18
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,160
Why?! He had a chance to
become a Chunin!
19
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,910
Shikamaru is Shikamaru…
20
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,500
Really… Does he or doesn't he
have the motivation?
21
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,790
Even I’m not sure about it.
22
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,990
But his intelligence and strategies
are no longer at the Genin level.
23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,160
If it had been an actual mission
for a basic platoon,
24
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,580
the win was decided when
he captured Temari…
25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,410
So, I suppose he won the competition,
but he lost the match…
26
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,750
It’s unfortunate he shows no
signs of being motivated,
27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,330
on the other hand, he won’t get too
emotional or fall into a panic.
28
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,990
And that’s exactly why…
29
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,540
he’d be able to calmly pull back if
he viewed a situation as totally hopeless.
30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,620
That could be attributed to
calm judgment.
31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Shikamaru probably possesses…
32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,990
the most important psychological
element required for a Chunin…
33
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,330
the disposition of a leader!
34
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,910
In order to evaluate someone
as a leader of a platoon…
35
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,700
it’s much more important to
protect the platoon from danger,
36
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,580
than to carry out a mission.
37
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,040
Yeah…it’d hardly be worth mentioning
a completed mission
38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,750
if everyone was annihilated.
39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,410
The risks and the mission
should be put on a scale,
40
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,950
surviving should be thought of first,
and then action should be taken.
41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,990
A person who can’t do this isn’t
qualified to become a Chunin.
42
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,410
Hyuga and Naruto from earlier
fail on that point.
43
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,160
Although they are all right
as insignificant Genin.
44
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,120
Well, I do feel like Shikamaru
gave up too soon too.
45
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,870
What do you think?
46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,790
What do I feel…?
47
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,000
He has more of a chance
than Naruto, for sure!
48
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,080
Shoot…!
49
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,290
Why the heck did he give up!
50
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,750
Is he an idiot?!
51
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,750
This ticks me off!
52
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,870
I’m gonna really give him
a lecture!
53
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,410
So the one that’s gonna
become a Chunin is…
54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,160
You idiot!
55
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,540
Shut up, super idiot!
56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,580
Why the heck did you give up?!
57
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,990
Let’s not talk about that anymore,
all right?
58
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,990
It’s not all right! It was a match
you were close to winning!
59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,990
– Let's just watch the next match.
– But you just gave up! Unimaginable!
60
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,990
Simply unimaginable!
61
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,990
Huh? The next match?
62
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
Sasuke…!
63
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,790
"Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"
64
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,870
At last, Uchiha’s match is next.
65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh, but who’s this opponent Gaara?
66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,120
I wonder…
67
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,330
But compared to Uchiha,
he’s nothing much.
68
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,120
Do you know?
69
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,160
I hear Uchiha’s gonna
withdraw from this match.
70
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,540
Really?!
71
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,250
Yeah, he apparently sustained a serious
injury while training before the match…
72
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,990
Are you serious?
73
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,120
And to think I took time off
specifically to see this match!
74
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,540
I’m counting on you, come on!
75
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,620
As you’d expect, this match
will be won by Uchiha.
76
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,620
No way, I’ve got high hope
for the new one of the Sand.
77
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,250
He won’t let this one slip by.
78
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,080
As they say about the world
of competition…
79
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,990
It’s impossible to predict
what will occur…
80
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,990
Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,
81
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,370
he has not yet arrived at the arena.
82
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,080
Umm…it’s unavoidable…
83
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,750
We can’t make the guests
wait any longer.
84
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,620
Another ten minutes.
85
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,910
Why don’t we wait just
another ten minutes?
86
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,990
But…
87
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
The guests are looking forward
to the next match above all else.
88
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,990
Cancelling it would be cruel.
89
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,450
Since it’s come to this,
waiting another ten minutes wouldn’t hurt.
90
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,290
Lord Hokage…?
91
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,750
Umm…
92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Uchiha, where are you!
93
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,950
What's keeping you?
Hurry up!
94
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,330
There is some truth to what
Kazekage says.
95
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,990
So shall we extend it for
ten minutes from now.
96
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,080
So…let Genma know of this.
97
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,910
Yes!
98
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,950
If it stays like this, Uchiha will really
be forced to withdraw.
99
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,410
I see…a ten-minute extension…
100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Sasuke…
101
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,200
Hey, isn’t that…
102
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,000
Y-You are…
103
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,790
But, what’s that idiot doing!
He’s still not here?!
104
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,040
Sasuke…!
105
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,290
Please!
106
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,540
Good of the two of you to make it!
107
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,870
Come now, hurry into the arena!
108
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,990
Yeah!
109
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,990
All right! Here we go!
110
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,080
Oh! Yeah!
111
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,250
Most of the first round is finished,
112
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,450
and the only one left is
Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara.
113
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,750
H-How about Naruto and
Neji’s match…?!
114
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,290
Well, the interesting thing is…
115
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,990
That Hyuga lost…
116
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,750
Naruto beat Neji…
117
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,950
I see…
118
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,410
You did it!
119
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,990
Naruto!
120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,990
You’re such a…
good guy really…
121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,330
– What’s going on with the next match!
– Let's get on with it!
122
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,000
Isn’t Uchiha up yet?!
123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
We want Uchiha! Uchiha!
124
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,580
Uchiha!
125
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,620
Hey, it’s almost time.
126
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,990
Is he really gonna come?!
127
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,990
He’ll come…
128
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,990
He’ll definitely come!
129
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,700
Oh Sasuke, what’s he doing!
130
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,040
What the heck is Uchiha doing?!
131
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,660
It seems the rumor that
he’d had a serious injury was true.
132
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,500
If there’s a win by default,
then this match is mine.
133
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,990
Thirty more seconds…
134
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,450
Uchiha!
135
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,790
Uchiha!
136
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,580
Sasuke…please come!
137
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,870
Sasuke!
138
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,250
Hurry up and come!
139
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,990
It won’t be good if it stays this way!
140
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,950
The time limit is up.
141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,500
So this is it.
142
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,990
Because the time limit has expired,
the last match…
143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,080
See… Here he is…
144
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,200
Well, I’m sorry we’re late…
145
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,410
Sasu…
146
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,990
Your name?
147
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,040
Sasuke…Uchiha.
148
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,700
Sasuke…Uchiha.
149
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Sasuke!
150
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,410
It looks like he made it in time.
151
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,330
Lee!
152
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,410
Darn… Causing others
this much trouble…
153
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,500
and thinking himself so important!
154
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,330
Huh! You’re pretty late!
155
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,160
I thought you weren’t coming
‘cause you were scared to take me on!
156
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,330
Who the heck was it that
said he’d come for sure?
157
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,990
The first round…did you win?
158
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,250
Of course!
159
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,870
Don’t get too carried away…
160
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,330
Loser!
161
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,870
Well, I know it’s somewhat rude
to be showing up all flashy like this…
162
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,580
but was Sasuke…
163
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,750
disqualified?
164
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,450
So your habit of tardiness
rubbed off on him? Cripes…
165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,830
And…what about it?
166
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,700
It’s all right, Sasuke’s match
has been postponed anyway.
167
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,410
Your arrival was barely in time, but…
168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
he hasn’t been disqualified.
169
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,200
That’s good to hear!
170
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,120
Don’t lose to a guy like that!
171
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,830
Yeah…
172
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,580
I want to fight you too…
173
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,200
Sasuke!
174
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,450
I want…to fight you too!
175
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,410
Yeah…
176
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,290
Yay, Sasuke!
177
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,990
Uchiha's match is gonna start!
178
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,790
Shikamaru gave it so much,
but already it’s Sasuke…
179
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,870
Poor Shikamaru…
180
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,990
Hey, is that Uchiha?
181
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,120
I‘m just second fiddle…
182
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,040
Well, I guess that’s just
the way it goes…
183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,990
I’m looking forward to it too.
184
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,790
Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.
185
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
What is?
186
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,540
Well, Naruto did beat that
Neji Hyuga and…
187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,120
Sasuke is an elite member
of the Uchiha…
188
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,990
and it seems like everyone’s
anxious to see Sasuke’s match.
189
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,990
Sasuke will face that Gaara
of the Sand whom I couldn’t beat…
190
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,660
And Naruto beat that Neji
that I had hoped to take down.
191
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,750
Why is it so…
192
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,120
Why am I so…
193
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,500
frustrated!
194
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,750
Lee…!
195
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,790
At last…
196
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,040
Gaara, come down here!
197
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,950
Naruto! Let’s go up!
198
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,080
Yeah!
199
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,250
When we go up,
we’ll leisurely take the stairs.
200
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,830
What’s up with you!
201
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,000
Are you still upset that
I pushed you down?!
202
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
T-This isn’t good…
203
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,990
It’s been quite awhile
since I’ve seen Gaara like this.
204
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,500
H-Hey…Gaara.
205
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,700
Keep the strategy in mind--!
206
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,250
Don’t talk to Gaara right now!
207
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
You’ll be killed.
208
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,950
Right!
209
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,990
Let’s go!
210
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,990
Hey, hurry up!
211
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,250
Nothing good’s gonna happen
in your life if you panic.
212
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,250
What’s wrong?
213
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,540
Huh?
214
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,040
Low-level tournaments like this
Chunin Examination are ideal
215
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,540
as gambling matches.
216
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,500
A number of feudal lords
are here for that purpose.
217
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,830
So…would you lose this match for us.
218
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,250
Hey, come on,
at least give us an answer.
219
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,750
Too scared to say anything…
220
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,080
H-Help!
221
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,870
S-Stop! Stop!
222
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,830
If those two in front of us
hadn’t been there,
223
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,160
we probably would’ve been killed…
224
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,200
This is the first I’ve seen anyone
kill people without hesitation like that…
225
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200
This isn’t looking good
even for Sasuke.
226
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,990
Sasuke…
227
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,870
So now…at last…
228
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:29,990
Everyone makes mistakes
lt's nothing to be ashamed about
229
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:41,200
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
230
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:56,990
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
231
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,000
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
232
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,330
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
233
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,830
Let’s go carve the badges
in our chest
234
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,580
Yes, it’s Show Time,
life begins now.
235
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:22,870
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
236
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:33,540
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
237
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:44,080
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
238
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,870
Forge on strong
239
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,990
Darn it!
What kind of guy is that?!
240
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,990
Gaara is totally not normal!
He doesn't even look at us.
241
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,200
If anyone fights with him like that…
242
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,580
Darn! Hey Shikamaru!
We've got to go see Kakashi Sensei!
243
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,200
We've got to stop this fight,
no matter what!
244
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,200
Next time, "Bushy Brow's Jutsu:
Sasuke Style!"
245
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,870
If nothing's done,
Sasuke's a goner!
//%
1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,180
One more time
4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,840
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:45,430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,680
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,970
So what’s up, Temari?
16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,390
He’s close. He’s just right there.
17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,220
Dang it! What should we do?
18
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,640
Leave it to me.
19
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,970
That was close.
20
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,430
What was that noise?
21
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,840
An explosion…
Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.
22
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,970
I wonder if he’s okay.
23
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,840
Don’t worry…
He wouldn’t get bumped off so easily.
24
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,140
I sure hope so.
25
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,720
Now then, shall we get started?
26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,850
Before that, I must have you both
return to your original forms.
27
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,840
Please prepare yourself,
Sarutobi Sensei.
28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,600
An Unrivaled Match:
Hokage Battle Royale!
29
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,430
With every moment,
they are looking more lively…
30
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,100
What is that…Jutsu?
31
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,260
Reanimation.
32
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,600
It’s a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu
that can bring the dead back to this world.
33
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,470
The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu
is that it uses the blood of the caster.
34
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,390
But I’ve heard that with this Jutsu,
35
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,550
in order to summon
a dead soul to this world…
36
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,260
the body of a living person is sacrificed
as a container for the soul.
37
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,220
Then, the bodies of those two
are of the sacrificed…
38
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,800
Right…
39
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,430
Perhaps dust and dirt cover
the sacrificial body
40
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,720
and take on the original form
of the summoned soul.
41
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,550
And by way of the charm
embedded in the head,
42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,100
the personality of the soul is killed
43
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,050
and it morphs into no more
than a killing puppet.
44
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,640
They’re complete.
45
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,890
They look like how they used
to look more than ever.
46
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,050
Do you know the joy and sense
of accomplishment
47
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,350
of hurting one whom
you once called Sensei?
48
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,800
I prepared this scenario
so that you might know that joy.
49
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,390
So please enjoy it.
50
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,350
Lord Hokage!
51
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Even if the shape and form
are the same…
52
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,890
they’re neither the First Hokage
nor the Second!
53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,260
I…know!
54
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,140
Here I go!
55
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.
56
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
Water Style: Water Wall.
57
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,260
No way!
58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,300
To be able to set into motion that level
of Water Style in a place with no water.
59
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,350
I can’t believe it.
60
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,100
True to the title of the previous Hokage.
61
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,970
Water Style: Water Shock Wave!
62
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,600
Earth Style: Mud Wall.
63
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,100
Same mighty strength as always.
64
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,350
Having two of you is quite a challenge,
as might be expected…
65
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
This is bad.
66
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,840
This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.
67
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,930
Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:
68
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,840
Deep Forest Emergence.
69
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,640
His Chakra became a source for life.
70
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,800
Wow… So this is the legendary
Wood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage
71
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,600
who brought turbulent times under control
and built the Leaf Village.
72
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,840
You’re finally caught…eh, Sensei.
73
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,430
Okay. Everyone’s here, right?
74
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,140
Okay everyone, let’s evacuate quickly.
75
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,800
Don’t rush and don’t panic!
76
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,300
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
77
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,840
Does your stomach hurt or something?
78
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,180
No…it’s not that.
79
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,220
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu.
80
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,680
Appear!
81
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,550
Monkey King Enma.
82
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,840
Humph…
Something pesky has appeared, eh?
83
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,890
Old Monkey Enma.
84
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Orochimaru…
I knew this would happen.
85
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,840
You’re pathetic, Sarutobi…
lt’s because you didn’t kill him back then.
86
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,260
I’m going to do it now!
87
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,100
It’s too late.
88
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,180
Please…Enma!
The Adamantine Nyoi.
89
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,840
Take care of him.
Don’t let him transform into that!
90
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,180
Okay… Got it!
91
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,840
Transform!
92
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,970
All right.
93
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,680
Wow… What level of Ninjutsu battle!
94
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,100
This is Hokage level!
95
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,140
Oh well…
Things have finally gotten interesting.
96
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,840
That's one of his Snake Swords.
97
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,100
Let’s do it, Enma!
98
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,300
No matter how strong the body,
the Snake Sword still hurts.
99
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,300
You’re mine!
100
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,970
Lord Hokage!
101
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,720
So foolish…
102
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,390
To think you’d strike without even
using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
103
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
No, that’s not it.
104
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,640
It's not that he didn't use it.
He can’t use it.
105
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,180
The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage
has differs from the past.
106
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,260
The Shadow Clone Jutsu that
evenly disperses Chakra,
107
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,840
if things go wrong,
would be like throwing away Chakra.
108
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,850
Sure enough, is it age?!
109
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,470
Are you okay, Sensei?
110
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,930
Please hang in there.
111
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,680
You are called…
112
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,470
“the Professor who knows and uses all
of the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village,” right?
113
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,140
Please don’t disappoint me too much.
114
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,840
Please get up, Lord Hokage…!
115
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,720
And please save the Leaf Village!
116
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,350
Lord Hokage!
117
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,260
Fool… It is too late.
118
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Sarutobi, what’s wrong?
119
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,180
You’re not your usual self.
120
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,100
It’s as if you’re good for nothing…
What are you hesitating for?
121
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,680
Now’s the time to draw the line.
122
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,100
Orochimaru…
123
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,840
You…fool!
124
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,840
Orochimaru…
125
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,430
This is the end.
126
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,510
I’ll snap your neck.
127
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,680
As I thought…
128
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,300
It looks like there’s no point if
I don’t do something about the soul itself
129
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,800
that is bound by the Reanimation.
130
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,840
If so, all I can do is to use…
the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.
131
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,350
Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage,
please forgive me for using that Jutsu!
132
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,430
Sensei…it seems you’re out of breath.
133
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,840
You’ve gotten old, haven’t you?
134
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,180
I’ve never seen such a pained look.
135
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,800
What’s so funny?
136
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,840
It’s quite sad…
137
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,510
Old age beats even you,
once renowned as the god of Shinobi.
138
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,010
What’s that…?!
What the heck is going on?
139
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,390
Who the heck is that youth?
140
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,680
Who the heck are you?!
141
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,050
Is it so sudden you can’t tell?
142
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,550
It’s me. Orochimaru.
143
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,890
It can’t be…
144
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,260
Have you completed that
Forbidden Jutsu?!
145
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,350
You’re a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!
146
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,840
I finally caught up.
147
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
This is as far as you guys go.
148
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,100
Dang it!
149
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Sasuke Uchiha.
150
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,140
I won’t let you get away now.
151
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:27,970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
152
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:39,300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
153
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
154
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
155
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
156
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
157
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
158
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:31,640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
159
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:42,180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
160
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,840
Forge on strong
161
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,890
Orochimaru…
162
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,390
a genius Ninja who appeared
during the war-torn era
163
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,390
and one of a kind in decades.
164
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,180
I wanted to believe that this individual
would succeed my strength and will.
165
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,680
But my naiveté created this situation.
166
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,840
I will bury you now and
correct my old mistake.
167
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,890
Next time, “A Mistake from the Past:
A Face Revealed!”
//%
1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,680
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,100
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,760
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,260
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,890
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,350
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,180
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,930
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,470
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,590
Shikamaru! Ino! Choji!
21
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,590
Heh… Well…
22
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,430
It’s a drag,
but it’s Lady Tsunade’s orders.
23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,930
Old Lady Tsunade’s…?
24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,590
You’re pursuing Mizuki, right?
25
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,590
Y-Yeah…!
26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,430
And…who are these guys here?
27
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,800
Fujin and Raijin.
28
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,590
Fujin…and Raijin?
29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,430
Yeah. They’re a little weak upstairs,
but their brute strength…
30
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,590
is Herculean, surpassing even that
of the Legendary Sannin.
31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,590
Are you serious?
32
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,590
Damn… It looks like he really means it.
33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,590
Pretty amazing that they are able
to hold out
34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,050
against the Shadow Possession Jutsu
only by using their strength…
35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,550
It looks like this is gonna turn
into a troublesome situation again…
36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,140
Leave this to us…
You go pursue Mizuki!
37
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,590
We’ll be fine!
38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,470
Leave it to us!
39
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,220
Awright!
40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,590
But be careful!
41
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,590
Those guys are crazy like monsters!
42
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,590
Yeah… I can see that.
43
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,140
Go, Naruto!
44
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,300
Thanks, guys!
45
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,590
We better hurry, Naruto!
46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,140
Your opponents are this way!
47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,600
You guys… Doing this kind of thing
to us brothers!
48
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,140
Don’t even think we’re gonna
let you leave here alive!
49
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,800
Well… I wouldn’t be
so sure about that.
50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,590
Choji! Ino! Let’s hurry and
take care of these guys!
51
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,800
– Okay! 					– Okay!
52
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,590
A New Formation:
Ino-Shika-Cho!
53
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,260
Wait, Mizuki!
54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,590
Looks like I’m gonna
have a little fun, Iruka!
55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,640
This way?
56
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,590
Mizuki! Where are you?
57
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,590
D-Damn!
58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,430
This is Genjutsu…
59
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,140
Release!
60
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,970
After Genjutsu…
Puppets come, huh?
61
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,930
His Jutsu are diverse.
62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
And moreover, the timing of
his Jutsu are superb…
63
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,300
I was really close to
being taken down…
64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,680
I wouldn’t have imagined that
65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,930
he could have such full command
of the high level Jutsu…that Mizuki.
66
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,890
I guess I can praise you on catching that
the Puppet was real.
67
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,590
However… I wonder how long
68
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,590
you’re gonna be able to continue
to engage in my game, Iruka!
69
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,300
Where’s this…?!
70
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,800
This ain’t good…
71
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,140
They’re able to repel
Shadow Possession Jutsu
72
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,850
using only their strength…
73
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,260
Shikamaru, I’ll go!
74
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,350
Choji!
75
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,100
Stop it! Their strength is unearthly!
76
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,180
I’ll hold this guy down…
77
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,260
While I do that take care
of the other one!
78
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,300
Okay! All right, let’s go, Ino!
79
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,680
Leave it to me!
80
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,550
Ninja Art: Mind Transfer Jutsu!
81
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,350
What’s the matter, Elder Brother?
82
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,140
A success!
83
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,590
Oops…
84
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,100
All right!
85
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,930
Formation, Ino-Shika-Cho
completed!
86
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,720
Elder Brother!
What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
87
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,930
Iruka Sensei…
I’ll catch up with you in no time…
88
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,890
Please be safe!
89
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,800
How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?
90
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,600
Pretty good for being self-taught,
wouldn’t you say?
91
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,590
I can’t understand…
92
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,140
You have the ability to use
such high-level Ninjutsu to this degree…
93
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,590
why would you waste it?!
94
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,550
As always, trying to impose
your morals on me, huh…?!
95
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,590
You’re so lukewarm!
You’re so naïve!
96
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,890
Don’t you start preaching me!
97
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,050
I won’t acknowledge you,
no matter what!
98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,850
I consistently hardened my heart
and carried out my missions…
99
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,600
Despite that, those guys in the village…
100
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,590
No matter how strong I was!
101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,180
No matter how many enemies
I took down in my missions!
102
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,590
Those guys didn’t even attempt
to acknowledge me!
103
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,180
Saying we’re comrades,
it’s all about teamwork…
104
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,180
They were all bound
by stupid rules!
105
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,970
His target’s the Secret Manuscript.
106
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,590
Backup Mizuki!
107
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,590
Right!
108
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,300
Hey! Are you all right?!
109
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,140
I-I can’t feel my leg…
110
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,800
What do you think, Mizuki?
111
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,760
It’s no good.
lt’s unfortunate, but he can no longer…
112
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,640
I see…
113
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,850
All right! Let’s withdraw!
114
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,140
Hurry!
115
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,050
Yeah…
116
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,760
It’s unfortunate, but…
117
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,140
Guys who are of no use
on the battleground
118
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,050
only become a ball and chain…
119
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,220
Even though it’s just a minor injury,
120
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,220
you won’t be able to move
from this place…
121
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,590
If you’re wanna blame someone,
122
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,100
I suggest you blame
your own helpless self!
123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,590
I simply carried out
my mission faithfully.
124
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,010
And despite that, those guys
in the village…
125
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,390
Not one of them even attempted
to acknowledge me…
126
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,180
Why?! Why didn’t anybody
acknowledge my strength?!
127
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,720
Why?! Iruka…!
128
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,260
When you and even that Nine-Tailed brat
are acknowledged, why only me…?
129
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,140
It’s still not too late.
130
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,260
If you pay for your crimes
and start afresh,
131
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,890
the people in the village will certainly…
132
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,430
How cocky! Don’t preach to me!
133
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,300
You’re just the same as
those other guys in the village!
134
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,510
You disdain me, don’t you?!
135
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,050
Mizuki…
136
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,180
Everything…
137
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,890
That’s right…
Everything began that day…
138
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,010
What are you gonna do,
getting nervous now?
139
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,590
Mizuki…
140
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,180
It finally takes place tomorrow,
doesn’t it?
141
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,590
The Academy’s teacher
recruitment exam…
142
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,430
Yeah… It’s weighing heavily on me.
143
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,890
I’m envious of you.
Your scores are better than mine.
144
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,220
You’ll breeze right through
tomorrow’s exam.
145
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,140
Not quite… Well, in any case,
let’s both do our best!
146
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,600
Yeah!
147
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,180
Damn!
148
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,970
Lie low!
149
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,590
That was close, Iruka!
150
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,590
Yeah…
151
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,640
Mizuki… Thank you.
You really helped me out!
152
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,800
It’s mutual…
Come on, let’s hurry!
153
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:43,600
Ninja Academy 					Exam Results
154
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,550
Number 7 - Iruka Umino
155
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,470
I-I did it…
156
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,600
I did it!
157
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,350
Mizuki…
158
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,260
Exam Office
159
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,760
Now then, regarding Mizuki…
we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
160
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,590
Yes, it can’t be helped.
161
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,300
I agree…
The questions that were raised
162
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,010
at the time of that mission to
recover the Secret Manuscript…
163
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,430
Until those are completely cleared up…
lt can’t be helped, can it?
164
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,590
According to the autopsy report…
165
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,470
the cause of death to that corpse
was given as suffocation.
166
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,590
In Mizuki and the others’ reports,
167
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,760
it stated that the leg injury
was not that serious…
168
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
I understand…
169
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,800
He’s brilliant but it can’t be helped.
170
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,590
I was just carrying out the mission
that I was assigned to do!
171
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,470
Can you understand how miserable
the life I've led has been since then?!
172
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,350
Huh? Iruka?!
173
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,680
You have no idea, do you?
174
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,590
I have undergone
so many hardships,
175
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,590
and you, who has had it so easy…
176
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,590
Which one of us is the true Shinobi…
177
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,850
Let’s clarify that once and for all,
shall we?!
178
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,050
Now then come! Iruka!
179
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,890
Mizuki… Where are you?!
180
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,430
You don’t have any intention
of reforming yourself, do you?!
181
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,590
Don’t make me say the same thing
over and over again!
182
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,220
Then I’ll bring this to an end now…
183
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,100
It’s very unfortunate, though!
184
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,590
What a tearjerker…
185
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,760
It makes me happy too, Iruka…
186
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,720
Elder Brother?!
What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
187
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,180
Hey… You came back, Elder Brother!
188
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,640
Uh, Elder Brother?
189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,800
What did you guys do to…
to Elder Brother?!
190
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,590
I hijacked him! Idiot!
191
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,300
Wh-What the heck…?!
192
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,510
What?!
193
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,300
Elder Brother! Get up! Wake up!
194
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
These guys!
195
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,760
Owww…!
196
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,590
Are you okay, Ino?
197
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,970
I-I think I’m…
198
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,930
not okay! My gorgeous face is…!
199
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,590
Good grief… Gimme a break…
200
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,970
C-Choji!
201
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,140
Choji!
202
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,590
Are you okay?!
203
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,590
I-I’m fine…
204
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,350
Sorry… Feels like I fell asleep a little.
205
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,550
Hey, Elder Brother… You woke up.
206
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Damn. Can’t be helped…
207
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Guess I have no choice but to use
that thing.
208
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,720
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
209
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
Elder Brother…!
210
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,100
H-How dare you!
211
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,300
We’re close. Mizuki may have
set a trap so be careful!
212
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,930
I know that!
213
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,970
It was so much fun to be behind bars…
214
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,100
The moldiness… The dampness…
The gloominess…
215
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,590
Pitch black year round!
216
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,350
But for that very reason that
I was able master techniques
217
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,600
that an ordinary Shinobi would
not be able to possess…
218
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,590
Even in this darkness…
219
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,760
I can get an intense sense
of your energy…
220
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,590
What’s the matter?
Are you done already?
221
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,590
There’s no time to be spaced out, Iruka.
222
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,300
I’m gonna take my time
and have fun with this…
223
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,680
Take my time, got it?
224
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,470
All right! Me too!
225
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,430
Wait! If you go in there right now
using Mind Transfer Jutsu,
226
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,590
my Jutsu will affect you too!
227
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,590
If you think you’re the only one
who’s learned a new Jutsu,
228
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,050
you’re very wrong!
229
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,100
Ninja Art:
230
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,140
Mind Destruction Jutsu!
231
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
Wh-What’s the matter, Raijin?!
232
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,590
R-Raijin… What are you doing?!
233
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
Heh… Not bad…
234
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,760
“Ino collection,”
my new spring season Jutsu!
235
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,350
We’re close!
236
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,300
That’s it! That building!
237
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,680
All right! Just one last spurt!
238
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,640
How about it?
Have your eyes adjusted a little?
239
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,100
For guys like you who have lived
their lives in the light,
240
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,350
darkness is an inconvenience, isn’t it?
241
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,010
Damn! Where are you?!
242
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,260
Hey, Iruka, weren’t you saying that
243
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
you were going to bring this
to an end ?
244
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,300
I see! By end,
245
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,600
you must have been
talking about yourself, huh?!
246
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,590
Heh! Just a little bit!
247
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,430
Hang in there, Ino!
248
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,510
Leave it to me!
249
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,590
Damn…!
250
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,010
Damn! Unbelievable idiot strength!
251
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,260
Th-Those jerks…
252
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,590
I-I can’t hold them any longer!
253
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,510
If we put a stop to the Jutsu right now,
everything will go to waste…
254
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,970
Think… Think about the next move…
255
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,470
Bear with it, Ino!
256
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,590
Leave it to me!
257
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,930
You’re just gonna be
sent flying again!
258
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,430
Ino, just be quiet and watch!
259
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,050
Even the big-boned guy can make
quite a showing once he decides to do it!
260
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,430
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
261
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,140
Both Hands!
262
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,430
Choji…
263
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,550
I can’t let just Ino get
all the good parts!
264
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,510
I’m the number one handsome
Big-Boned Ninja!
265
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,050
Good work, Choji! You’re so cool!
266
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,590
Huh… That Choji…
267
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,590
New Formation!
lno-Shika-Cho completed!
268
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,760
It’s strange…
269
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,010
Any hint of Mizuki in the air
has vanished…
270
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,590
It’s too quiet…
271
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,100
That’s not it…
272
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,550
Even deeper…
273
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,300
Footsteps? No… It’s not …
274
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,600
It’s different from the sound
of footsteps…
275
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,590
Finer and smaller…
276
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,180
Continuous…
277
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,050
sound.
278
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,430
Paper Bombs?!
279
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,590
Wh-What is that…?!
280
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,590
Wh-What happened here?!
281
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,590
Iruka Sensei?!
282
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,890
Iruka Sensei!
283
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,510
Crappy news pass us by
284
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,850
And you become speechless
285
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,850
My voice is way too soft
286
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,140
So you don’t answer
287
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,760
You’re crying   Crying alone
288
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,600
What can I do?   I’m crying too
289
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,220
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
290
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:07,550
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
291
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:17,050
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
292
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:26,260
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
293
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:38,010
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
294
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,590
No way! What happened to
lruka Sensei?!
295
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,760
The scent ends here.
296
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,260
In any case,
we just have to search the perimeter.
297
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,550
Everything is in pieces. Damn it!
298
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,140
Please be safe, Iruka Sensei!
299
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,140
Hush! Be quiet, Naruto!
300
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,970
We have a company.
301
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,180
It seems someone is after us.
302
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,050
Next episode: “Orochimaru’s Shadow!”
//%
1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,680
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,100
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,760
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,260
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,890
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,350
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,180
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,930
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,470
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,430
Sakura's Determination
21
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,600
Where’s Sasuke!
Where did you put him?!
22
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,390
Heh! You’re Naruto, right?
23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,600
You wouldn’t believe anything
I said anyway, would you…?
24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,590
That’s right! I won’t believe
that Sasuke’s dead!
25
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,010
Naruto…
26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,470
That’s right. Sasuke is alive.
27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,590
I’ll bring Sasuke back!
28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,720
I made that promise!
29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,100
Naruto…
30
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,180
In that case, take me down!
31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,350
If I were the wimp I was in the past,
32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,800
I would probably have
told you the truth.
33
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,050
Arashi!
34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,970
No! The old Arashi is dead!
35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,590
The person you see here
is just a block of flesh
36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,890
kept alive by
Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!
37
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,220
Sakura, please look after Sasame!
38
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,590
Stop it, Naruto! Don’t fight with Arashi!
39
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,390
No!
40
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,680
This guy isn’t the same gentle Arashi
you once knew, Sasame!
41
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,550
Jigumo! Go!
42
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,800
No!
43
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,050
Sasame! I'm sorry!
44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,350
Over here!
45
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,050
Naruto!
46
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
Don’t, Sakura!
47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,930
Kamikiri…!
48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,970
Finish him!
49
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,510
Naruto!
50
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,590
You’re…next…!
51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Sakura!
52
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,890
That was close…
53
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,850
I almost let my guard down.
54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,260
Just when you had a chance
to launch a sneak attack.
55
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,600
You blew it, didn’t you, Naruto?
56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
Naruto!
57
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,180
All because of that ball and chain…!
58
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,590
Ball and chain…?!
59
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,590
Naruto… I'm sorry!
60
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,050
That’s not true at all!
61
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,350
This kind of injury…
62
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,010
is nothing…at all!
63
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,180
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
64
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,470
If there’s three on your side,
65
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,220
I'll go with five on mine!
66
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,890
Kamikiri!
67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,800
Naruto!
68
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,260
Are you all right?!
69
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,600
You’re badly hurt…
70
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,850
Sakura… This injury is nothing!
71
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,100
“Sakura…This injury is nothing!”
72
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,800
Stop it! If you say more than that…!
73
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,600
I won’t say more! I’ll bring this to an end.
74
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,680
Kamikiri! Jigumo!
75
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Give me your Chakra…
76
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,760
Boar, Dog, Rat,
Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,
77
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,390
Dog, Monkey, Dragon,
Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon…
78
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,470
Why does Arashi know that technique?
79
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,720
It’s a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefs
of the Fuma clan could use…
80
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,300
What was that?!
81
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,970
Fuma Ninja Art:
82
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,180
Spell of the Mandala!
83
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,590
This ain’t good!
84
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Naruto!
85
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,140
What the heck is this?!
86
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,220
This is the end!
87
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,590
What?!
88
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
Naruto!
89
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,300
The Chakra cage gradually shrinks…
90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,720
And the human enclosed therein
is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.
91
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,800
You can’t break it.
92
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,850
As long as I myself do not
dissolve the Jutsu.
93
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,720
Naruto!
94
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,590
I’m incapable of doing anything…
95
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,640
There’s nothing I’m capable of doing…
96
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,590
The person I am now isn’t…
97
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,430
capable of doing anything!
98
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,300
Arashi!
99
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,590
Sasame…
100
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,720
You!
101
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,800
Sasame!
102
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Please…come to your senses…
103
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,930
Become the old Arashi again!
104
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,720
I told you, already!
105
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,930
The old Arashi is dead.
106
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,590
Arashi…
107
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,600
I’m sorry, Sasame…
108
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,430
I wanted power…
109
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,470
I wanted the Fuma Clan to find
a place in the sun once again…
110
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,640
Yes! I understand that!
I understand that!
111
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,590
But, enough now…
Let’s go home.
112
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,010
Let’s go back to the village.
113
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,350
But, I’m just a mere monster now…
114
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,550
That’s not true!
115
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,600
This is agony…
116
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,970
Sassme…
117
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,590
Please… kill me…
118
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,220
Please…kill…
119
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,590
How dare you try to kill me!
120
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,590
Arashi!
121
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,590
You’ll…die!
122
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,590
Sakura!
123
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,590
Sakura?!
124
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,510
You wanna be… the first to die?
125
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,970
Sasame taught me that…
126
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,300
dying isn’t anything to be scared of!
127
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,850
I see…
128
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,720
But what’s scary is to live one’s life
without having been able to do anything…
129
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,260
I’m not afraid to die in the service
of someone who is important to me!
130
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,760
Don’t!
131
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,600
I’m telling you…
132
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,930
Whatever happens, you mustn’t die…
No matter what! Sakura!
133
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,680
Naruto!
134
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,850
Give it up!
135
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,590
What is it you think you’re capable
of doing the way you are now?!
136
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,300
That’s so useless!
137
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,220
Vanish from this world
get crushed into nothing…!
138
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,510
Sasame!
139
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,010
Stop that, Arashi!
140
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,590
Sasame…you!
141
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,930
Naruto!
142
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,590
Hey! Let go!
143
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,140
No!
144
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,970
Arashi?!
145
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,550
I’m sorry, Sasame…
146
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,800
I caused you so much hardship…
147
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,590
No, you haven’t!
148
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,850
The person who experienced
the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!
149
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,390
Is there anything I can do for you?
150
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,590
What should I do for you?!
151
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,680
You’ve already helped me
more than enough…
152
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,680
See… Thanks to you, Sasame,
153
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,890
I was able to return to being
the person I was in the past…
154
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,550
Naruto!
155
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,300
Sakura…
156
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,350
Even if it’s to be of service
to someone…
157
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,180
There’s no life that
should be lost for that!
158
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,590
Yeah!
159
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,050
Run! Sakura!
160
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,590
Pervy Sage!
161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,100
Sorry to be late!
162
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,140
I was faced with a number of obstacles
on my end too!
163
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,590
Gimme a break…
164
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,140
Now then…
Climb on, climb on!
165
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,260
Hurry! Let’s get back above ground!
166
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,590
Oops!
167
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,050
Sasame!
168
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,300
She’s fine… She just fainted.
169
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,470
Naruto!
170
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,890
Orochimaru assigned us a mission…
171
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,590
To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back
172
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,970
to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves under any circumstances!
173
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,590
Then, Sasuke is…?!
174
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,430
Yeah… He’s alive!
175
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,590
Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke
176
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,180
because he is his vital vessel which
he will possess in three years!
177
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Arashi…
178
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,720
Arashi… This place is gonna collapse!
179
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,930
Hurry up and come over here!
180
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,140
I’m already just a puppet…
181
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,590
I cannot live my life anywhere
except here.
182
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,590
Arashi…
183
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,930
All right!
184
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,590
No! Arashi!
185
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,300
Sasame…
186
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,260
Thank you.
187
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,590
Including Arashi,
we’ve paid an extraordinary price but…
188
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,430
The Fuma Clan has been
able to cut itself free
189
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,300
from Orochimaru’s spell…
190
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,300
You can start again anew.
191
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,590
I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!
192
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,930
With this life…
that Arashi protected.
193
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,590
Yeah!
194
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,850
I am truly indebted to you.
195
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,720
Sasame…
196
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,680
Hanzaki, I’m leaving these two
in your hands!
197
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,220
Yes, sir!
Please take care along the road!
198
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,590
I will.
199
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,180
– Thank you!
– We thank you!
200
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,050
– Take care!
– See you again!
201
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,510
Hey! Hang in there!
202
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,600
Well, we weren’t able
to find Sasuke,
203
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,300
but at least we now know
that he’s alive somewhere…
204
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,430
We’ll have to settle for the fact
that we were able to ascertain
205
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,850
the new information that we still have
a grace period of three years
206
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,890
before he becomes a vessel
to be possessed by Orochimaru.
207
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,010
Yes…
208
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,350
Sasame knew what she needed
to do for her clan…
209
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,890
But this time again all I did was cry.
210
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,550
All I did was depend on Naruto…
211
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,590
Sakura!
212
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,470
You gave your best effort too!
213
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,180
No, I was just a ball and chain
to everyone…
214
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,510
I wasn’t capable of doing
anything alone…
215
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,930
That’s not true!
216
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,470
Seeing you give your best effort
like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.
217
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,590
If you hadn’t been there, Sakura,
I’d have been crushed just like that.
218
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,680
It’s thanks to you, Sakura!
219
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,140
Naruto…
220
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,470
Wow, you’ve grown into someone
who can say that sort of thing!
221
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,680
Oww! I’m an injured man!
Treat me with a little more care!
222
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,590
Oh yeah, that’s right!
223
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,590
All I was thinking about at that time
was protecting someone I cared about…
224
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,470
What I’m capable of
doing right now…
225
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,550
I was thinking…
226
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,590
What?
227
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,100
There are many variables such
as mission level,
228
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,100
or platoon’s member structure…
229
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,600
But no matter how small
a platoon might be,
230
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,300
I think it’s important to assign
one Medical Ninja to it…
231
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,550
I know that already…
232
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,430
I wrote exactly the same thing
in a report long ago
233
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,760
regarding the survival rate and mission
achievement rate of small platoons.
234
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,760
But it’s not that easy to
nurture Medical Ninja.
235
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,970
They require a different set of skills
than that of fighting types Ninja…
236
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,590
The minute perfection
of Chakra control,
237
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,600
the ability to assimilate a huge volume
of specialized knowledge,
238
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,010
the brains to apply that in a broad way…
patience…
239
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,590
And there is the most important thing
240
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,180
for Shinobi who are to develop
into a Medical Ninja…
241
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
Well, I’m busy right now, so…
242
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,510
The most important thing…huh?
243
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,050
Hidden Leaf Hospital
I’m all wrapped up in bandages again…
244
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,350
This way I can’t even
hold chopsticks…
245
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,590
Sakura, when it’s time for
my meal, feed me, okay?
246
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,390
I’ll open up my mouth just like this and…
247
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Huh? Sakura?
248
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,350
I’m sorry! I was just joking!
249
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,390
I’m sorry… Naruto…
250
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,600
Huh?
251
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,550
This is gonna mean that
I’ll keep you waiting a little but…
252
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,590
Next time, I definitely won’t…
253
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
be a ball-and-chain to you!
254
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,970
Huh?
255
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,590
Enter!
256
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,300
I came here with a request!
257
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,010
What is it?
258
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,590
Please make me your apprentice!
259
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,590
You’re very desperate, aren’t you?
260
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,350
Sakura Haruno,
261
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,180
I heard from Kakashi that you have
a brilliant mind as well as will power!
262
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,970
All right.
263
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,680
But in exchange,
I’m not gonna be easy on you!
264
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,430
Yes, ma’am!
265
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,600
This recent mission…
266
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,640
looks like it wasn’t wasted
on her, after all.
267
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,930
When I recalled the parts one by one,
268
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,390
I felt as though
I had understood everything
269
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:45,850
Faded words which I kept so close to me
270
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:55,590
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
271
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,550
and this distant yearning for you
272
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:11,680
I live, simply repeating this cycle
273
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:23,550
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
274
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:33,850
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
275
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,590
I’ll keep these thoughts…
276
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,850
He makes me so angry,
that Pervy Sage!
277
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,100
Didn’t he say “I’ll make you
my disciple and hone your skills”?!
278
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,140
When Sakura’s already become
the Old Lady Tsunade's
279
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,590
and is working so hard!
280
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,590
And he just leaves me to
my own devices! Hey!
281
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,180
All because he was assigned
a mission by Old Lady Tsunade!
282
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,510
If things come to this,
283
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,470
I’m gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade
a piece of my mind!
284
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,220
Next episode, “The Three Villains
from the Maximum Security Prison”
//%
1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,190
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,090
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,200
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,960
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,140
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,170
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,450
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,020
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,410
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,210
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,380
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,720
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,550
What?!
20
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,020
O-Oh!
21
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,560
T-That’s…
22
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,260
It's the empty shell of sand!
23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,470
Lee's Hidden Strength:
Forbidden Secret Jutsu!
24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,170
When did that…?!
25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,540
That’s not possible!
26
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,840
While you had your eyes closed
and were praying.
27
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,610
What?
28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,710
For a moment, Lee stopped moving
because of the pain in his body.
29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,220
At that moment…that’s when!
30
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,930
Gaara!
31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,550
That's...!
32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,010
There’s no doubt about it – his eyes…
33
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,720
He’s completely awake…
34
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,090
The demon…inside him.
35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,450
Run away!
36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,560
That Bowl-Cut’s totally worn down…
37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,400
Gaara is toying with him.
38
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,000
W-Why doesn’t Lee dodge?
39
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,470
With Lee’s speed, he should easily be
able to dodge that level of attack.
40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,650
It’s not that he doesn’t dodge,
it’s that he can’t dodge.
41
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,550
What?!
42
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,650
What do you mean?
43
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,190
The Lotus is a double-edged sword.
44
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,920
What do you mean double-edged sword?
45
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,330
Why do you think the Lotus is
a forbidden technique?
46
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,830
Well…
47
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,100
The Lotus isn’t a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu.
48
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,430
It’s a Taijutsu, with that much
high-speed movement.
49
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,500
The load it puts on a person’s body
is beyond imagination.
50
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,840
So Lee’s entire body is in
so much pain right now
51
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,340
that even moving is out of the question.
52
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,210
Isn’t that so…
53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,510
Guy?
54
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,750
But that’s…!
55
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,210
He has no Ninjutsu, not even
one Genjutsu …
56
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,850
Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on,
57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,220
it’s now even less than
an average person’s …
58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,550
There’s no way he can win!
59
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,860
He’s had it if this goes on…
60
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,930
Lee…
61
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,540
Hey, get a move on all of you.
62
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,610
I’ll add another 200 laps!
63
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,340
Stupid! There’s no way
you’ll become a Ninja.
64
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,550
Yes, I will.
65
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,650
There’s no way a chump who can’t
even use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja!
66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,550
Yes, I will!
67
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,550
Whatever, but the fact that a guy like
you without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu
68
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,420
and with less Taijutsu than
an average person
69
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,760
is in this Ninja academy is nonsense.
70
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,800
Do you know what you’re called here?
71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,430
Hot-Blooded!
72
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,900
Hot-Blooded!
73
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,670
Hot-Blooded lose-
74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,540
Hey, get in line, Lee!
75
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,710
Hey Lee!
76
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,110
So that’s the hot-blooded loser
everyone’s talking about.
77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,910
Doesn’t he look like
someone we know?
78
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:10,750
Huh?
79
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,520
In particular…his eyebrows.
80
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,550
Hmm…
81
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,020
Rock Lee…
82
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,560
The chump who can only perform
less than average Taijutsu…
83
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,230
But you...
84
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,770
You practiced your less
than average Taijutsu …
85
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,340
You practiced it over and
over again like crazy…
86
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,680
396…397…398…399…
87
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,650
400…401…402…403…
88
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,550
If I can’t do a log kick 500 times,
then it’s 1,000 squats!
89
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,560
413... 414...
90
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,560
415... 416... 417... 418...!
91
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,430
419... 420…
92
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,630
So someone’s here before me…
93
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,540
422… 423... 424...
94
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,540
425... 426...
95
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,710
I suppose I’ll come back…
96
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,320
If I can’t do 1,000 squats,
then it’s 2,000 punches!
97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,560
795… 796… 797… 798…
98
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
He’s still at it…!
99
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,640
2,000 punches!
100
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,540
If I can’t, it’s 2,000 jump ropes!
101
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,520
You recklessly practiced only
Taijutsu and eventually…
102
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,320
All right, you’ve all become
Genin as of today,
103
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,960
so I’d like to know what
it is you’re all aiming for!
104
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
105
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,470
Tenten.
106
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,670
I’d like to become a powerful Ninja
like the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!
107
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,770
Hmm...
108
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,980
And, how about you, Neji?
109
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,880
I don’t want to answer…
110
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,420
I…!
111
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,690
I’d like to prove that I could
become a respectable Ninja
112
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,190
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
113
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,960
That would be the ultimate for me!
114
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Those are good serious eyes…
115
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,000
Humph!
116
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,100
You!
117
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,160
What’s so funny?!
118
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,470
I’m serious!
119
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,540
I will become a respectable Ninja
even only with Taijutsu!
120
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,110
He should give up already…
121
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,940
At this rate…
122
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,110
He will simply die with Gaara
just toying with him…
123
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,550
Bushy Brows…!
124
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,720
Lee…
125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,440
Not yet… Not yet!
126
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,710
Lee, you just won’t learn
your lesson, will you?
127
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,550
There’s no way you can win…
128
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,350
Unlike you, Neji is a genius.
129
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,550
A genius…?
130
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,390
What is a genius?!
131
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,560
Even though I may not have talent,
I’ll exceed genius with my efforts.
132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,130
That is my entire being!
133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,430
That is my Way of the Ninja!
134
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,230
You’ll get nowhere, Lee…
135
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,540
No matter how much effort you make,
136
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,800
there’s no way you can take me down.
137
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,570
That’s simply a fact.
138
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,880
That's not true!
139
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,340
That’s not…
140
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,560
But you…refused to give up, not ever!
141
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,760
Such meaningless actions…
142
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,570
The Bowl-Cut was unlucky to
have Gaara as his opponent!
143
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,670
No…
144
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,640
Lee’s not one to give up
with this much.
145
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,540
– What? 					– Huh?
146
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,940
The reason is that Lee…
147
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,490
The reason is that Lee…
148
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,550
You…continued to make effort.
149
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,500
If I can’t jump rope 1,200 times,
I’ll log kick 2,000 times!
150
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,160
1,116... 1,117...!
151
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,430
1,118... 1,11--!
152
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,270
Huh?!
153
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,150
Lee!
154
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,990
Are you taking a break already?
155
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,500
Guy Sensei…
156
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,470
What is it that you want?
157
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,300
If it’s about my blunder with
the recent assignment,
158
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,540
I believe I’ve apologized.
159
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,210
Lee… It’s true you’re different from Neji.
160
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,310
You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills,
and you’re not a Taijutsu genius either…
161
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
But Lee...
162
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,150
you have powers
that exceed Neji…
163
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,660
you’re a genius with hidden potential.
164
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,930
If you’re trying to make me feel better,
please stop!
165
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,130
Idiot!
166
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,430
I’m not trying to make you feel better
or anything!
167
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,570
The reason is that you are…
168
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,540
a genius of effort!
169
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,710
I wonder if…
170
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,050
If that’s true…?
171
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,150
I've…I’ve believed that to be true…
172
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,020
That if I trained harder than Neji…
2 or 3 times as much…
173
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,030
that I’d surely become stronger.
174
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:03,930
But...
175
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,870
I’ve recently begun to think that…
176
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,540
I can’t beat a real genius.
177
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,510
Is effort really rewarded…?
178
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,540
I’ve wanted to know this and
179
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,280
so I’ve taken on Neji,
but it’s always been the same…!
180
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,550
I’m no match for him at all!
181
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,020
Even when I’m on a mission…
182
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,550
My legs still tremble even now…
183
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,390
I think that I’ll never become
stronger though I strive and strive…
184
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,400
I am so afraid that I can’t bear it!
185
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,570
What am I to do…?
186
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,910
There’s no point in making the effort
if you don’t believe in yourself!
187
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,550
Lee, you’re very similar to me.
188
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,050
Do you mean our eyebrows?
189
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,390
No, not just our eyebrows…
190
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,560
I was actually a failure once too…
191
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,560
You were, Sensei?
192
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,560
But now, I can even win against
the genius elite Kakashi,
193
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,470
because of my efforts…
194
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,540
“I’d like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja
195
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,140
even though I can’t use Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu” you said.
196
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,210
That’s your Ninja way, right?
197
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,250
That’s a fine goal…
198
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,150
It’s a fine goal worth sticking to!
199
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,420
That’s why you should believe in
your path and forge straight ahead!
200
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,200
Become a man powerful enough
so that I can just watch you smiling!
201
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,770
Understand, Lee?!
202
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,370
Yes!
203
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,850
Thank you…Guy Sensei…!
204
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Stop, Lee!
205
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,230
If you fight any more, you’ll die!
206
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,940
Bushy Brows…
207
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,110
What?!
208
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,550
Movement has...
209
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,550
...returned to Lee!
210
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,650
Sensei is smiling and watching me…
211
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,560
And just because of that,
I can come back stronger!
212
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,430
Stronger… stronger still!
213
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,600
Lee’s smiling…even though
he’s been driven into corner.
214
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,970
No.
215
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,540
It’s his turn to do the driving.
216
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,540
Huh?
217
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,640
The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.
218
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,810
Blossoms twice…?
219
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,250
Lee said that too!
220
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,550
The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.
221
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,360
When we meet the next time,
I vow that I will be an even stronger man.
222
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,690
No, Guy!
223
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,560
You haven’t?!
224
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,230
It’s exactly as you imagine.
225
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,430
So that Genin…
226
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,740
that boy can open the Eight Inner Gates
in his body and use the Hidden Lotus…
227
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
The Hidden Lotus?
228
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,110
That’s right …
229
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,940
This is incredible…
230
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,850
Guy…
231
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,820
How many of the Eight Inner Gates
can that boy open now…?
232
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,520
Five gates.
233
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,220
What exactly is it?
234
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,560
These Eight Inner Gates and
that Hidden Lotus?
235
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,560
The Eight Inner Gates are
“Limiter Releases”
236
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,570
used in preparations for
reaching the Hidden Lotus.
237
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,570
A “Limiter Releases”?
238
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
That’s right …
239
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,980
In the Chakra Network
where chakra flows,
240
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,010
there are eight places where the
chakra points are concentrated
241
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,210
in each area of the body from the
head area down--
242
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,250
the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest,
Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,
243
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,420
Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy,
Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.
244
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,390
These are called the Eight Inner Gates.
245
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,360
These eight gates
continually “limit”
246
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,300
the amount of Chakra flowing
through the body…
247
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,170
However, the Lotus’s essence is to force
the boundaries of these “limits” to open…
248
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,710
and bring out several
tens of times the body’s strength.
249
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,250
The Primary Lotus…
250
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,580
opens only the first gate,
the Gate of Opening,
251
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,050
and releases the brains restraints
252
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,220
to bring forth a person’s muscles’ strength
to its fullest!
253
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,690
That’s the kind of technique it is.
254
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,230
So…what is the Hidden Lotus?
255
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:15,210
After forcing the stamina to increase
at the second gate, the Gate of Rest…
256
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,010
From the third gate, the Gate of Life,
one enters the Hidden Lotus!
257
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,010
No way!
258
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,150
Even after using just the Primary Lotus,
his body was in shambles.
259
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,250
So if he uses a technique beyond that…
260
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,520
That’s right.
261
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,550
Huh?
262
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,050
By opening all the 8 gates,
263
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:37,030
one attains strength exceeding
even the Hokage, but in return…
264
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,930
one dies!
265
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,800
I don’t intend to pry into what that
boy means to you
266
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,440
or to tell you not to bring
your personal feelings into play…
267
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,340
But there is a limit!
268
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,540
I’ve misjudged you…Guy!
269
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,980
What do you know…about that boy?!
270
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,020
There is something important which
271
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,860
that boy wants to prove and
protect even if it costs him his life.
272
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,560
I’d like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja
273
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,970
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu and Genjutsu!
274
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,770
That would be the ultimate for me!
275
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,640
That’s why I…
276
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,770
wanted to make him a man
that could protect that thing.
277
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,380
That’s all there is…
278
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,610
Lee!
279
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,980
I’m going to teach you
a new technique.
280
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,550
Yippie, yeah!
281
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,020
– One that will be your trump card.
– Yeah, that's great!
282
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,590
Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!
283
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,890
Lee, listen to my explanation
seriously, all right?!
284
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,260
Y-Yes, Sensei!
285
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,560
Let me first say that...
286
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,770
this is more of a forbidden Jutsu
than the Primary Lotus!
287
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,770
And it will become the
most special technique for you.
288
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,170
Special...?
289
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,940
However...
290
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,550
there is one strict condition
for using this technique.
291
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,220
That is...
292
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,150
That is…
293
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,560
What?
294
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,700
I don’t know what
you’re planning to do…
295
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,570
But this is the end for you.
296
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,800
That’s true…
297
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,610
In any case…
it will be the end with the next.
298
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,580
Neji…
299
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Sasuke…and…
300
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,690
There is no way that I alone
can lose in a place like this!
301
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,720
Guy Sensei…please allow this…!
302
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,960
It is now!
303
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,540
The time to carry through and
protect one’s own Way of the Ninja!
304
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,310
The Third Gate of Life…open!
305
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,600
Hey, can you hear it?
306
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:34,170
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
307
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:43,750
The ocean spans limitlessly
308
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:52,060
Please keep that smile on your face forever
309
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,630
Or else I’ll cry
310
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,870
You won't have to search around you
311
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,540
It’s all ok now.
312
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:15,480
Everyone is inside
this hand
313
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,820
When you want to cry,
and you want to run away
314
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,390
When you forget what happiness is
315
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,190
Just sing.
316
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,560
Light is born, and darkness was born
317
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,770
The two are one
318
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,210
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
319
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,710
Hey, can you hear it?
320
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,250
Effort is always rewarded.
My belief in this has brought me this far.
321
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,520
Neji, Sasuke, and Naruto…
322
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,860
There’s no way that I can lose
in a place like this!
323
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,430
Even though this technique is
my ace in the hole,
324
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,070
I’ll show it especially to you!
325
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,100
This is my ultimate secret
Taijutsu technique!
326
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,910
Next Episode: “The Fifth Gate:
A Splendid Ninja is Born”
327
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,540
This is the end!
//%
1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:09,720
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,970
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,260
One more time
4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,970
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,510
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,220
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,890
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:54,760
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:17,970
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,840
Sasuke's Decision:
Pushed to the Edge!
16
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,050
There you are!
17
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,050
I’m here!
18
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,050
I’m returning them to you!
19
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,550
So it’s a clone…
20
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,430
Bastard!
21
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,390
Sasuke…Uchiha…!
22
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,350
Why won’t you come at me?!
23
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,800
Why…
24
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,510
do you flee?!
25
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,840
Ready?
26
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,140
Over here!
27
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,010
Over here!
28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,510
Wait!
29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,840
Pass!
30
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,600
Here! Good one!
31
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,140
Good! Go! Go! Go!
32
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
Power shot!
33
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,840
What’re we gonna do?
34
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,100
We don’t know any wall-climbing
techniques or anything…
35
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,600
Y-You’re…
36
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,350
This…
37
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,800
It’s Gaara…
38
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,760
Gaara of Sand…
39
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,800
R-Run!
40
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,010
Wait!
41
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,840
Don’t leave me alone!
42
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,840
Help me!
43
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,600
I don't…
44
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,600
want to be alone anymore!
45
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,840
Really…
46
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,550
No!
47
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,720
Gaara! Please calm down!
48
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,350
Yashamaru…
49
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
No escape!
50
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,890
I won’t let you escape!
Sasuke Uchiha!
51
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,350
You’ve gotta be kidding!
What’s with that outrageous strength…?
52
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,840
Are you afraid of me?
53
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,300
It’s too overwhelming…
54
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:43,180
Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of my existence?!
55
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,840
Don’t forget…
You are my prey.
56
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,430
Wait!
57
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,010
Why are you fixated
on me so much?
58
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,840
Those eyes that know true loneliness…
59
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:21,300
And eyes that know that
it is the world’s greatest suffering…
60
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,100
I think I told you.
61
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,890
That you have the same eyes as me.
62
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,430
Eyes that lust for power,
63
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,840
overflowing with hatred
and murderous intent…
64
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,800
The same as me…
65
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,510
Eyes that burn to kill those
who drove you…
66
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,050
into a hell called loneliness!
67
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,840
Such are your eyes.
68
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,510
Okay. Just a minute.
69
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,840
So you’re called Gaara…
70
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,930
I don’t know what you know
about Sasuke, but…
71
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,800
It’s not good for you to
speak as though
72
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
you perceive everything about Sasuke!
73
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,720
What is it that you want to say
to him before the final round,
74
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,510
by pursuing him so far?
75
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,930
A battle is where…
76
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,970
another’s existence and one’s own
existence are put on the line…
77
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,840
and each tries to kill the other!
78
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,180
Only the winner can actually feel
the value of his own existence.
79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,680
In other words,
what you want to say is…
80
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,970
let’s have a killing bout and
not a match?
81
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,470
Uchiha… You really should
be wanting it, too…
82
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,890
in the depths of your soul…
83
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
You want to confirm
the value of your existence.
84
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,800
Am I really, truly powerful?
85
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,140
Is my existence more powerful
than my opponent
86
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,840
who faces me with eyes
filled with intent to kill?
87
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,680
What’s the matter?!
88
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,800
Sasuke Uchiha!
89
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,800
Are you afraid of me?!
90
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,760
Your hatred and intent to kill…
91
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,800
have they given way to fear?
92
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,850
Is that the extent of your existence?!
93
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,180
Fight me…and confirm it!
94
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,550
Your value! Your existence!
95
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,640
Experience it!
96
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,930
If you want an answer…
97
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,640
Come at me!
98
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,890
I was allowed to live…
99
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,350
Only…myself.
100
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
Expressly for what reason?!
101
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,430
No… I know the reason.
102
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,550
The reason that man left me alive
was so he wouldn’t be tormented
103
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,510
by a sense of guilt for having killed
an entire clan…
104
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,180
Itachi chose me as the avenger…
in order to have me kill him!
105
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,600
Now, let me have some fun…
Sasuke Uchiha!
106
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,140
I’ll finish it with one blow!
107
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,100
Hurry up and die,
release yourself from your misery.
108
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,840
You silly old fool…
109
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,680
I believe I told you…
that you would die too!
110
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,350
Bastard!
111
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,510
Let go, you old fool!
112
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,890
I will not let go!
I refuse to let go…
113
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,840
until I have pulled out your soul!
114
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,800
At this rate…
115
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,350
Gaara!
116
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,640
Looks like it worked…
117
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,390
I see! That’s what it was!
118
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
That’s not possible…
119
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,600
He countered Gaara’s attack
in that condition?!
120
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,760
I just realized the reason…
why it’s so fun!
121
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,640
This pain…
122
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,800
To take down an opponent
who wounded me…
123
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,430
and thoroughly destroy him…!
124
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,300
That will make me truly feel alive!
125
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,970
Gaara’s never had a single wound,
but he got Gaara twice.
126
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,050
Is he…a freak?!
127
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,180
No…a true freak is…
128
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,840
After all, the only thing Gaara is
transforming is still just his right arm.
129
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
More, more!
130
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,840
What?!
131
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,390
What the heck is this guy?!
132
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,600
One after another…
133
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,470
Here goes!
134
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,050
He’s even faster!
135
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,970
I can’t dodge unless
I read ahead of his movements.
136
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,350
If I didn’t have these eyes
I’d have died long ago.
137
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,890
I can no longer use Chidori…
138
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,050
Fire Style…
Fire Ball Jutsu!
139
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,890
So the Fire Style doesn’t
work against sand…
140
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,720
Not only that,
this level of Jutsu won’t…
141
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,840
Die!
142
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,140
Apparently…it needs to be Chidori!
143
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,840
Well! Your limit is two shots.
That’s about it…
144
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,390
This is as many Chidori
you can shoot in one day
145
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,640
with your present Chakra.
146
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
After all, this Chidori is a technique
that can only be used
147
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,840
in conjunction with Sharingan
during actual battles.
148
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,640
But using Sharingan and
another Jutsu simultaneously means
149
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,260
exploding and using up the Chakra
in your body all at once.
150
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,890
Well! But you really are
one of the more impressive ones.
151
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,850
Even with my Chidori…
152
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,050
If I use the Lightning Blade
four times in a day,
153
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,050
I’d completely use up my Chakra.
154
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,010
What would happen if I tried
to use more than two shots?
155
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,220
The third shot won’t be activated…
156
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,390
Remember this well!
157
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,180
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
158
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,840
not only will the Jutsu
not properly activate,
159
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,840
but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
160
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,840
And in the worst case, you’ll die!
161
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,510
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.
162
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,180
Especially in your case.
163
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,930
What's the matter?
164
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,010
Does the value of your existence
amount to only this much?
165
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,470
I’ll be blunt…
166
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,840
You are…weak!
167
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,140
You’re too optimistic.
168
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,050
And it’s because your hatred
is weak!
169
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,840
The power of hatred is
the power of the intent to kill!
170
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,850
The power of the intent to kill
is the power of revenge!
171
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,720
Your hatred is weaker than mine!
172
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,390
Shut up…
173
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,850
Do you understand
the meaning of this?!
174
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,680
Shut up!
175
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,100
That means that you…
You are weaker than me!
176
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,390
Itachi chose me to be the avenger…
to have me kill him!
177
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,100
I am an avenger!
178
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,890
The Curse Mark again…
179
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,800
Darn…! My body…
180
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,640
Sasuke!
181
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:28,180
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
182
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:39,510
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
183
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,180
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
184
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,220
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
185
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,640
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
186
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,840
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
187
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:20,930
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
188
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:31,840
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
189
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:42,390
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
190
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,930
Forge on strong
191
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,840
Hey Yashamaru,
what does pain feel like?
192
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,100
I don’t know because
I’ve never been injured…
193
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,050
I was wondering what it’s like.
194
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,430
Could it be that I’m hurt?
195
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,100
I’m not bleeding, but my chest’s
felt weird for a long time.
196
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,840
It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!
197
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,760
Next time:
“Assassin of the Moonlit Night”
//%
1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:09,650
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:17,900
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,190
One more time
4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,900
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,440
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,150
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,820
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,440
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:54,690
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:02,770
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,770
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,900
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:26,770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,770
One more time
15
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,030
His opponent is that Neji, huh…?
16
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,320
The Final Round is altogether different
than the preliminaries…
17
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,610
After all, Naruto may not be able to…
18
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,940
Entertain me a little, Naruto.
19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,690
I’ve got a tough job waiting
for me now, so…
20
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,190
Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot!
21
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,480
Dang it. I can’t catch him at all.
22
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,770
I told you I’m not
such a fool, didn’t I?
23
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,780
I already know…
which one is the real one.
24
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,770
Oh.
25
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,820
That is the body
that has least attacks
26
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,770
due to its fear of having
Chakra Points attacked.
27
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,610
The more you attack,
28
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,650
the more that one body
becomes clearly evident.
29
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,980
You’re the real one.
30
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,530
Naruto…
31
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,360
This is as far as it goes.
32
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,360
I said it was pointless.
33
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,770
Don’t let him beat you, Naruto.
34
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,400
I’ve been telling you not
to frivolously assume things.
35
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,730
What?
36
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,400
It can’t be.
37
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,730
All right! Go, Naruto!
38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,820
Naruto…!
39
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,570
He foiled my idea and purposely
and drew one of his clones back?
40
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,530
I’ve been striking from the beginning,
prepared for an honorable death!
41
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,440
Believe it!
42
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,650
I did it.
43
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,730
That’s…
44
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,900
W-What was that?
45
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,980
Did you think you’d won?
46
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,530
Why?
47
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,770
Naruto’s punch should’ve hit.
48
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,280
That…
49
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,150
Rotation...
50
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,110
That’s Neji’s defense.
51
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,770
You punk.
Don’t make a fool of me.
52
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,280
The largest range of vision of
Neji’s Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.
53
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,770
And he detects all of his opponent’s
attacks with the Byakugan.
54
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,190
His defense technique,
the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,
55
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,360
will begin from here.
56
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,650
The moment he’s attacked,
he discharges a large amount of Chakra
57
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,770
from the Chakra holes in the body,
blocks the enemy’s attack with that Chakra,
58
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,900
moves his own body in a circular motion,
dodges and repels.
59
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,690
Essentially, it’s difficult to control
the Chakra discharged from Chakra holes…
60
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,610
To the extent that even Jonin utilize
the discharge from a part of the body,
61
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,480
like the hands and feet,
in techniques.
62
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,980
But Neji who has mastered
Gentle Fist discharges Chakra
63
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,280
from his entire body and
shuts out physical attacks
64
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,150
just with that discharge power.
65
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,770
In other words,
66
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,770
that’s one more absolute defense
67
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,770
that has more power
than that Gaara’s Sand Shield.
68
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,150
T-That’s father’s…
69
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,360
The Rotation is a secret Art passed down
from generation to generation
70
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,770
only to the Hyuga head family,
in other words the Hyuga clan.
71
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,110
He created that on his own…?
72
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,900
He’s quite the guy…
To think he’d come this far.
73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,360
It’s much too soon to be surprised.
Neji’s true power is still to come.
74
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,900
Dang it.
75
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,980
This is the end.
76
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,940
You’re within the area of my 8 Trigrams.
77
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,400
Gentle Fist Art.
78
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,440
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
79
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,770
It can’t be.
80
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,190
That pose.
81
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,110
8 Tetragrams…
82
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,940
…2 Palms!
83
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,400
4 Palms.
84
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,770
8 Palms.
85
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,610
16 Palms.
86
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,110
32 Palms.
87
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
64 Palms!
88
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,770
The branch family exceeds
the head family?
89
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,030
It’s over.
90
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,400
Truly a terrifying talent.
91
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,610
To think the power of the
Hyuga Kekkei Genkai
92
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,770
would be passed on so strongly
to a child of the branch family
93
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,770
who would never be able
to be an heir.
94
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,900
Hizashi… You should have
succeeded the Hyuga family.
95
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,530
I pressed the 64 Chakra Points
all over your body…
96
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,730
You can’t even stand.
97
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,360
D-Dang it.
98
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,150
Are you frustrated?
99
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,190
Kneeling down before power
that can’t be changed
100
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,030
and knowing your powerlessness.
101
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,480
Your dreams will come true
if you just work hard.
102
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,860
That’s just an illusion.
103
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,770
Hey, Hinata. Are you okay?
104
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,480
Oh, man. I knew it.
105
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,650
Naruto.
106
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,900
Bushy brow…
107
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,770
Hinata.
108
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,650
D-Dang it.
109
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,190
Oh.
110
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,150
Naruto.
111
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,480
He… No way.
112
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,030
I told you, didn’t I…?
113
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,610
I don’t know when to give up.
114
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,190
No way.
115
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,110
Hey, you’re bleeding.
116
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,730
What’s wrong?
117
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,770
You’ve still got damage
from the match.
118
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,110
Hinata… Hang in there.
119
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,860
I’ll take a look at her.
120
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,480
Who’re you?
121
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,690
I’m not suspicious or anything.
122
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,150
Stop already…
123
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,440
It’ll be the same even if
you fight more than this.
124
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,730
I don’t have a grudge particularly
against you.
125
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,770
S-Shut up…
126
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,820
Even if you say so,
I have something against you.
127
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,570
What are you talking about?
128
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,280
Why…? Here you’re this strong…
129
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,230
Why did you, with a look like
you’ve seen through it all,
130
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,780
go after Hinata mentally
who was trying so hard?
131
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,320
It has nothing to do with you.
132
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,570
Mocking Hinata, selfishly labeling
her a failure as you please.
133
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,690
Head family, branch family…
134
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,610
I don’t know what happened to you.
135
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,280
But I won’t forgive the jerk who’d
call another person a failure.
136
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,980
Hey, you.
137
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,650
It’s okay. I’m a doctor.
138
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,780
Okay… Fine.
139
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,280
If you insist, I’ll tell you about
the Hyuga’s destiny of hatred.
140
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,530
In the Hyuga head family,
there’s a secret Ninjutsu
141
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,530
that’s been passed on
from generation to generation.
142
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,900
That is the Curse Mark Arts.
143
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,770
Curse Mark Arts?
144
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,900
The Curse Mark represents
a bird in a cage…
145
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,900
and it’s a mark of those who are
bound to a destiny they can’t escape.
146
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,770
W-What’s…
147
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,770
...t-that mark?
148
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,030
One day when I was four years old,
149
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,190
this accursed mark was inscribed
on my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.
150
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,940
A large ceremony was held in
the Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.
151
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,780
It was also the day when the
head Ninja of the Land of Lightning,
152
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,190
the land that the Leaf had
fought with for many years,
153
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,770
came for the conclusion
of the allied treaty.
154
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,070
However, there was one clan…
155
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,610
who didn’t attend the ceremony
that was attended
156
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,610
by everybody else,
from Leaf Jonin to Genin.
157
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
It was the Hyuga clan…
158
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,360
And it’s because that day
was the day of hope
159
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,770
when the head family heir
was to turn three.
160
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,110
Miss Hinata’s third birthday!
161
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,610
My father, Hizashi Hyuga,
162
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,480
and Miss Hinata’s father who’s over there,
Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.
163
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,860
However, Miss Hinata’s father,
Lord Hiashi,
164
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,770
is the eldest son of the head family
born into this world first.
165
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,480
And my father who was the second son
is a member of the branch family.
166
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,860
So Miss Hinata is already three…
167
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,440
Congratulations.
168
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,530
Thank you.
169
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,770
She’s a cute girl, isn’t she, father?
170
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,650
What’s wrong, father?
171
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,980
Oh, it’s nothing.
172
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,150
Then…
173
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,860
I’ll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.
174
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,150
Yes.
175
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,770
When the head family heir grew
and became three years old,
176
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,940
I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me
and I became the bird in the cage.
177
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,190
And became the Hyuga branch family.
178
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,780
Why’s it necessary to do
something like that?
179
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,940
Why separate into a head family
and a branch family?
180
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,650
What does that weird mark mean?
181
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,570
This mark on my forehead
isn’t just a decoration.
182
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,690
The pull of your legs is weak.
183
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,530
Yes.
184
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,030
Listen, Neji.
185
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,230
You will live to protect Miss Hinata
of the head family
186
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,110
as well as the Hyuga power.
187
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,530
Yes, father.
188
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,440
Murderous Intent.
189
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,770
My head.
190
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,770
Father.
191
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,650
What’s wrong, father?
192
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,770
Go home.
I’ll forgive the fool today only.
193
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,770
You’re not to forget your destiny.
194
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,770
This Curse Mark is the absolute fear
called death so to speak…
195
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,150
that was given to the branch family
by the head family.
196
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,360
The Secret Sign that the
head family members form easily
197
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,770
destroys the cerebral nerves
of those in the branch family.
198
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,940
Of course, killing is easy.
199
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,770
And this mark only goes away
at time of death.
200
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,320
Sealing away the power
of the Byakugan.
201
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,780
The Hyuga family is the clan that possesses
the most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.
202
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,150
There’s no end to those who
target the secret of that distinctive power.
203
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,570
In other words, this Curse Mark
keeps the branch family alive
204
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,860
only to protect the head family
and does not allow disobedience.
205
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,440
And it’s an effective system created
to defend for eternity
206
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,770
the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.
207
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,730
And then, that incident occurred.
208
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,770
My father was killed by
the head family.
209
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,570
One night, Miss Hinata was
snatched up by someone.
210
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,770
At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately
rushed off and killed the abductor.
211
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,780
Who do you think that person was…
212
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,110
who was in the shadows,
and also wearing a mask?
213
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,030
It was the head ninja of
the Land of Lightning
214
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,780
who had just completed
the allied treaty.
215
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
It was clear that he came targeting
the secret of Byakugan from the start.
216
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,320
However, the Land of Lightning
exploited the killing of their own Ninja
217
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,860
due to a botched plan…
218
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,770
and set an outrageous condition in
violation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf.
219
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,980
Naturally, things got worse and worse,
220
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,650
and there was almost a war
between the Leaf and the Lightning.
221
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,400
However, the Leaf who
wanted to avoid war
222
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,280
made a deal with the Lightning.
223
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,320
A deal?
224
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,440
The Lightning demand was
the body of the Hyuga head family
225
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,320
who possesses Byakugan,
the Kekkei Genkai…
226
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,070
In other words,
the body of Lord Hiashi.
227
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,530
And the Leaf accepted the condition.
228
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,320
What? But, father…
229
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,230
And war was safely avoided.
230
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,400
Thanks to my father who was killed
as a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,
231
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,690
to protect the head family!
232
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,860
Other than dying, there’s no other way
to escape this accursed Curse Mark.
233
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,230
Even though they were twins
with nearly equal power,
234
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,770
their destinies were already set by
who was born first and born later.
235
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,480
And then, this match…
236
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,440
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.
237
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,190
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
238
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,690
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
239
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,070
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
240
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,440
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
241
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,770
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
242
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:53,110
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
243
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,940
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
244
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,400
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
245
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,770
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
246
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,030
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
247
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,320
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
248
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
249
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:37,230
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
250
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,530
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
251
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,610
Are all my Chakra Points
really closed?
252
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,980
Darn. I cannot feel any Chakra
remaining in my body at all…
253
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,820
just like when I used up all my Chakra
in my training with the Pervy Sage.
254
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,190
Wait. I got it. Just watch me!
255
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
I will squeeze out
my Chakra no matter what!
256
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,730
Next time,  “A Failure’s True Power.”
//%
1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,730
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:17,980
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,280
One more time
4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,980
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,230
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,900
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:45,530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,770
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,770
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,820
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,980
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,820
One more time
15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,770
Naruto…!
16
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,650
He came in totally late.
17
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,770
Hmm? Where’s Sasuke?
18
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,320
The Dosu guy I’m supposed
to fight isn’t here, either.
19
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,480
Hey, you guys over there.
20
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,820
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!
21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,110
You guys are the stars
of this “final round”!
22
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,770
Sasuke hasn’t been found yet?
23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,440
A team of several Anbu members
are searching all over,
24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,770
but they have found nothing.
25
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,360
He might already be in
the hands of Orochimaru…
26
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,400
If that’s the case,
we may never find him.
27
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,190
I understand.
28
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,610
Well-well… Lord Kazekage.
29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,440
You must be tired having
come all this way.
30
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,030
No…I’m glad the arena
is in the Leaf Village.
31
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,570
Even though you’re still young, it would
probably be a tough journey for you
32
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,320
if you had to go to the trouble
of traveling someplace else.
33
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,770
Shouldn’t you decide on
the Fifth Hokage soon?
34
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,980
Please don’t treat me
like an old person.
35
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,690
I’m still planning on
being Hokage for another five years…
36
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,940
Now then, I guess it’s
about time to begin.
37
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:11,770
Everyone, thank you very much
for coming
38
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,610
to the Village Hidden in Leaves
Chunin Exam.
39
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,480
We will now begin the
“final round” matches
40
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,230
for the eight who made it
through the preliminaries!
41
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,770
Please watch until the end!
42
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,070
If there are supposed to be eight,
it looks like there’s one missing.
43
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,610
I have something to tell
you before the match.
44
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,360
Look at this.
45
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,400
Huh?!
46
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,440
There was a slight change
to the tournament.
47
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,820
Check who you’ll be facing
one more time.
48
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,770
Here, I had more preliminary
matches than the others…
49
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,440
So the Dosu guy dropped out?
50
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,770
I thought I’d pound you here…
51
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,860
If I did that,
there’d be the possibility for me,
52
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,770
as the one remaining after
the first battle, to fight Sasuke.
53
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,770
W-What are you?!
54
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,070
Say…
55
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,360
…say.
56
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,980
What?
57
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,320
Umm…Sasuke still hasn’t come.
58
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,770
What’ll happen?
59
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,070
I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak out
of the hospital room at that time.
60
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,190
Something could’ve happened to him…
61
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,480
In case a competitor does not arrive
by the start time of his match…
62
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
he or she will lose by default!
63
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,650
It doesn’t make sense.
64
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,770
Knowing his character,
he’d come even if he had to drag himself.
65
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,730
Where are you going, Gaara?
66
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,610
To verify my existence…
one more time.
67
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,770
One more time.
68
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,070
What’s wrong?
You should still be able to move, right?!
69
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,480
Sasuke! Come on!
70
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,400
Could it be…?
71
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,110
Even after I warned him to avoid
doing anything to stand out…
72
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,440
He didn’t kill that Sasuke Uchiha
also, did he…?
73
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,940
Listen up, you guys.
74
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,070
The terrain is different,
but the rule is that there are no rules,
75
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,570
the same as
in the preliminaries.
76
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,770
The matches will continue until one
or the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.
77
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,900
However, if I judge that it has been settled,
I’ll stop the match there.
78
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,150
Arguments will not be allowed.
79
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,280
Understood?
80
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,230
So the first match is…
81
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,110
Naruto Uzumaki.
82
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,730
Neji Hyuga.
83
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,110
Just those two remain and
the rest of you go to the waiting room.
84
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,110
Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!
85
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,230
Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.
86
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,770
Uh-huh.
87
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,770
This match will be quite interesting!
88
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,280
Naruto…
89
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,770
Say, Sakura.
90
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,570
I understand that you’re worried
about Sasuke.
91
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,770
But why don’t you cheer
for Naruto at least a little bit?
92
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,650
Hmm. You’re right.
93
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,980
That being said,
94
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,980
with Neji as his opponent,
Naruto has no chance of winning.
95
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,770
That is…!
96
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,320
Not so, is what you’re
going to say?
97
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,280
But to think that brat would
survive until this point…
98
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,940
I wonder if this is
as far as it goes
99
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,860
for those who survived
just by luck, after all.
100
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,770
That Naruto.
101
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,110
This is not a good opponent at all.
102
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,730
No matter how you look at it,
he can’t beat the Hyuga clan.
103
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,610
Well, that’s what I thought
at the beginning…
104
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,770
But you’ll all be surprised
if you underestimate him.
105
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,900
Akamaru, what’s wrong?
106
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,150
What did you say?!
107
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,770
What?! Where?!
108
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,820
There!
109
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,780
What’s Anbu, the Black Ops,
doing here?
110
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,530
Is something going on…?
111
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,480
You seem like you want
to say something.
112
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,770
I said it before, too, didn’t I?
113
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,860
A failure is a failure.
You can’t change.
114
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,280
I promise …
115
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,070
I’ll win, no matter what!
116
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,190
He has the look…
of being sure of himself…
117
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,900
It’s as if he’s not all worked up…
118
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,780
That makes it
more worthwhile for me.
119
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,650
I look forward to your look
of disappointment…
120
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,440
when you know the true reality…
121
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,770
Stop whining.
122
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,110
Let’s…get started!
123
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,860
Now then, round one.
124
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,690
Begin!
125
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,650
Watch carefully, Hanabi.
126
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,690
Nobody has inherited such
a strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.
127
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,770
To say nothing of your older sister.
128
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,190
More than big sister?
129
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,860
Perhaps more than you, too.
130
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,770
This time, it’s not an opponent
that can be managed easily.
131
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,360
He has that Byakugan.
132
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,900
Close combat is no good…
133
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,770
Does Naruto know that?
134
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,070
Idiot! Why would anyone
attack from the front?!
135
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,900
No! Naruto.
136
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,770
The opponent can see
your Chakra Points!
137
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,820
They're called Chakra Points.
138
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,230
If those pressure points
are pressed accurately…
139
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,070
the flow of an opponent’s Chakra
can be stopped,
140
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,360
amplified or controlled at will.
141
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,070
Uh-oh!
142
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,770
I missed, huh…?
143
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,110
In other words, he’ll press
the pressure point if I get too close
144
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,770
and I’ll become unable
to use Jutsu.
145
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,150
That means all I can do
is fight from a distance.
146
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,530
You understand, right?
You have no way of winning.
147
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,280
Heh… All I did was to verify your power.
148
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,690
The real fight is just getting started!
149
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,400
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
150
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,530
You used your head,
didn’t you, Naruto?!
151
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,280
With the Shadow Clone Jutsu…
152
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,190
Heh. He’s an interesting kid.
153
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,820
Shadow Clone Jutsu is
a Jonin level technique.
154
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,280
To think he could use
such an Jutsu…
155
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,650
Who knows how this’ll turn out?
156
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,980
Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
157
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,770
I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributed
among the clones,
158
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,320
indeed, I can’t detect the
real one even with my Byakugan.
159
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,070
But there’s only one real one,
after all!
160
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,690
Heh. Don’t be acting tough!
161
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,610
If you’re going to come,
then come.
162
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,770
It’s pointless.
163
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,770
In front of that Neji’s defense,
it’s not just all attacking.
164
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,730
Hey!
165
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,190
Don’t…you…underestimate…
166
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,480
…me!
167
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,780
Here they come!
168
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,530
He hit!
169
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,770
Fool.
170
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,770
Wha--?!
171
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,730
Dang it!
172
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,030
I’ll get you next time!
173
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,980
Here!
174
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,690
This guy…
175
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,770
Does he have eyes behind him…?
176
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,530
You’re going to become…
the Hokage…?
177
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,730
With this level, it’s impossible.
178
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,770
I can generally tell
with these eyes…
179
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,070
Intrinsic abilities are set.
180
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,860
Figuratively speaking,
everything inherent about people is set.
181
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,230
Why…?
182
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,440
Why are you always so
judgmental like that?
183
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,440
Then…are you going to say
that anybody can become the Hokage…
184
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,770
if they just work hard?
185
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,860
Only a very small percentage of
Shinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!
186
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,400
Look more at reality!
187
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,190
Those who become the Hokage
are born with a destiny.
188
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,650
It’s not something you become
by trying to become it.
189
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,480
It’s determined by destiny.
190
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,190
People must live within
their different respective currents
191
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,150
that can’t be defied.
192
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:26,070
The one single…
destiny everyone has equally…
193
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,320
...is death.
194
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,780
Those eyes…
195
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,980
He still holds a grudge
against the head family, huh?
196
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,940
So…
197
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,320
So what?!
198
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,480
I don’t know when to give up!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
199
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,570
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
200
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,820
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
201
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,440
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
202
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,770
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
203
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:46,110
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
204
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
205
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,320
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
206
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,770
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
207
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,980
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
208
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,400
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
209
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,690
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
210
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,940
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
211
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:37,610
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
212
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:44,770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
213
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,690
Darn it! What is going on?!
214
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,610
It was clear that my punch got him,
but I’m the one who was thrown!
215
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,820
Darn it!
Even though I promised Hinata….
216
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,730
I really cannot lose at
a place like this!
217
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,440
The next hit will be the big one
that I’m gonna give him!
218
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,770
Just prepare for it!
219
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,770
Next time, “Ultimate Defense:
Zero Blind Spot!”
220
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,770
I hardly give up things!
//%
1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,180
One more time
4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,840
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:45,430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,680
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,300
Uh oh!
16
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,220
Pakkun?
17
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,890
Sakura?
18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,350
Why did you stop
all of a sudden?!
19
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,800
The scents of Sasuke and the other two…
are quickly moving away!
20
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,140
It smells like Sasuke is
chasing those two people…
21
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,840
What?!
22
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,840
Sasuke is?
23
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,260
There are no other signs
of movement.
24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
But…
25
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,430
Let’s not just stand around.
Let’s go after Sasuke right away!
26
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,680
But…what?
27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,840
The people who are left are going
to fight each other.
28
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,760
We’ll end up taking a little longer way…
29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,760
but all there is for us to do
is to avoid it.
30
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,510
Why?! If we do that, it’ll only delay our
catching up to Sasuke.
31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Let’s just speed on through!
32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,760
What are you saying, Naruto?!
33
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,640
We don’t know what’ll happen
in the battle zone!
34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,840
Even if we don't desire it,
35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,470
there’s a possibility that
we’ll be irrepressibly caught up in a battle.
36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,800
That doesn’t have anything
to do with it!
37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Kid! Our mission is to bring
Sasuke back.
38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,840
So the cardinal rule is to avoid battle
as much as possible until then!
39
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,430
– Let’s go! 					– Got it!
40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,010
Fine!
41
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,470
Puppet Master Jutsu!
42
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,840
I’m from the Aburame Clan
of the Leaf Village…
43
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,430
When we fight,
we never underestimate our opponent,
44
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,840
no matter what puny insects
they may be.
45
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,050
I’ll advance with full force!
46
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,640
Bring it!
47
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,050
Put me down, Temari.
48
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,100
Can you move, Gaara?
49
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,840
Gaara!
50
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,140
Kankuro is delaying Uchiha now.
51
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,930
We must use this opening…
52
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,640
If we don’t get a move on,
the operation will…
53
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,600
Huh?!
54
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,840
Temari, go over there.
55
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,550
What?
56
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,840
Just beat it! You’re in the way!
57
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,180
Astonishing Truth!
Gaara’s Identity Emerges!
58
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,720
Poison on the blade!
59
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,890
I won’t let you get away!
60
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,840
That’s… Sasuke Uchiha!
Did he get past Kankuro?!
61
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,800
No… No matter how you look at it,
it’s too soon.
62
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,550
Did another assailant come?
63
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,180
I don’t know what you Sand Ninja
are scheming…
64
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,100
but I’ll stop you!
65
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,220
And…
66
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,260
I’ll ascertain your true identity!
67
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,600
Gaara!
68
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,470
Don’t tell me…!
69
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,640
Is he going to rouse that thing
in a place like this?!
70
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
This is no joke…
lt’s out of my hands.
71
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,220
Stop, Gaara!
Have you forgotten the operation?!
72
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,470
You who are strong…
You who are called Uchiha…
73
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,680
You who have friends…
74
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,930
You who have a purpose…
75
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,300
You who are like…me!
76
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,840
By killing you…
77
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,890
I will exist in this world as
the one who destroyed all of that…
78
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,390
I can truly experience “life.”
79
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,100
What is it?
80
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,850
It’s so obvious if you release
such a blood-thirsty aura…
81
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,840
Come on out.
82
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,350
So it’s you, eh…
83
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,840
What’s your purpose?
Why do you seek power?
84
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,140
It ‘s none of your business.
85
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,840
Beat it!
You’re a hindrance to my training.
86
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,470
You…
87
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
have the same eyes as I do.
88
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,640
Eyes that seek power,
brimming with hate and murderous intent.
89
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,140
You’re like me.
90
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Don’t forget… You’re my…
91
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,510
You’re…
92
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,430
my…
93
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,600
You're…my…
94
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,760
my prey!
95
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,840
It’s started…!
96
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,840
A Substitution?!
97
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,550
You’re naive.
98
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,050
All right!
99
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,840
Insects?!
100
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,390
To think you’d make
a clone out of insects and
101
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,100
wrap around behind me…
102
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,350
Not bad!
103
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,430
Your reach encompasses from medium
to long distance and you use a puppet.
104
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,800
I didn't think you would
do well in close combat.
105
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,840
With that Puppet Master Jutsu
where you have to concentrate
106
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
on the control of the puppet…
107
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,470
the one casting the Jutsu is
prone to openings in defense.
108
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,390
You’re very aware of the weakness
of a puppet master!
109
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,010
However, from here on,
110
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,640
I’ll show you the essence of
this Ninjutsu fighting style!
111
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,640
The real terror of Crow…
my puppet of warfare!
112
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,840
This is Poison Smoke Bomb!
113
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,350
Did I inhale…a little bit?
114
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,390
I get it…
And the caster of the Jutsu hides, eh?
115
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Listen, everyone…
116
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,470
Even if enemy Shinobi appear,
don’t panic.
117
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,350
Go into the hidden room quickly.
118
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,840
Your Jonin and Chunin Senseis
will protect you all with their lives!
119
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,930
Oh!
120
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,890
Konohamaru…
121
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,890
It’ll be okay!
122
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,300
Everyone’s doing their best.
123
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,140
They can drive away
the enemies right away.
124
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,430
Cracks in the face rock
of the Hokage Lords…
125
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,840
How ominous…
126
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,970
Grandpa…
127
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,840
To have come this far…
To have come this far…!
128
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:39,890
Do I already lack the power
to drag out his soul?
129
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,390
With this feeble body…
130
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,600
even though I’m prepared to die,
is it not enough…?!
131
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,840
You probably could’ve killed me
if you’d been ten years younger.
132
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Sarutobi! If you don’t kill him now,
the village is doomed!
133
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,800
Do you understand?!
134
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,890
I…understand!
135
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,640
Useless…old man…
136
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,050
Now…Let me feel it!
137
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,840
That eye!
138
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,510
That eye…from before!
139
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,470
This doesn’t look like it’ll end
by the time you come for back-up…
140
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,140
Shino…
141
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,350
It looks like the poison has
slowly started to circulate.
142
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,850
I’ll finish this!
143
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,550
Insects, again?!
144
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,890
But he shouldn’t be able to
move so much in that state…
145
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,800
I’ll make things easier for you…
146
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Hey! What’s wrong?!
147
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,220
What’s happening…?
148
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
Don’t tell me…!
149
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,800
It’s futile…
He can’t move anymore…
150
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,970
I had the beetles burrow
into every joint…
151
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,350
He stuffed beetles into its joints
so that the puppet can’t move?
152
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,720
That was his aim from the beginning!
153
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,350
The beetles are passing through
the threads of my Chakra…
154
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,850
Why…?
155
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,840
That’s it!
As I recall, their food is Chakra.
156
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,390
At this rate,
my location will be found out!
157
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,010
He cut the Chakra threads himself…?
158
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,680
You got careless!
159
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,890
Instantly reattaching the Chakra threads
that have once been cut
160
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,430
is simple for a first-rate puppet master.
161
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,550
And…
162
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,840
Crow is a puppet…
163
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,850
that has a weapon in each
and every component of the body!
164
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,970
It’s a big mistake if you think
this has ended…
165
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,260
by your stopping my movements!
166
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,760
There’s lots of poison
on the tip of the needle…
167
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,470
Die!
168
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,510
What?!
169
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,430
Just like that, the insects…!
170
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,510
The Chakra threads have been
bitten through!
171
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,840
What?! Why…?!
172
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,970
Where did these insects
spring out from?!
173
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,840
By beating away the bait insects
along the Chakra threads,
174
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,050
you dropped your guard.
175
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,470
You didn’t notice…
the wriggling insects behind you.
176
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,470
The insects were moving
the whole time…
177
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,050
heading for your headband.
178
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,260
W-What did you say?!
179
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,220
The one blow earlier…
180
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,840
I pretended to miss and
stuck one of those beetles on you.
181
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,840
But how did you know where I was
with one such beetle…?
182
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,840
I…hate explaining the same thing twice.
183
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,890
Shino? 					Why are you here?!
184
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,760
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena!
185
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,430
The females have almost no smell…
186
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,680
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.
187
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,550
Then, this one beetle on my forehead…
188
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,720
Right… It’s a female.
189
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,930
The poison has circulated
through my whole body, huh…
190
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,180
It looks like I won’t be able
to go to back you up…
191
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,510
I’m sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.
192
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,430
Is he a…monster?
193
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,760
Are you scared of me, Sasuke Uchiha?!
194
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,800
Of my existence?!
195
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,350
Come out… 					Sasuke Uchiha!
196
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,760
You’re…my…
197
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,640
prey!
198
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:27,970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
199
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:39,300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
200
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
201
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
202
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
203
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
204
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
205
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:31,640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
206
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:42,180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
207
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,840
Forge on strong
208
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
What a speed and strength!
209
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,840
If I didn’t use my Sharingan
to foresee his movement,
210
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,470
I would have been in pieces!
211
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,600
But a merely defensive battle
will do no good.
212
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,100
What do I do?
213
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,180
How should I stop him?
Do I need to use that…?
214
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,930
But Chidori may not…
215
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,970
Next time: “Sasuke’s Decision:
Pushed to the Edge!”
//%
1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,190
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,090
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,200
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,960
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,140
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,170
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,450
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,020
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,410
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,210
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,380
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,720
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,550
Hey you, failure.
20
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,020
I have two pieces
of advice for you.
21
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,820
First, if you intend to call
yourself a Shinobi,
22
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,260
stop that revolting cheering of yours.
23
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,060
And second...
24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,660
a failure will
always be a failure.
25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,630
There's no changing that!
26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,670
Do you want to see about that?
27
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,810
You!
28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,020
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.
29
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,250
But all fighting must be done
officially in a match!
30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,060
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort…
31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,800
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?
32
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,270
I promise you.
33
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,110
I will win no matter what!
34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,560
Gaara vs. Rock Lee:
The Power of Youth Explodes!
35
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
Hey, Choji!
36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,960
You're in trouble.
37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,570
Only the strong ones are left.
38
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,400
Probably the strongest of Hidden Sound
must be that bloke.
39
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,380
And Lee is apparently strong
enough to take on Sasuke!
40
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,180
And particularly that Sand guy!
41
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,550
He's probably
the most dangerous one!
42
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,820
I-I don't care!
43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,560
I plan to forfeit right away
if that happens…
44
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,860
So that means…
45
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,490
Huh?
46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,360
...you plan to forego
all-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,570
What? Come on!
48
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,270
Don’t worry.
49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,600
If things start getting ugly,
50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,540
I'll step in and stop the fight,
like I did for Hinata. Okay?
51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,610
Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
52
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,150
– You can eat what you want.
– Don't dangle food in front of him!
53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,250
– Besides he didn't step in...
– You can eat whatever you want...
54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,020
– and stop the fight for Hinata.
– and all you want.
55
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,560
B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!
All you can eat!
56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,560
He doesn't look good.
57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,300
Watching the previous fight…
58
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,540
Did it get stirred up?
59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,340
His inner demon!
60
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,480
I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too…
61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,550
Here's a plan.
62
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,480
Kankuro?
63
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,190
Just a little
information-gathering mission.
64
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,560
Hey!
65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,220
Huh?
66
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,630
What are you doing here
all by yourself?
67
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,460
Shouldn't you be with your friends?
68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
I-It's none of your business, is it?!
69
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,970
Hmmm. Well, well…
70
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,440
That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?
71
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,710
Well, it seems to me that
72
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,540
he didn't reveal the true extent
of his power in that last match.
73
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,680
What's he about?
74
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm going to crush him!
75
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,550
Err, that's not what
I was asking.
76
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,560
Besides, this guy’s way out of his league...
77
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,230
You seem like a fun guy.
I quite like you.
78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,570
You're dull.
And I don't like you at all!
79
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,540
I'm going to waste this guy!
80
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,840
We will now resume the battle.
81
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,550
Okay!
82
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,750
You'll be up this time for sure.
Go for it, Lee!
83
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,550
No!
84
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,420
– Huh? 					– What?
85
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,690
Seeing as I've come this far,
I rather be the last!
86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
Is Lee sulking?
87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,030
Hurry up and get down here…
88
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
Safe!
89
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,100
– Hey!
– Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
90
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,470
Gaara vs. Rock Lee
91
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh! Lee!
92
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,610
It worked!
93
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,550
If you say you want to go last,
then you won't be last.
94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,320
It's an application of the same law
95
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,890
that says a stone thrown to hit
a telephone pole will miss,
96
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,860
and a stone thrown to miss
will be a direct hit!
97
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,130
Right! That's my student!
98
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,630
I absolutely did not
want to go last!
99
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,560
I threw them a beauty of a curve!
100
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,070
Threw whom a curve?
101
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,900
Okay, so let me give you
a little piece of “nice” advice.
102
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,140
Right!
103
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,540
Probably no one has noticed yet, but…
104
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,950
That gourd is suspicious!
105
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,550
I see!
106
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,220
Quit with the notes!
107
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,550
You're not going to have time to
read them during the match! Fool!
108
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,550
I see!
109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
He didn't realize that?
110
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,260
Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
111
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,670
All right! 					Go! Lee!
112
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,730
Yeah!
113
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,710
I am very happy to be squaring
off with you so early in the match.
114
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't know what kind of moves
that bowl-cut guy has,
115
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
but he will never take Gaara.
116
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Never!
117
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,730
He's fast, to be sure,
but his kick is not all that great.
118
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,500
No…
119
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,610
He's... strong!
120
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,220
Please don't be in such a hurry.
121
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,460
Lee…
122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Be careful, Lee.
123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,210
Now then… The 9th match...
124
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,840
Begin!
125
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,920
Leaf Hurricane!
126
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,570
Is that…?
127
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,540
Sand?
128
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,540
What an unusual Jutsu…
129
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,110
There's sand in his gourd!
130
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,710
That's…
131
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,550
That's it?
132
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,690
Desert Coffin!
133
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,260
Desert Burial!
134
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,170
Not another horror story like that…
135
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,440
A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
136
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,140
Sounds like trouble.
137
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,180
But let's give it a go!
138
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,540
Even that Lee’s fast strikes…
139
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,140
have no effect at all!
140
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,550
What's the deal?!
141
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,620
No physical strike is going to
have any effect on him.
142
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,480
What?
143
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,650
The Sand shields and protects Gaara
144
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,920
on its own accord, independently
of any intent on Gaara's part.
145
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,860
That's why... no one has been able
to do it so far....
146
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,630
Injure Gaara, that is.
147
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,010
Curses! He's not moving
a muscle and still...!
148
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,340
Is that it?
149
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,110
Entertain me a bit more…
150
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
There's not enough yet!
151
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,220
Blood!
152
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,340
Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
153
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,810
He'll never be able to get close
enough for that!
154
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,640
Why doesn't he step back a bit and
use Ninjutsu or something?
155
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,510
It’s not that he doesn't use it.
156
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,420
He can’t use it.
157
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,480
Huh?
158
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,020
Lee has almost no Ninjutsu
or Genjutsu skills.
159
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,760
N-No way!
160
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,000
When I first met Lee,
he was completely inept.
161
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,960
He had no talent whatsoever.
162
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,400
What? I can't believe that!
163
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,400
Hey hey!
164
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,070
Certainly…
165
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,550
A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu is a rarity.
166
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:57,550
That’s why, the only path open to Lee
as a Ninja was Taijutsu.
167
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,560
But! That's precisely what
makes him a winner!
168
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,460
Huh?
169
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,460
Lee, take them off!
170
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,660
B-But Guy Sensei...!
171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,500
You told me only to do that
172
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,170
to protect a large group
of very important people!
173
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,770
That’s quite all right!
174
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,470
I give you permission!
175
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,050
Are those…?
176
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,550
Weights?
177
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,190
That's some cliché training…
178
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,560
I see!
179
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
Ridiculous!
180
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,430
All right, now I can
move easily!
181
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,570
Humph! Does he think
removing some measly little weights
182
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,900
is going to enable him to
outmaneuver Gaara's sand…?
183
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,310
A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
184
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,680
Go, Lee!
185
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,720
Right!
186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,570
Go!
187
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,570
Very close!
188
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,070
Fast!
189
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,400
Amazing…!
190
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,880
Because he can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu...
191
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,180
Therefore, he channeled all
of his time,
192
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,550
all of his energy and...
193
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,460
all of his being into Taijutsu.
194
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,860
Though he can’t do any other Jutsu…
195
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
He won't lose to anyone…
196
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,300
He is a Taijutsu specialist!
197
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,510
I can't believe it!
Gaara's been injured!
198
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,550
No way...!
199
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,690
Bushy-Brows is even
faster than before!
200
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,890
Was he this strong?!
201
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,130
Youth is... explosion!
202
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,570
Right!
203
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,010
Over here!
204
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,510
Good!
205
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,250
I got him good!
206
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,190
A-Amazing, he's so fast!
207
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,820
The Sand Shield can't keep
up with him!
208
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
A direct hit!
209
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,690
A-Amazing.
210
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,560
His strikes are lightning fast…!
211
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,630
I can't even track him
with my eyes!
212
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,440
Uh oh…
213
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,350
Uh oh is right!
214
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,420
That black-circles-under-the-eye
guy is taking some serious blows!
215
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,420
That's not what I meant.
216
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,250
Huh?
217
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,600
W-What the…?!
218
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,540
His face is crumbling right off…!
219
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,010
His whole body is covered
with sand….
220
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,940
There's not a scratch on him!
221
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,350
W-What’s with this guy?!
222
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,520
Sure enough, he was
encased in sand, eh.
223
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,860
But, it's been a long time since
224
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,030
I've seen that expression
on Gaara's face.
225
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,560
I felt that he was becoming
more and more unstable
226
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,270
as the Chunin Exam progressed…
227
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,840
So Gaara's other self has
been awakened, eh?
228
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,550
Hey! What is that?
229
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,620
That protected him
against Bushy-Brow's strikes?
230
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,550
Yes… It's Sand Armor.
231
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,950
Armor?
232
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,560
Ordinarily, the Sand Shield
functions to protect him automatically,
233
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,560
but, if by chance,
the Shield is penetrated,
234
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,130
the Sand Armor functions as a second
layer of protection against strikes…
235
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,800
That's Gaara's…absolute defense!
236
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,770
Well then, there's no way
to get him!
237
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,910
He doesn't have any weak points.
238
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,140
No. That’s not entirely true…
239
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,150
The Sand Armor is actually
riddled with weak points.
240
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,550
First of all, because it's not automatic,
it uses up a lot of Chakra.
241
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,250
It's also less effective
than the Sand Shield,
242
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,560
and it takes an enormous amount
of physical energy
243
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
to keep the sand clinging
to the body like that.
244
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:07,560
Gaara's having to use the armor...
is proof that he's under pressure.
245
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,800
That Lee is really good…
246
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,270
But, the outcome of the match
is already a given.
247
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,280
He will never beat Gaara!
248
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,610
Is that all?
249
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,920
But what an incredible
defense he has...
250
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,250
no amount of speed is going
to let me get a strike through.
251
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,260
I'll have to do major damage
from above the sand guard.
252
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
That will be Lotus!
253
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,930
Yes.
254
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,050
Be ready!
255
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,960
A thin sand guard like that
will be inconsequential
256
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,930
in the face of Lee's high-speed
Lotus slamming down from above.
257
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,360
Hurry up and bring it on!
258
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,570
You asked for it!
259
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,340
He didn’t float.
260
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Not just yet!
261
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,150
What an amazing series of kicks!
262
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,820
Even an ordinary Lotus has
a tremendous strain on the body…!
263
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,890
Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
264
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,710
Take this!
265
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,540
Primary Lotus!
266
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,640
I got him...
267
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,410
good!
268
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,710
Right on!
269
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,750
I-It's over!
270
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,980
W-What? This can’t be!
271
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,050
He did it! Lee’s won!
272
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,250
Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
273
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,160
Wha--?!
274
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,470
Huh?!
275
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,820
What?!
276
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,830
Hey, can you hear it?
277
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,400
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
278
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:39,980
The ocean spans limitlessly
279
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,250
Please keep that smile on your face forever
280
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,860
Or else I’ll cry
281
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,960
You won't have to search around you
282
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,600
It’s all ok now.
283
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:11,540
Everyone is inside
this hand
284
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,010
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
285
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,550
When you forget what happiness is
286
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,390
Just sing.
287
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,630
Light is born, and darkness was born
288
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,960
The two are one
289
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,440
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
290
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,940
Hey, can you hear it?
291
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,250
Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
292
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,550
All of your strength seems
to have disappeared!
293
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,490
You're going to be destroyed
at this rate!
294
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,690
But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
295
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,060
How can he continue to keep up
a fighting stance
296
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,930
when he's being routed like this?!
297
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,600
Next episode: "Lee’s Hidden Strength:
Forbidden Secret Jutsu!"
298
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,000
The expression in Bushy-Brows’ eyes
has changed!
//%
1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,010
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,470
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,680
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,180
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,100
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,430
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
Two Heartbeats:
Kabuto's Trap
21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,550
Huh?!
22
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,890
It can’t be!
23
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,720
Even if you put up a bluff
I can foresee …
24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,390
that you are already…finished.
25
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,590
Poor thing.
26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,640
This child is trembling
like a puppy
27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,100
Now, Kabuto…
28
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,510
Get rid of her,
but don’t make her suffer.
29
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,590
I understand.
30
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,470
Sasuke…
31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
I-I’ll do anything for you!
32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,600
So I’m begging you…
Please stay here!
33
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,510
You are really annoying.
34
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,800
Please don’t go!
35
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,180
Sakura…
36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,970
Thank you…
37
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,890
Sasuke…
38
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,890
Wait!
39
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,300
Hmm?
40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,600
Did you…say something?
41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,220
Wait!
42
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,760
Where’s Sasuke!
Where is Sasuke?
43
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,590
It couldn’t be that…
your body is already Sasuke's…?
44
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,350
There’s no need to keep it
a secret any longer.
45
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,550
It’s all right, Kabuto,
go on and tell her.
46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,590
He was a little late
in getting here.
47
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,140
Lord Orochimaru wasn’t able to
wait for Sasuke,
48
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,140
and already had been reincarnated
into another vessel.
49
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,850
So Sasuke is all right?!
Somewhere in this building…
50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,010
Lord Orochimaru gave Sasuke
the Curse Mark,
51
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,430
so he could wait for
the next opportunity to reincarnate.
52
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,430
But…
53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,100
Not all humans can
tolerate Curse Marks.
54
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,390
No way, there’s no way
that Sasuke could be…
55
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,350
That’s right, Sasuke wasn’t able
to tolerate the Curse Mark
56
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,470
and so he died.
57
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,010
That's a lie.
58
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,590
It has to be a lie!
59
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,430
What would telling a lie
like that accomplish?
60
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,590
To someone that’s going to die…
As you are?
61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,600
If you want to see him that badly
I’ll let you see him.
62
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,510
When you die, you can see him
in the other world.
63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
Sasuke…
64
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,300
Sakura!
65
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,890
Sakura, don't you believe…
66
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,390
what a guy like him says!
67
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,260
Naruto!
68
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,590
So it’s Naruto, I thought you’d drowned
and died a long time ago but…
69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,260
When I make a promise
I don’t give up.
70
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,720
That's my Way of Ninja!
71
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,720
I ain't gonna die,
until I get Sasuke back!
72
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,590
This is interesting!
73
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,800
Sakura, go hide!
74
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,010
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,010
I’m over here!
76
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,180
Hey stupid, over here!
Over here, over here!
77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,590
Where’re you looking?
I’m over here! Over here!
78
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,800
What’re you doing? Hey!
79
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,510
So you’ve used up all
your Kunai Knives…
80
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,590
I’m gonna…completely blow you away!
81
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,390
How annoying!
82
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,050
Fire Style:
83
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,850
Misty Flames Dance Jutsu!
84
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,680
– Ouch! 					– That’s hot!
85
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,930
– Yikes! 					– Oww!
86
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,100
You’re too slow!
87
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,590
Rasengan!
88
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,590
Naruto!
89
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,390
Since you and Orochimaru are here,
90
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,590
it means Sasuke is probably here too!
91
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,050
Tell us the truth right now!
92
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,050
Wh-What the heck?
My body won’t move…
93
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,600
Have a good look at yourself.
94
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,760
Wh-What’s this?
95
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,550
Those are Chakra Threads.
96
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
Chakra Threads?
97
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,510
While you were attacking earlier,
98
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,470
I wrapped the thread around you.
99
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,720
Take a good look at where
that thread is connected.
100
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,510
That’s right.
101
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,180
Those Chakra Threads are…
102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,300
connected to my heart’s
Chakra Network.
103
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,100
And Naruto, the thread that’s
wrapped around you
104
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,720
is connected through my Chakra Network
to your organs and to your heart.
105
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,760
See, can you hear that?
106
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,720
My heart and your heart will
eventually become connected as one!
107
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,800
– Damn! 					– Naruto!
108
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,590
It’s no use. That thread is formulated
and spun with Chakra
109
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,470
and it will absolutely not break.
110
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,140
Now our hearts are
completely synchronized…
111
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,260
The Chakra which passes
through this thread
112
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,590
via the Chakra Network from my heart
is controlling your heart ,you see.
113
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,590
It’s no use, even though
it’s my heart…
114
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,350
If my heart beat gets faster,
your heart will get faster too…
115
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,140
And when my heart stops beating…
116
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,010
you will die too!
117
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,510
Don’t! If you stop your heart,
you’ll die too!
118
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,050
That’s right.
But that doesn’t mean much.
119
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,760
Since I’ve already promised
my body to Lord Orochimaru…
120
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,590
Wh-What the heck are
you gonna do?!
121
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,010
If I crush this heart…
122
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,550
you will die too!
123
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,010
If I crush this heart…
124
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,720
you will die too!
125
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,590
Now, together we will…
126
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Naruto!
127
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,390
How’s it feel to have
your heart seized?
128
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,220
It’ll be all right…
129
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,390
You’ll be out of your misery
right away!
130
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,590
Stop it!
131
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,760
How foolish, if you kill me
Naruto will die too.
132
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,300
What I’m gonna cut…
133
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,970
is this!
134
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,590
There’s no use you know,
135
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,390
It’s impossible to cut thread formulated
and made from Chakra.
136
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,590
Even Lady Tsunade’s great strength
wouldn’t be able to break it.
137
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,470
What should I…
What should I do?!
138
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,100
Naruto is suffering right
in front of my eyes and yet…
139
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,140
I can’t do anything!
140
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,260
Sakura…!
141
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,590
I…absolutely will not lose!
142
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,590
Until I’ve fulfilled my promise!
143
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,590
You bravado ends there.
144
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,930
Now, shall we die together?
145
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,510
And go to the place where
Sasuke is waiting?
146
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,050
Naruto!
147
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,350
Sakura!
148
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
– Sasame?! 					– Sakura…
149
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,760
Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife!
150
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,260
Naruto!
151
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,470
Naruto!
152
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,590
Naruto?!
Hey, are you okay? Naruto!
153
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,390
No way…
154
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,590
It can’t be…
155
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,930
No way!
156
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,300
Naruto!
157
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,590
Ahh… My chest right now
is beating with joy.
158
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,180
Idiot! It was a waste for me
to have worried!
159
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,590
Sorry, Sakura…
160
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,760
You’re so worthless!
161
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,390
That’s right, Sasame!
Why are you here?
162
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,590
Well, it’s…
163
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,180
I was saved by Sasame,
you know.
164
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,590
Me too.
165
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,010
What do you mean?
166
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,640
Water came rushing into that
trap pit we were in earlier…
167
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,180
That’s it! The lid to the pit!
168
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,590
Damn!
169
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,590
When the water reached
the ceiling,
170
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,590
I desperately tried to open the lid,
but wasn’t able to escape…
171
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,300
I was told by Master Jiraiya
to go to where Hanzaki is.
172
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,850
But I got concerned about Arashi,
so I came…
173
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,430
Naruto!
174
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,760
Hey! Thanks!
175
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,100
Th-The frog spoke…!
176
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,430
Well, come to think of it,
177
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,010
there’s no way you could open the lid
of the trap by pushing on it.
178
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,430
Geez!
179
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,590
But how come the thread that
I couldn’t cut with the Kunai Knife,
180
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,590
be cut when I wrapped it
with Sasame’s tag?
181
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,930
Because the Chakra Thread
is a Secret Technique
182
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,590
within the secrets of
our Fuuma Ninja Technique…
183
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,470
Of the Fuuma?!
184
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,260
Oh I see…
So who the heck is this?!
185
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,590
Oh!
186
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,590
She is…from earlier!
187
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,970
Mistress Kagero…
188
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,590
She’s a Fuuma Jonin.
189
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,350
Sasame!
190
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,140
Sasame…
191
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,180
I was resurrected
by Lord Orochimaru…
192
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,590
You! You’re being tricked
by Orochimaru!
193
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,430
Where is Sasuke?
194
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,590
And Arashi?
Where’s Sasame’s cousin!
195
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,720
Lord Orochimaru is…
196
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,590
going to raise our Fuuma clan…
197
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,220
to the center stage
of Shinobi again.
198
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,590
You’re still talking about
that stuff?!
199
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,430
At least tell Sasame the truth!
200
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,390
So it’s there! He’s in there!
201
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,010
Sasame and Arashi…
You two were so close…
202
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,050
Then it’d be better
if you didn’t see him.
203
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,100
Mistress Kagero …
204
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,890
What do you want to do, Sasame?
205
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,470
Do you want to wait here?
206
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,600
I will see him!
No matter what’s in store for me!
207
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,220
I came all the way here
to see Arashi!
208
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,470
Yeah! You’ve got guts!
209
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,220
All right! Let’s go together!
210
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,590
Yeah! Let’s go!
211
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,930
Sasame…
212
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,760
There might be some sort of trap…
213
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,890
Leave it to me!
214
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Orochimaru?!
215
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,510
Good of you to come, Sasame…
216
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,760
Why…?
217
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,050
Arashi…!
218
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,300
Arashi!
219
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,890
Arashi?
220
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,010
I’m no longer…
221
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,590
Arashi…
222
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,590
Wh-What the heck is going on?!
223
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,470
The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Jonin
were combined into one…
224
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,220
and I’ve been reborn as
the ultimate Ninja you see…
225
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:05,720
Now, I’ll show you
my ultimate Ninjutsu…Sasame!
226
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,180
No… Arashi…
227
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,550
Damn, Orochimaru!
228
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,260
I will not forgive him,
no matter what!
229
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,180
When I recalled the parts one by one,
230
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,590
I felt as though
I had understood everything
231
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:46,100
Faded words which I kept so close to me
232
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:55,800
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
and
233
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,590
and this distant yearning for you
234
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:11,930
I live, simply repeating this cycle
235
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:23,590
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
236
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:34,100
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
237
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,760
I’ll keep these thoughts…
238
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,590
Sorry… I’m sorry, Naruto.
239
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,600
I haven’t been able to do anything,
after all.
240
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,590
I’m always dragging you down.
I hadn’t changed at all.
241
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,590
But Naruto, Sasame,
you two taught me.
242
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,930
That’s why I want to change
the kind of person I am!
243
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,510
This time, this time,
it’s my turn to give it my all!
244
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,590
Next time, “Sakura's Determination!”
//%
1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,820
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,570
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,360
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,690
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,700
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,150
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,610
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,110
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,570
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,570
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,780
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,450
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,280
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,900
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,360
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,530
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,950
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,490
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,690
The Three Villains from
the Maximum Security Prison
21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,690
All right!
22
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,690
I can start my training!
23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,400
Right now, this is all I can do.
I can’t allow myself to fail!
24
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,400
What’s up?
25
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,200
Going to all the trouble of coming
to pick me up like this…
26
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,610
You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’s
after this anyway, right…?
27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,690
Taking the time to converse
once in a while…
28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,690
that’s also part of teamwork.
29
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,690
Let me hear about your mission.
30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,860
It was pretty incredible…
31
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,700
But you wouldn’t understand
even if I explained it to you.
32
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,360
I don’t want Akamaru to experience
that kind of thing ever again.
33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,690
And for that reason, I must polish
my Jutsu all the more…
34
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,860
I want to hear about it in detail.
35
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,690
Because that’s what teamwork
is about.
36
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,740
Are you sulking
37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,490
‘cause you were the only one
who was passed up?
38
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,700
You are sulking, aren’t you?
39
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,650
There have to be more further up…
40
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,200
Until I can see it…
41
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,610
I can’t believe you’re doing
that from the morning…
42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,950
Neji, let’s take a break.
43
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,780
Okay!
44
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,900
– Let’s go, Hinata! 					– Okay!
45
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,530
Father, see you later.
46
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,200
Barbecued meat?
This early in the morning, huh?
47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,650
Just when he was looking good
after losing some weight
48
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,320
when he was released
from the hospital.
49
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,110
He made an amazing rebound,
didn’t he?
50
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,690
With that good an appetite,
51
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,150
there aren’t any more worries
about his health, are there?
52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,570
When I’m done eating,
help me with my training, okay?
53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,860
Asuma Sensei!
54
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,030
Hey, are you an idiot
or something?!
55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,070
You’re recuperating, you know!
56
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,400
L-Lee… Come on,
let’s take a short break…
57
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,200
What’s the matter, Guy Sensei?
58
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,650
The prime of one’s youth waits
for no one, you know.
59
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,820
Maintaining the prime of one’s youth
is starting to get tough…
60
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,690
Thank you very much!
61
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,740
Do your best, guys…
62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,950
I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu by
the next time you’re here!
63
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,150
M-Me too…
64
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,690
I want to become a Kunoichi
just like you, Temari…
65
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,240
I’m honored.
66
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,690
I apologize for asking you
to teach at the Academy…
67
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,990
since we’re so short-staffed right now.
68
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,530
You probably would've preferred
to go sightseeing or something.
69
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,530
No problem.
I’m doing this because I enjoy it.
70
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,150
Yeah… And we were also able to survey
71
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,070
the future potential of
the Leaf’s military power…
72
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,690
Well, be careful going home.
73
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,650
Okay…
74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,070
If something happens again,
I’ll come to your rescue again.
75
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,610
Just let me know, crybaby.
76
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,780
You always say too much.
That’s why girls are…
77
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,400
Let’s kick butt again today, Akamaru!
78
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,650
All right, everybody’s here right?
79
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,320
You don’t need to be so tense, Hinata…
80
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,780
Y-Yeah…
81
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,740
All right! Everybody stand ready!
82
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,950
I can’t…lose to Naruto…!
83
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,320
All right! I’m ready!
84
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,700
I just have to wait
for Pervy Sage to come--!
85
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,700
There he is!
86
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,780
But my training…
87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Don’t get so pouty, Naruto.
88
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,530
Some work came in all of a sudden.
lt can’t be helped.
89
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,490
It’s just gonna be doing
an interview
90
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,110
for some obscene magazine
anyway, right?
91
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,690
That kind of thing isn’t called work.
92
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,200
It’s a mission to gather information
about the Akatsuki Organization.
93
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,690
But if I tell this guy that,
94
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,320
he might ask me to
let him come.
95
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,360
Humph!
96
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,950
I’ll make it up to you by…
97
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,070
Huh?
98
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,030
W-What’s this?
99
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,690
It’s so that you don’t get bored
while you’re staying at home,
100
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,320
it’s a special training menu
I put together!
101
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,700
Wow!
102
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,450
Wait, wait!
103
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,530
My own prized secret training
methods are inscribed here.
104
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,030
Don’t read this where
other people might see it!
105
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,070
Okay!
106
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,490
Well, do your best!
107
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,070
I’m gonna use this
to train vigorously!
108
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,530
Thank you, Pervy Sage!
109
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,070
The walls have ears…
paper doors have eyes…
110
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,490
Pervy Sage’s secret training methods…
111
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,320
WILLPOWER
112
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,700
What?!
113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,900
Pervy Sage!
114
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,780
Since I have been entrusted
115
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,690
with the great Village Hidden
in the Leaves that you built,
116
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,690
no matter what danger might strike,
it is my duty to protect it.
117
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,280
The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
118
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,570
Yes, you really do.
119
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,030
Is that you, Shizune?
Enter!
120
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,400
All of these reports regarding
the village’s internal affairs accumulated
121
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,690
because so many things
were happening in the Leaf Village.
122
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,900
I guess the only thing to do
is start at the top.
123
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,990
Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
124
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,110
Did its name change?
125
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,650
Yes, in the past
it was called
126
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,400
Prison Specializing in
Capital Offenses Ninja.
127
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,690
Fortunately, because there
is a downward trend
128
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,950
in felonies committed by Shinobi,
129
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,900
along with the downsizing of the facility,
the name was changed as well.
130
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,530
Incarcerated are murderers,
131
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,360
those who were involved in
leaking classified secrets, and so on.
132
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,030
They are all criminal Ninja…
133
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,360
There haven’t been any noticeable
disruptions in the past few years
134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,690
and the facility has been
relatively stable.
135
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,070
– Food! 					– Food!
136
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,860
It’s finally time to eat,
isn’t it, Elder Brother!
137
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,690
Yeah! I’m so excited!
138
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,690
Hey! Fujin! Raijin!
139
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,240
If you don’t shut up,
you’re gonna go without dinner!
140
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,820
Gimme a break! Those guys…
141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,690
You may pass!
142
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,700
Hey! Wait!
143
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,690
You’re hurt, aren’t you?
144
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,690
Go to the dispensary later
and have that looked at.
145
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,030
Okay…
146
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,650
All right, next!
147
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,990
H-Hey, Elder Brother…
148
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Huh?
149
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:46,280
Why is the little finger
short and weak?
150
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,690
That’s easy, Raijin.
151
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,240
If the little finger was thick and strong,
152
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,030
then your thumb would
have no leg to stand on.
153
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,690
I-I see!
154
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,900
Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!
155
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,900
– Huh? 					– A lizard!
156
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,690
Raijin, you’ve always been
a dandy one from way back.
157
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,690
W-We haven’t had enough to eat,
have we, Elder Brother?
158
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,860
Yeah…
159
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,780
Not asking permission again…
160
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,030
What’s the matter?
161
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,400
What’s up this time?
162
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,690
I’m starving…
163
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,690
G-Give us something to eat!
164
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,200
Oh no… If these guys find out
I don’t have anything…!
165
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,700
Um…right now…
166
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,780
Don’t tell me that
you don’t have even one offering…
167
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,740
to these Fujin and
Raijin brothers?!
168
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,400
Well…wait…wait…!
169
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,650
What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
170
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,860
I’ll bring you something else later!
171
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,690
Right now make do with that!
172
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,950
– Okay! 					– Okay!
173
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,550
Are you okay?
174
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,300
Those guys are quiet
when they have food.
175
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,390
But if they get angry
they’re out of control.
176
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,100
Yeah…They annihilated all their comrades
over food during a mission
177
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,800
and the people around just barely
managed to hold them down.
178
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,590
Something smells good?!
179
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,590
Yeah.
180
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,590
This way!
181
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,930
– Food! Food! Food!
– Food! Food! Food!
182
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,470
I just can’t get to liking clerical work.
183
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
There’s still a whole lot more to do,
Lady Tsunade.
184
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,850
I wonder what this is?
185
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,760
It looks like a formula
for some kind of medicine…
186
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,470
A formula…
187
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,180
Send an available Jonin here
immediately!
188
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,850
Yes, ma’am?
189
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,260
Hurry!
190
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,470
Y-Yes, ma’am!
191
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,140
How about it…
Does it taste good?
192
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,590
I see…I see…
There’s still a whole lot more.
193
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,390
Just as I thought,
194
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,390
that good smell was coming
from your place, Elder Brother!
195
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,930
Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brother
always has delicious food!
196
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,930
It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?
197
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,590
’Cause I’d feel so sorry
if you guys had to go hungry.
198
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,720
Elder Brother…
199
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,390
– A lizard! 					– A lizard!
200
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,600
I see, I see…Happy?
201
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,180
How about it, you guys?
202
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,550
Don’t you want to eat things
that are even more delicious?
203
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,350
W-Where are they at?!
204
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,100
If we go to the place where
an old friend of mine is…
205
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,800
you can pig out on food
that’s even more delicious than here.
206
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,590
Is that the guy you told us
about long time ago, Elder Brother?
207
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,140
Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…
208
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,800
Gimme a break…
that guy’s gotta be kidding!
209
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,300
That Pervy Sage…
210
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,890
just leaving me and
my training up in the air!
211
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,180
Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.
212
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
213
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,600
Heh!
214
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,590
It’s probably that
Lady Tsunade decided
215
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,140
that only Master Jiraiya
could do the job…
216
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,590
It can't be helped.
217
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,680
Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’s
doing, after all, huh!
218
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,800
Well, I guess all I can do is treat you
to some ramen noodles like this.
219
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,260
So cheer up.
220
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,350
I’m gonna go complain
to Old Lady Tsunade!
221
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,350
Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
222
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,590
N-Naruto!
223
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,760
Damn… another annoying situation.
224
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,590
Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
225
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,390
This is about a year ago,
226
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,590
a Chunin Academy staff member
used Naruto
227
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,850
to sneak out
the Scroll of Sealing.
228
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,640
According to the report, it was
a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
229
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,220
The crime was solved, but…?
230
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,470
Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
231
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:47,590
The possibility has arisen that
a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
232
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,220
This is a clue…
233
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,140
This is something that Mizuki
was concealing
234
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,930
when he was incarcerated
in the Maximum Security Facility.
235
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,890
At the time, nobody thought of it
as anything more than a doodle.
236
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,600
Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
237
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,220
I don’t know, however…
238
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,590
The handwriting resembles
the document confiscated from the facility
239
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,590
where Orochimaru was conducting
human experiments…
240
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,590
Which means that…
Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
241
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,800
The possibility of that is not zero.
242
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,890
It’s not like a Chunin alone could do
anything with the Scroll of Sealing.
243
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,300
It would only make sense if Orochimaru
were pulling strings from behind.
244
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,930
Asuma! Kurenai!
245
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,180
Go immediately to the Maximum
Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
246
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,890
Orochimaru?!
247
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,590
Be careful! Something’s strange here!
248
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,850
Yeah… It’s too quiet.
249
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,390
Let’s go!
250
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,720
Oh, how touching.
A welome party for us…
251
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,590
Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome.
Right, Elder Brother?
252
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah…
253
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,390
Asuma, don’t tell me that
those guys are…
254
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,140
Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…
255
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,590
Fujin and Raijin!
256
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,180
Asuma…
257
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,590
Hey, you guys are whooping it up
too much for a welcome party!
258
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,430
Hey, calm down…
the welcome party’s just started.
259
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,180
His character has changed completely…
260
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,180
All you jerks…
261
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,640
You will…be our offering!
262
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,930
Do it!
263
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,590
Orochimaru!
264
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,180
Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
265
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,720
Crappy news pass us by
266
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,300
And you become speechless
267
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,300
My voice is way too soft
268
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,590
So you don’t answer
269
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,220
You’re crying   Crying alone
270
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,050
What can I do?   I’m crying too
271
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,590
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
272
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:07,760
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
273
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:17,510
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
274
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:26,590
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
275
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:38,470
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
276
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,850
What’s the matter, Ton Ton?
277
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,590
What in the world happened?
278
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,390
Say, weren't you together
with Shizune?
279
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,180
Don't tell me something's
happened to her?
280
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,760
I don't know what happened,
but take me there, Ton Ton!
281
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,600
I'm getting a bad feeling about this!
282
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,300
Next episode,

Hit it straight like a line drive!

Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,310
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,150
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,440
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:51,810
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,100
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,690
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

20
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,230
Okay! Let’s go!
21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,350
Huh?
22
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,230
"Let's go,"
with so much energy…
23
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,520
Don't act like a little kid!
24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh? You’re in a bad mood.
25
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,690
Because! Because!
lt's in the middle of my training!
26
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,890
There are three steps
in the training, right?!
27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,650
I’m only done with the second step!
28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,190
You can do the third step
even while walking.
29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,190
What! Really?!
30
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,650
A balloon?
31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,890
Here!
32
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,890
What’s this…?
An ordinary balloon?
33
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,900
The first step is “Spin.”
The second step is “Power.”
34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,310
And finally, the third step is this.
35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,190
An Impossible Choice:
The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart
36
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,520
Which one is “this”?!
37
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,770
Watch me, it looks as if
I am simply holding a balloon…
38
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,310
You say it “looks as if,”
but nothing is really happening.
39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Then, I will do the same thing
on my left hand.
40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,850
Let’s see what’s really happening
inside the balloon.
41
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,900
Wow!
42
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,890
The Chakra is randomly spinning
and going faster and faster…
43
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,560
But still, it’s perfectly round…
lt’s almost like…
44
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,270
Like a small typhoon, right?
45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,980
What’s happening in your left hand…
46
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,560
is happening inside that balloon
in your right hand, too?
47
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,890
Yeah! That’s right.
48
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,020
Cool…
49
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,650
The balloon isn’t moving at all
even if he’s spinning that much Chakra…
50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,100
There’s more power than
that time the rubber ball popped,
51
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,100
and it’s spinning a lot more too!
52
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,940
Listen, in this third step,
53
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,890
you’ve got to use 100% of
what you have learned…
54
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,690
and retain them.
55
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,980
In other words, while keeping
the “Spin” and the “Power” at their max,
56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,890
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon
57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,890
and compressing the Chakra within it.
58
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,850
Got it!
59
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,890
So, this training is about keeping
60
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,060
the spin and power that I did
in the second step,
61
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,100
and conversely,
trying not to pop a delicate balloon!
62
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,770
Oh! That’s the most perceptive
you've been so far!
63
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,100
Huh?
64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,690
But, what’s the point in going
to all the trouble?!
65
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,100
In short, it means this.
66
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,890
Watch! It’s like this up until
the second step of the training.
67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,100
Next, after you have mastered
the third step!
68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,650
This is what happens!
69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,440
If you can keep this small typhoon
the size of your palm,
70
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,940
the force won’t disperse.
71
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,600
The spinning gets faster and faster
72
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,690
and the power gets
more and more compressed.
73
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,770
And the destructive power
will reach its max.
74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,150
Well, so, that’s that.
75
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,650
All right! I’ll do this, too!
76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,600
Okay, this feels right…
77
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,600
Now!
78
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,060
Retain it here!
79
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,890
Retain…
80
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,230
Retain…
81
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,060
No cutting-corners!
82
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,230
You’ve got to put out 100% spin and power,
and retain them.
83
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,890
You gotta be kidding…
84
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,480
Unless I can perfectly control all my power,
it’s impossible!
85
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,400
Now I can see it…
86
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,770
This third step…
87
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,850
It’s on a totally different level
compared to the others.
88
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,440
I told you…
89
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,890
With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,
it’s a super advanced Ninjutsu.
90
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,020
Well, I’m done explaining!
We’ll continue as we go on walking.
91
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,310
Hey, hey!
92
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,560
We don’t need to rush so much,
until I can properly…
93
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,440
We have already wasted enough time
waiting for your body to recover.
94
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,890
There’s no guarantee that
Tsunade stays in this town much longer.
95
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,600
What?!
96
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,900
But, but…
97
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,890
It’s not like an old acquaintance
is going to conveniently pop up
98
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,770
and start talking about
the good old times with her…
99
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,440
Come on, let’s go!
100
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,190
All right…
101
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,270
Long time no see…Orochimaru.
102
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,650
I’d looked for you everywhere.
103
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,150
What do you want from me
after so long a time?
104
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,650
You aren’t thinking of talking
about the old days…?
105
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,650
Actually, I need to ask you
for a little favor…
106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,770
His heartbeat is fast…
107
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,400
From that complexion,
he must have a high fever.
108
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,520
He must have been fatigued
for quite some time…
109
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,650
And that arm…
110
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,770
Lady Tsunade.
111
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,520
You must have understood by now.
112
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,890
Go to someone else,
I don’t treat anyone any more.
113
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,770
That won’t do…
114
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,440
You must know how serious
this wound is…
115
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,400
No one can treat this wound.
116
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,440
Except for one of the Legendary “Sannin”
117
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
who won her fame as
a medical specialist, Princess Tsunade…
118
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,810
You…
119
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,890
That arm…
it’s not an ordinary wound.
120
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,600
A special Sealing Jutsu or something…?
121
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,350
What have you done?
122
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,890
Well, it just happened…
when I killed the Third Hokage.
123
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,890
You… Really?
124
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,150
Humph. Don’t look so scary.
125
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,060
Anything that has a form
will one day decay…
126
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,520
Same goes for humans.
127
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,890
You must already know that too.
128
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:58,890
For you have let two of
your most beloved ones die…
129
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,060
Let two of the most beloved ones die?
130
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,560
I see… He thinks of terrible things.
131
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,020
That was a really terrible way to die…
132
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,310
You!
133
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,890
Poisoned…
134
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,480
She’s fast!
135
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,650
Get out of my way!
136
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,940
Won’t let you!
137
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,770
Calm down, Shizune!
138
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,440
This attendant…is an expert.
139
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,850
Orochimaru…
140
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,810
Your personality's been like this
for a long time.
141
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,520
And you know my personality
very well…
142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,730
So stop fooling around with me.
143
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,890
I’ll kill you, bastard!
144
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,480
She’s powerful…
145
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,850
And so scary…
she definitely must be single.
146
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,520
Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered…
147
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,850
Hey Naruto,
there’s no time to be falling.
148
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,480
If we don’t hurry,
149
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
who knows where that shrew
will disappear again.
150
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,730
Hey you, Pervy Sage!
151
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,560
That’s no way to speak to
a hard-working apprentice!
152
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,600
Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now,
not you.
153
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,600
Well, what the heck!
154
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,810
To have this Pervy Sage come
all the way to meet her…
155
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,440
Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?
156
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,060
Hope she’s still here…
157
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,810
We didn’t come here to fight.
158
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,350
We just want to negotiate with you!
159
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Negotiate?
160
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,190
Yes.
161
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,650
Don’t make me laugh!
162
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,890
I’ve already told you once.
Get out of my sight!
163
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,060
We can’t do that.
164
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,400
Get out of my sight.
165
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,890
You are the only one
who can treat Lord Orochimaru’s arm.
166
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,600
Get out of my sight.
167
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,020
We’re not asking you to do it for free.
168
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,650
Let’s make a deal!
169
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,730
I’ll count up to five.
Leave before I’m done.
170
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,270
Or else, I’ll make you disappear myself.
171
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,770
Please calm down.
lt won’t be a bad deal for you…
172
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,650
Five…
173
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,440
Four…
174
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,770
Three…
175
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,020
Two…
176
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,810
One…
177
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,770
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…
178
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,400
with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
179
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,730
Since we haven’t disappeared yet,
180
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,190
I’m guessing that the deal is made?
181
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,900
Yes. I do know this young lady…
182
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,060
Really?
183
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,350
Yeah.
184
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,890
To win back the money she lost here,
I think she said…
185
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,980
she was going over there.
186
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,440
Spin… Power…
187
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,350
Letting them out to their max
and retain it…
188
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,310
Hey, kid.
189
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,600
Hmm?
190
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,100
Wanna gamble a bit, too?
191
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,230
Over there? Where is that?
192
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,600
Hmm?
193
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,690
See, if the total number of the pips
on these dices
194
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,230
comes out as even numbers,
that’s “Cho”
195
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,890
and if it’s odd, that’s “Han.”
196
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,520
Shut up! I am training right now,
don’t bug me!
197
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,150
What nonsense!
This is a gambling house.
198
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,600
Instead of that balloon,
let’s play with these.
199
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,890
No way! I don’t have any time
to be playing with those dice!
200
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,890
Ha, what a boring kid!
201
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,980
Shut up!
202
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,520
So…can you tell me where that is?
203
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,690
Well, you can’t expect things to be free
in a gambling house, you know?
204
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,940
Okay…
205
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,400
Let’s make a deal.
The information will be free if you win…
206
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,440
And if you lose,
I’ll give it to you for 1000 ryo.
207
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
All right!
208
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
So choose, odd or even!
209
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,770
Okay! Here we go…
210
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,650
Well, so…
since I am exactly 50 years old.
211
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,890
I’ll go for…even!
212
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,850
If it’s odd, I win…
213
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,770
I’ll open it now.
214
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,230
Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!
215
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,980
W-What the heck--?!
216
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,890
1000 ryo…
217
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,890
Nice, Naruto!
218
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,270
Looks like I won…
219
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,890
Darn! It didn’t work again!
220
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,980
Retain…
221
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,890
Where shall I look next?
222
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,600
Geez, she’s nowhere to be found!
223
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,770
Hm? Me?
224
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,440
Lotto?
225
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,560
Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.
226
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,890
Come and play with
this fun, fun Lotto.
227
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,020
There’s one that you know
the result right away.
228
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,020
Which one do you want?
229
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,890
Really, you are so much cuter
being chubby!
230
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,730
I can’t believe he won
with just one draw.
231
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,900
He’s very talented in this…
232
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,650
though his talent in Jutsu
is still immature.
233
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,890
Well…anyhow…
234
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,690
Where could have Tsunade gone?
235
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,980
She couldn’t have gone that far
in this short amount of time.
236
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,980
I guess we’ll have to
search for her from a higher place.
237
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,890
If I remember it correctly,
this is a castle town.
238
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,600
If we go up to the castle…
239
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,940
Naruto! This way!
240
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,150
Don’t you want to see those two…
Tsunade?
241
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,890
Nawaki…Dan…
242
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,440
If I treat your arms,
what do you intend to do with them?
243
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,690
Well, I don’t like to lie…
244
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,890
So, I will tell you the truth.
245
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,150
Hey, hey! Where is the castle?
246
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,600
It’s not there…?
247
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,520
In addition to getting what I want…
248
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,560
This time, I will completely destroy
the Leaf Village!
249
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,890
A cycle of hardship, right?
250
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,850
Inside, we were crying, right?
251
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:39,940
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
252
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,020
It's a secondary role,
253
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,890
a role in the shadows
254
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,230
But in reaching for that dream,
255
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,890
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
256
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,900
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
257
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,890
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
258
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:19,150
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
259
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,560
Over and over,
we've seen fools
260
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,310
Hey, enough already!
261
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,900
Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!
262
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,730
Who cares if she is
the legendary Kunoichi?!
263
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,520
Who cares if she's
the medical specialist?!
264
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,560
There's no way I'll accept
this person as the new Hokage!
265
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,890
If she belittles the Third
and Fourth Hokages…
266
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,350
I don't care if she's the candidate
to be the Fifth Hokage!
267
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,890
I'll kick her butt!
268
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,250
Next time:
"Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!"
//%
1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,730
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:17,980
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,280
One more time
4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,980
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,230
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,900
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:45,530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,770
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,770
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,820
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,980
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,820
One more time
15
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,480
Your destiny is to lose to me.
For sure.
16
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,820
You don’t know until you try!
17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,530
Your father was killed a long time ago
18
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,070
and I don’t know the extent
of the pain you’ve felt…
19
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,280
But it’s a huge mistake for you to think
that has determined your entire destiny!
20
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,440
You’re hopeless…
21
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,770
Proctor…it’s over.
22
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,190
You failure…
23
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:22,570
A Failure's True Power
24
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,360
Don’t…run away.
25
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,770
I won’t…run…
26
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,190
I’ll…stand by my own words…
27
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,820
That’s my Ninja Way!
28
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,770
I’ll…
29
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,280
stand…
30
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,190
by my own…
31
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
words!
32
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,770
That’s my…Ninja Way…
33
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,770
I think I’ve heard that line before…
34
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,690
You with your destiny stuff…
35
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,940
I won’t lose…
36
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,110
to a jerk with cold feet like you,
no matter what!
37
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,070
Naruto…
38
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,690
A brat who knows nothing
shouldn’t lecture arrogantly!
39
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,400
People are born burdened with
an inherent destiny that they cannot defy.
40
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,360
Neji…live…
41
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,940
You’re a man who is blessed
with Hyuga ability
42
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,770
more than anyone in the family…
43
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,110
I wanted you…to be born
into the head family…
44
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,570
You can’t possibly understand
45
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,770
the destiny of being burdened with
a mark that cannot be wiped off for life!
46
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,190
Yeah…
47
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,940
I do understand it.
48
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,440
So…what of it?
49
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,770
This brat!
50
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,440
Don’t be acting cool…
51
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,650
It’s not just you who’s special!
52
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,400
Hinata was also…
suffering the same as you!
53
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,480
Even though she’s the head family,
not being acknowledged as such…
54
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,110
trying desperately to change herself…
55
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,690
She fought you while coughing
up blood with that in mind!
56
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,530
You too!
57
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,690
The branch family that
protects the head family…
58
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,030
Doing all that to Hinata
just because it’s an exam.
59
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,770
In actuality, you were just as frantic
60
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,360
in attempting to go
against destiny, right?
61
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,610
Vitality has returned to Hinata’s face!
62
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,770
Just what I’d expect of
the Anbu Black Ops…
63
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,770
She'll be okay.
64
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,730
Now she needs bed rest.
65
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,940
Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut…
66
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,030
How are you, who can’t use Chakra
for awhile, planning to fight?
67
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,980
At the end of the day,
68
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,570
you and Miss Hinata have
the same destiny!
69
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,770
Shut up!
70
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,030
With your Byakugan, labeling people
and talking like you understand!
71
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,820
Then…show me whether what
you’re saying is true or not.
72
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,770
I will! I’ll defeat you no matter
what and prove that to you!
73
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,110
Dang it… Dang it!
74
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,230
That being said, I don’t feel Chakra at all.
75
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,190
It feels like when I used up
my Chakra in the training.
76
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,690
You possess two kinds of Chakra…
77
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,610
You must extract and utilize, at any time,
78
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,570
the other huge Chakra that
has rested inside you from the start…
79
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,070
That’s it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…
I’ll use that…
80
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,570
Stinking fox… 					Help me out!
81
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,230
This is as far as the talking goes.
82
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,360
Proctor… I’m going to fight with
the intent to kill him!
83
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,770
If you’re going to stop me,
please feel free.
84
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,900
Jeez.
85
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,820
Didn’t I tell you it is pointless?
86
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,440
This time, I really can’t lose!
87
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,770
I’ll win no matter what!
88
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,150
It’s futile…I pressed the Chakra Points…
89
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,280
No matter what…
90
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,780
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come
watch me kick that Neji’s butt!
91
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,900
A failure beats down
a genius with effort…
92
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,820
His opponent might be me…
93
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,440
But even if that’s you, Naruto,
no hard feelings.
94
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,730
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?
95
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,110
Because I was called…
96
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,770
a failure!
97
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,440
No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.
98
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,280
What’s the meaning of this…?
99
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,770
H-He…! 					What in the world…?!
100
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,110
W-What is he…?!
101
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,030
It can’t be… This Chakra!
102
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,770
T-That’s…impossible!
103
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,570
No way! His Chakra Points
have been pressed!
104
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,900
This Chakra…
lt’s the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt…
105
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
When did he master
the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…?!
106
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,650
Here I go!
107
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,980
It’s twisting…
108
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,190
What’s that?!
ls that even Chakra?!
109
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,780
Awesome power.
More so than during the training…
110
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,150
I feel it!
111
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,770
Rotation!
112
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,030
What?!
113
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,900
His speed’s gone up!
What in the world is going on?!
114
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,690
You!
115
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,610
You’re confident in close combat, right?!
116
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,530
You’re going to become the Hokage…?
117
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,400
I don’t… think so.
118
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,360
Only a very small percentage of
Ninja are chosen to be the Hokage!
119
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,770
Look more at reality!
120
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,650
Those who become the Hokage
are born with destiny.
121
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,770
It’s not something you become
by trying to become it.
122
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,780
It’s determined by destiny.
123
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,770
People must live within
their different respective currents
124
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,280
that can’t be gone against.
125
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,730
I don’t know what the
Hyuga destiny of hatred is!
126
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,770
But if you’re going to say it’s futile,
you don’t have to do anything!
127
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,610
This is bad! I must use the Rotation!
128
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,570
After I become the Hokage…
129
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,690
I’ll change Hyuga!
130
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,770
What Chakra…
131
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,770
That kid showed some enormous strength…
132
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,570
The Hyuga kid is probably…
133
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,110
Say! Which one’s Naruto?!
134
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,360
I don’t know, either!
135
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,770
Neji’s Rotation is a technique
where the body rotates,
136
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,190
and dodges and
repels the opponent’s Chakra!
137
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,030
It looks like there was
more damage done to Naruto
138
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,820
since he plunged right into the Rotation.
139
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,780
There’s no Genin that can beat Neji…
140
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,030
But Naruto, you’re incredible…
141
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,770
To think you’d force him this far…
142
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,690
Failure boy…
Sorry, but this is the reality…
143
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,360
Now this is really the en…
144
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,150
My body…
145
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,230
So he left a Shadow clone in the hole
and spotted a chance to win, huh…
146
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,770
Believing in victory,
thinking about what’s next
147
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,770
and acting even when getting
knocked around, huh…
148
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,770
The power of believing in oneself.
149
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,650
That becomes the power
to change destiny…
150
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,730
He knows this…
And he’s a natural to boot.
151
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,730
In those conditions,
152
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,190
you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu
just like that…
153
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,770
The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?
154
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,770
I was careless…
155
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,320
I’ve…failed the graduation
exam three times…
156
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,860
As luck would have it,
157
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,070
the Ninjutsu tests that appeared
on the graduation exam were always…
158
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,230
infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
159
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,360
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu…
I stunk at.
160
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,820
Don’t be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,
161
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,770
and how it can’t be changed!
162
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,030
Because unlike me…
you’re not a failure.
163
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,360
Winner of this match is Naruto Uzumaki.
164
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,570
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
165
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,820
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
166
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,440
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
167
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,770
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
168
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:46,110
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
169
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
170
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,320
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
171
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,770
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
172
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,980
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
173
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,400
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
174
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,690
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
175
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,940
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
176
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:37,610
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
177
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:44,770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
178
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,190
Yahoo! I've won! I've won!
179
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,530
Hey Naruto…
180
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,900
Don't you think I was so cool?!
181
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,440
Don't get so carried away!
182
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,690
Sakura…?
183
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,820
Sasuke hasn't arrived here yet.
184
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,770
What's up with that kid,
making Sakura worry so much?
185
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,770
Nex time, "Hit it or Quit it:
The Final Rounds Get Complicated!"
//%
1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,740
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,990
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,280
One more time
4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,990
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,240
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,940
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,780
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:02,940
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,940
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:17,990
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,940
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,940
One more time
15
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,940
Assassin of the Moonlit Night
16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,570
T-This guy…
17
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,940
Sasuke!
18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,940
So we were too late…
19
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,490
Those guys…
20
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,320
Sa…Sakura…?
21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,400
You guys…
22
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,700
T-This…
23
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,400
He probably fought recklessly…
24
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,280
like that time!
25
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,650
Sasuke!
26
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,900
Kakashi Sensei said there was nothing
to worry about with the bruise!
27
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,110
So tell me…Sakura…
28
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,240
Sakura!
29
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,990
What do you want?!
30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,940
This guy… Who is he?!
31
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,400
His outward appearance
is different, but…
32
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,610
he’s that guy called Gaara.
33
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,700
When I came into this world, I took the life
of the woman some might call my mother.
34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,700
So that I could become
the strongest Shinobi…
35
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,280
my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,610
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.
37
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,030
I was born a monster.
38
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,110
So that's what he was saying…
39
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,200
He’s the one who hurt Sasuke…
40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,740
Hey young girl!
41
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,860
I want you to know that
I’m not the fighting type!
42
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,610
I can see that by looking at you!
43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,940
In any case,
I need to get away from here
44
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,400
and somehow take Sasuke to
where Kakashi Sensei is!
45
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,940
You…
46
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,650
Sasuke…!
47
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,940
Well! Your limit is two shots…
48
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,200
That’s about it…
49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,780
The third shot won’t be activated…
Remember this well.
50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,780
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
51
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,200
not only will the Jutsu
not properly activate,
52
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,320
but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
53
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,280
and in the worst case, you’ll die!
54
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,110
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.
55
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,240
Especially in your case…
56
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,780
Is it the Curse Mark…?
57
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,940
If you let your hatred take over you,
58
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,320
and rely on the power
of the Curse Mark…
59
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,150
your development will stop there.
60
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,360
If that happens, you won’t
be able to beat Itachi.
61
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,400
In any case,
I need to get control over this.
62
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,940
Sasuke!
63
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
I see you’re…
64
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,400
the one I failed to kill that time.
65
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,450
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself…
66
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,990
And as long as there are others to kill…
67
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,490
I will never disappear.
68
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,940
L-Let’s run! Everyone!
69
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,650
Die! Sasuke Uchiha!
70
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,320
Sakura!
71
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,240
Out of the way!
72
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,940
Sakura!
73
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,070
How could she stand
in the way of that Gaara…?
74
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,200
Darn! Darn!
What the heck should we do?!
75
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,530
Just with him, I don’t want to…
76
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,650
Now, let me feel it!
77
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,320
Why…?
78
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,490
Gaara, Please calm down.
79
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,940
It’s no use after all…
80
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,610
The sand gets in the way.
81
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,280
Gaara…
82
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,570
Yashamaru!
83
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,490
I may not look it,
84
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,360
but Lord Kazekage charged me
to look after your physical condition
85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,940
as a member of medical corps
and to be with you.
86
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,400
Please do not do such things
in front of me.
87
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,030
Although the sand will protect you…
88
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,940
Yashamaru… I’m sorry…
89
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,940
Oh, this..? It’s just a scrape.
90
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,940
A scrape…
91
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,150
Is it painful?
92
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,860
A little bit… But it’ll heal in no time.
93
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,940
Hey Yashamaru…
94
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,200
What is it?
95
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,650
What is pain?
96
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,940
I’ve…never once had a wound so…
97
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,150
I wondered what it’s like…
98
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,940
Well…
99
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,610
How can I explain it?
100
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,700
It’s like it’s distressing, or difficult…
101
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,450
In other words, to be hit or cut…
102
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,780
Maybe I should say it’s a feeling
of not being able to bear it,
103
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,530
of not being able to stay normal…
104
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,320
I can’t say it well,
105
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,900
but I suppose it means a situation
that’s not very good.
106
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,700
Yashamaru…
107
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Yes?
108
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,200
So, do you dislike me…Yashamaru?
109
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,200
People live their lives while
hurting others and while being hurt.
110
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,530
But it’s not so easy for
people to dislike others.
111
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,780
Thank you, Yashamaru.
112
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,570
I think I sort of understand
what pain is now.
113
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,940
I see…
114
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,320
So…maybe I’m injured too?
The same as everyone?
115
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,610
I'm always…in pain.
116
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,700
I’m not bleeding, but…
117
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,490
I’ve been having a lot of
pain around…here.
118
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Blood does flow from a wound
on the body
119
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,900
and the wound may appear painful.
120
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,530
But as time passes, the pain
naturally disappears.
121
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,240
By using medicine,
the healing is even faster.
122
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,610
But what’s dangerous is
a wound of the heart.
123
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,280
Nothing has more trouble healing.
124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,780
A wound of the heart?
125
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,240
A wound on the body and
a wound of the heart are slightly different.
126
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,570
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,
127
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,780
it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.
128
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,780
But there is one thing that
can cure a wound of the heart.
129
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,940
However, this is a complicated medicine.
130
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,820
It can only be given to you
by another person.
131
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,110
What? What must I do to…?
132
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,570
The thing that can cure
a wound of the heart.
133
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,280
That is…
134
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,570
love.
135
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,530
Love?
136
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,700
Yes.
137
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,490
H-How can I get it?
What do I need to do for this pain to be…?
138
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,400
It has already been given to you, Gaara.
139
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,700
Huh?
140
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,200
Love is…a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,
141
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,940
to love and watch over that person,
just like my older sister did.
142
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,360
I believe that my older sister
loved you, Gaara.
143
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,940
Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a living
person used for the purpose of attacks.
144
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,940
The sand which automatically tries to
protect you is like the love of a mother.
145
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,320
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother’s will.
146
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,780
My sister…probably wanted to
protect you even more after dying…
147
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,110
Yashamaru…
148
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,950
What is it?
149
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,030
Thanks for what you did earlier…
for stopping me.
150
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,200
You are welcome.
151
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,650
You are a precious person
who is near me, Gaara!
152
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,780
Can you understand…my pain?
153
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,940
It tastes like iron…
154
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,570
Twenty!
155
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,490
Twenty-one!
156
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,530
Leaf…Hurricane!
157
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,940
How many did you take
down Kakashi?
158
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,450
Twenty-two.
159
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,030
Huh, it seems I win again!
160
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,780
That was my twenty-third.
161
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,360
Yeah, yeah all right…
162
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,940
That poser attitude of yours
still makes you cool!
163
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,940
That’s the reason you are my rival!
164
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,610
– Let’s go! 					– All right!
165
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,110
Hey, Yashamaru…
I have a favor to ask!
166
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
What is it?
167
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,990
I want some ointment.
168
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,990
Sorry about earlier…
lt must’ve hurt.
169
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,860
This is medicine.
170
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,950
If you want it--
171
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,030
Go home…freak!
172
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,650
Oh, what the--?!
173
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,650
Hey, be careful, you brat--
174
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,940
Y-You are…
175
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,740
– Again… 					– Go home, freak!
176
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,070
These eyes…
177
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,990
Y-You are…
178
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,530
Why…? Why?!
179
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,950
H-Hey!
180
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,940
What the--? What’s going on?
181
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,240
It’s…it’s Gaara!
182
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,700
Hey! This guy's dead.
183
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,990
Father…
184
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,450
As I thought… Things don’t go well…
185
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,940
Why is it…that only I’m such a freak?!
186
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,030
What…am I?!
187
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,990
The thing that can cure
a wound of the heart is love.
188
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,940
Yashamaru!
189
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,530
Huh?
190
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,650
Why? Why me…?
191
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,900
Why always me?!
192
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,820
Who…? Why…?
193
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Well done…Gaara.
194
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,490
Yashamaru…!
195
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,320
It’s those eyes…
196
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,240
What’s the matter?
Weren’t you gonna run away?
197
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,610
Sasuke…
198
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,900
Naruto…
199
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,450
What are these two…to you?!
200
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,400
T-These two are…my friends!
201
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,900
Try laying so much as
another finger on them!
202
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,450
I’ll clobber you!
203
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,820
So…what’s the matter?!
Weren’t you gonna clobber me?
204
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,070
Hurry up and come at me…
205
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,400
Darn it!
206
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:28,070
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
207
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:39,400
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
208
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:55,070
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
209
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,110
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
210
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,530
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
211
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,780
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
212
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:20,940
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
213
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:31,740
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
214
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:42,280
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
215
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,940
Forge on strong
216
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,320
I know this guy’s strength.
217
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,450
I may seem like a senseless
weakling to him.
218
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,030
But…what’s…?
What’s this feeling welling up inside me?
219
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,940
I don’t know…
220
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,450
I don’t know,
but I just don’t want to lose to this guy!
221
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,900
Next time: “Light vs. Dark:
The Two Faces of Gaara”
//%
1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:09,690
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:17,940
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,230
One more time
4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,940
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,480
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,190
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,890
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,480
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,730
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,890
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,940
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,890
One more time
15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
Dang it!
16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,980
Darn it! Things will really be bad
if it stays like this…!
17
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,810
I’ll have to…
18
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,230
I’ll have to save…
everyone for sure!
19
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,230
Light vs. Dark:
The Two Faces of Gaara!
20
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,890
So you’ll fight for the sake of others?!
21
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,900
That’s why you guys are
only at that level!
22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,730
You don’t need a reason to fight!
23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,310
Only the one who remains undefeated
can actually feel his own existence!
24
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,980
Come on, forget about
your insignificant friends
25
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,730
and fight only for the sake
of your own existence!
26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,480
Insignificant…
27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,650
friends?
28
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,100
Those who hold silly sentiments
about fighting
29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
should just die!
30
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,980
I'm sick of listening to you talk!
31
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,890
I'll clobber you for sure!
32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,520
You guys misunderstand real strength!
33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,890
Shut up!
34
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,940
W-Why…? Why is it?!
35
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,770
Why Yashamaru…?
36
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,310
Why did you, why…?
37
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,520
Why…?
38
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,730
Love is…
39
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,980
a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,
40
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,650
to love and watch over that person.
41
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,560
Just like my older sister did.
42
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,890
You are a precious person
who is close to me, Gaara!
43
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,270
Always…
only Yashamaru would always…
44
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,230
Me…always me…
45
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,940
It was an order.
46
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,270
I was commissioned to kill you…
47
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,980
By your father…
48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,650
Lord Kazekage.
49
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,480
My father…?
50
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,230
Why did my father…?
51
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,890
Why…? Why me?
52
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,020
Gaara, you who were born and possessed
by the Sand Spirit Shukaku…
53
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,810
have been watched over
as an experiment.
54
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,350
However, Gaara, you couldn’t
control the living spirit Shukaku,
55
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,020
the Sand Spirit which possesses
the power of the sand.
56
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,270
Eventually your existence would
become too dangerous for the village.
57
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,230
Before that occurred…
58
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,810
So Yashamaru, you had not choice…
59
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,940
but to comply with my father’s order…?
60
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,310
No… That is not correct.
61
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,520
It is true I accepted
Lord Kazekage’s order.
62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,310
But if I had wanted to turn it down,
I could have turned it down.
63
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Gaara…
64
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,100
Deep down in my heart,
I probably…
65
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,940
hated you.
66
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,270
You, whose birth took the life
of my beloved older sister.
67
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,980
The child she left behind in death…
68
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,520
Thinking that you were her remembrance,
I tried desperately to love you.
69
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,890
However… I was not able to.
70
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,100
My sister didn’t choose to have you.
71
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,560
My sister became a sacrifice
for the village,
72
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,150
and she died while
cursing this village!
73
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,850
From that time, I probably…
74
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,890
have been burdened with a wound
of the heart that could never heal.
75
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,100
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,
76
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,480
it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.
77
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,850
A wound of the heart?
78
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,900
Your name…
is the name my sister gave you.
79
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,190
"This child’s name is Gaara…
80
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,770
"A devil that loves only itself…
81
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,890
"Love only yourself…
82
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,890
"And fight only for
your own sake.
83
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,810
"If you do that,
you will continue to exist."
84
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,230
Such was the hope it contained.
85
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,810
However…
86
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,310
my sister did not give you this name
87
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,060
because she was concerned
about you or loved you.
88
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,850
The reason she gave you this name,
a name so you would continue to exist…
89
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,480
…was so that the deep-seated hatred
of my sister
90
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,480
who died hating and cursing
this village…
91
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,310
would remain…
92
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,770
and be known to all!
93
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,400
You were never…loved!
94
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,560
This is the last…
95
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,890
Please die…
96
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,650
I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.
97
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,850
Love?
98
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,770
The sand automatically trying to
protect you is like the love of a mother.
99
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,890
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother’s will.
100
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,480
Love.
101
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,650
Love only yourself.
102
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,770
And fight only for your own sake.
103
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,650
So that is Gaara…
That is me.
104
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,890
I finally understand.
105
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,230
I am alone.
106
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,310
I will no longer believe in anyone…
or love anyone.
107
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,400
I am alone!
108
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,520
Yes, I am all by myself.
109
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,600
What’s the matter?
Hurry up and come at me!
110
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,440
Don't you care what happens
to your so-called precious friends?!
111
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,650
Sakura!
112
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,890
Dang it!
113
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,890
Naruto’s not his usual self…
114
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,150
Did something happen between them?
115
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,190
In any case…
116
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,940
In any case,
I need to save Sakura!
117
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,270
But… what to do?!
118
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,850
That’s it!
119
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,890
Since it's come to this…
Though it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra…
120
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,440
There’s no choice
but to summon the Chief Gamabunta!
121
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,230
Summoning Jutsu!
122
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,850
What’s this?! You’re a little kid!
123
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,230
If you want something from me,
give me some snack!
124
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,900
If you don’t, I won’t play with you!
125
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,690
You know something?
I hate you frogs!
126
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,890
What did you say?!
Don’t make fun of amphibians! Really!
127
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,650
Jeez, I don’t have time to
play with you, little squirt!
128
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,020
Darn! Why is it…?
129
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,890
I practiced for so long, but with this,
there’s no other way…
130
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,690
I need to save everyone!
131
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,270
Everyone…you say?
132
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,890
Don’t make me laugh.
133
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,400
I fight…only for myself!
134
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,100
He…he’s transforming again!
135
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,890
If you don’t take me down,
the sand over this girl won’t fall away!
136
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,600
Not only that, as time passes…
137
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,940
this sand will slowly squeeze tighter
and eventually suffocate this girl!
138
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,480
Sakura!
139
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,890
He’s getting closer and closer
to being a Perfect Possession.
140
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,150
That Jutsu hasn’t been activated yet,
141
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,310
but at this rate, I’ll also be…!
142
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,060
Those eyes…
143
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,190
Sand Shuriken!
144
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,440
You’re…really weak!
145
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,890
Shut up!
146
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,100
But what is that guy?
147
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,690
You’re persistent…
Sarutobi Sensei!
148
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,650
I-It doesn’t move?!
149
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,440
Y-You hard-to-kill fools!
150
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,100
Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?
151
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,520
The Leaf Village is my home!
152
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,650
I told you I am the pillar
of that house!
153
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,150
That’s why I’m saying
I will break that pillar!
154
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,190
As long as the people of the village
155
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,770
fiercely fight to protect
their dear comrades,
156
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,690
the pillar of the Leaf Village will not
be broken by the likes of you!
157
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,890
I wonder about that.
158
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,400
Do not underestimate the Hokage!
159
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,690
I-Impossible…!
160
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,520
Where is…?
Most of your Chakra should be gone!
161
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,890
Chakra and Ninjutsu are
not all there is to strength!
162
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,890
W-What lonely eyes…
163
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,770
Such lonely eyes…
164
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,810
This guy is also turning into a monster…
the same as me.
165
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,310
I hated every last one of them.
166
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,850
I didn’t understand who I was,
167
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,600
why I was so hated,
why I even existed.
168
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,730
In other words,
169
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,900
you’re the Nine-Tailed Fox who killed
lruka’s parents and ruined the village!
170
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,190
You’ve been deceived by everyone
in the village all along!
171
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,890
I…
172
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,890
When I learned that the
Nine-Tailed Fox was inside me,
173
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,890
everyone in the village seemed
even more cold-hearted…
174
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,650
I was so deeply troubled…
175
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,890
But…
176
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,600
Naruto! Let’s go have
ramen for a change!
177
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,940
Yay! I will, I will!
178
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,270
I’ll have the one with
extra BBQ pork slices!
179
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Huh! You loser…
lf you want to beat me train harder!
180
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,150
Shut up! I won’t lose to you!
181
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,190
Hey Naruto!
What did Sasuke say about me?
182
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,890
He didn’t say anything…
183
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,150
By the way! By the way!
Wouldn't you rather know how I feel…?
184
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,270
Oh! Really, Sakura!
185
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,690
I’m gonna eat now!
186
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,020
Um… Naruto, you’ll really die if you eat
only noodles and sweet red bean porridge.
187
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,890
You’re a Ninja,
so eat more vegetables!
188
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,520
Here, have some!
189
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,350
What?! I don’t like vegetables!
190
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,560
People appeared
who acknowledged me…
191
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,350
That’s why I became all right,
192
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,350
even though there was
the demon fox inside my body,
193
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,890
or even if the people of the village
looked at me with cold eyes.
194
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,690
Because…
I wasn’t alone anymore!
195
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,600
I never imagined how happy and
fortunate I could feel.
196
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,890
How really…really…
197
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,890
great it was.
198
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,900
How truly great it was
to be here.
199
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,690
I was relieved to know
I am allowed to be here, to exist!
200
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,520
That’s why it scares me
to think about the past…
201
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,890
That suffering is agonizing…
202
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,940
It’s a pitch-black hell!
203
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,690
If…I had remained that way, all alone…
204
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,890
That’s precisely why I understand!
205
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,650
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?
206
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,560
This is the answer I came to…
207
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,600
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.
208
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,150
I don’t know what happened, but…
209
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,190
This guy’s always been
suffering all alone…
210
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,690
Even now, without ever feeling relief…
211
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,150
Only able to believe in himself…
212
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,690
Even now, he’s battling in hell…
213
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,350
That’s how it is…
214
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,900
To him, someone like me
who's acknowledged by others…
215
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,350
might seem like a weakling in
a world of happiness without tension…
216
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,890
Can I really win against
a guy like this?
217
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,900
What’s the matter?!
Are you afraid of me?
218
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,440
To fight for the sake of oneself?
To fight for the sake of others?
219
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,480
You should just love yourself,
and fight for yourself!
220
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,230
That is the definition of
the strongest one!
221
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,060
Now fight me!
222
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,350
What happened to
the boldness you had earlier?!
223
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,270
Show me your strength!
I’ll throw that strength to the ground!
224
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,890
Now what’s the matter?!
lf you don’t fight me, I’ll kill that girl!
225
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,480
Darn it!
226
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,650
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
227
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,890
Wind Style!
228
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,890
Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!
229
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,520
This isn’t good…
He really got me.
230
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,810
First, I’ll toy with you
without killing you!
231
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,650
I look forward to seeing
when and how you give up
232
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,190
and abandon your friends!
233
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,770
Naruto…
234
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,730
But…what is it?
235
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,480
It’s far from over!
236
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,350
N-Naruto…
237
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,890
What is this…this feeling?
238
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,060
Sand Shuriken!
239
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,520
D-Dang it!
240
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,810
Dang it!
241
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,890
H-He's…
242
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,940
What is this?!
This feeling that’s overcoming me?
243
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,940
Naruto…!
244
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,890
For some reason…
I don’t want to lose to this guy…
245
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,890
You…
246
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,020
…even if I die!
247
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:27,940
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
248
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:39,270
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
249
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,940
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
250
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,980
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
251
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,400
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
252
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,650
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
253
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:20,890
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
254
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:31,600
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
255
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:42,150
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
256
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,890
Forge on strong
257
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,730
Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!
258
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,690
If you're far away,
listen well.
259
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,350
If you’re closer,
then come and watch it!
260
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,020
Among all the Genin in the Leaf,
261
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
I’m the only one who’s
suited to become Hokage!
262
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,900
I turn the biggest pinch
into opportunity
263
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,020
with Transform Jutsu, Summoning Jutsu,
and Shadow Clone Jutsu.
264
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,890
I give back twice as much
when I receive a punch.
265
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,770
I’m the hyperactive knucklehead Ninja!
266
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,890
This is the start of the spiraling series
of Naruto’s Ninja Handbook!
267
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,100
Next time: “Naruto’s Ninja Handbook”
//%
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:09,770
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:18,020
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,310
One more time
4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,020
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,560
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,270
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,940
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,560
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,810
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,890
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:18,020
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:26,890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,890
One more time
15
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,480
Hit it or Quit it:
The Final Rounds Get Complicated!
16
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,900
You…
17
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,730
You did it!
18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,850
So that fox kid can fight like this…
19
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,440
That was awesome!
20
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,890
Well done!
21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,980
That was a great fight!
22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,150
Yay!
23
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,440
And he still has the energy
to run around…
24
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,890
Man… He’s got crazy stamina that guy…
25
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,940
That Naruto…
26
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,890
He keeps getting stronger…
27
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,100
He did it…that kid.
28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,730
Yeah! He’s on the right track!
29
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,770
And he’s a little cute…
30
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,150
Something about it…
31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,810
I’m envious of you…
32
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,890
Watching your battle makes me think
that I have to work really hard too…
33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,020
That’s amazing, you know?
34
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,150
He won. Is it for real?
35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,890
I thought he was the same as me,
in the not going anywhere class…
36
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,600
Not going anywhere?
37
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,980
Now people are squealing...
38
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,900
Looks like he’s part of the group
that’s going somewhere.
39
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Maybe I couldn’t beat him…
40
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,600
This is really bad.
lt kinda depresses me…
41
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,560
To retain himself and draw out
the Chakras of the Nine-Tailed Fox…
42
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,890
Yeah… Most of the Leaf Village people
here are surprised.
43
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,440
That Naruto…
44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,100
When did he learn to control the strength
of Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent?
45
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,400
Even a bird who gets caught,
once it learns how,
46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,020
will open the lid of its basket
with its own beak.
47
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,980
He won't give up, for he wants to
fly freely in the sky again.
48
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,520
This time you lost!
49
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,890
Father…
50
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,890
It’s okay, there’s no damage
to his internal organs.
51
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,890
It seems like his Chakra
is almost used up.
52
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,400
You are not the only one special.
53
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,020
Why do you act against
your fate that much?!
54
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,850
Because I was called a failure…
55
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,890
Those who become Hokage
are born to that fate.
56
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,690
So what?!
57
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,100
Lord Hyuga!
58
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,850
I’m sorry but…
Could you step out for a moment?
59
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,650
B-But…
60
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,150
It won’t take long.
61
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,650
Y-Yes.
62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
What do you need from me?
63
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,730
That day…
64
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,690
I came to tell you the truth…
about that day.
65
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,940
That day…?
66
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,190
At that time, I intended to die!
67
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,400
W-What are you talking about?!
68
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,520
That day my father…
69
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,890
He was killed
as your body double!
70
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,770
The truth of that day…is here.
71
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,190
They're probably only excuses made
at the convenience of the head family.
72
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,890
The person you are now…
should be able to understand.
73
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,890
This writing…!
74
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,560
Neji… I only have a little time left.
75
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,980
I want to use that limited time
to convey something to you…
76
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,230
Convey something to me?
77
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,520
The head of Ninjas from the
Land of Lightning,
78
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,690
who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata,
was killed by Lord Hiashi…
79
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,020
But the Land of Lightning didn’t
acknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,
80
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,980
made only the killing
of the head Ninja a problem,
81
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,560
and made unreasonable demands.
82
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,890
It can’t be helped.
83
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,650
With my one life,
the village can be saved…
84
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,890
Wait, Hiashi. Don’t be so hasty!
85
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,480
The Hyuga’s Kekkei Genkai
is an important strength of this land.
86
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,980
It is the duty of the head family
to protect it forever…
87
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,810
However, for the sake of that duty…
88
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,230
if we involve our land
in a desperate war…!
89
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,890
I understand that!
That’s why…
90
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,100
Isn’t that why
we have branch families?
91
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,940
Hizashi’s corpse…
We’ll hand it over as your body double.
92
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,480
Hizashi too…
understands the situation.
93
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,650
However, what they want is
the secret of the power of the Byakugan.
94
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,270
The point in time that
Hizashi becomes a corpse,
95
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,690
that power will be sealed.
96
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,310
I don’t believe that the Land of Lightning
will consent to that.
97
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,350
That’s their true intent,
98
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,350
but the condition made by Lightning is to
“Hand over Hiashi Hyuga’s dead body.”
99
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,890
We pretend that we agreed
to their terms,
100
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,730
and hand Hizashi,
who is identical to you, over...
101
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,650
and they can’t pursue it
any further than that.
102
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,770
B-But…
103
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,890
Hiashi… The time has come…
104
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,650
Your predecessors have done the same
to protect the power of Hyuga clan.
105
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,900
Even siblings…
have the heart to write each other off.
106
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,890
That is the fate of the head family.
107
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,400
And this…is the destiny of
ones born into Hyuga!
108
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,890
Where has Lord Hiashi,
who is always bullish, go?
109
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,600
The scale of this issue is different
from the ones in the past!
110
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,980
It’s not that easy…
111
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,440
H-Hizashi…you…
112
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,560
Please…let me go.
113
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,350
You… You…have Neji.
114
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,890
Why do you choose death…
for the head family?!
115
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,810
That’s not so!
116
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,980
I have been resenting
the head family.
117
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,060
To tell the truth
even now I’m bitter.
118
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,020
That’s why…
119
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,270
I want to die protecting you as
“my brother,” not as the head family.
120
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,440
It’s the first time I’ve had
the freedom to choose.
121
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,270
I’ve only shown Neji my ugly side.
122
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,190
However, now I’ve come here
and finally know my own intentions.
123
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,520
So please tell Neji…
124
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,310
I-I wasn’t killed to protect
the head family…
125
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,730
but to protect my siblings,
family and the land…
126
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,890
by my own will I chose death!
127
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,440
T-To choose death…
you call that freedom…?
128
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,690
Big brother…
129
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,690
Once, just this once,
I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.
130
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,310
I wanted to choose my own fate.
131
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,060
That’s all.
132
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,310
Overcome your own fate, Neji…
133
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,400
Fate is something you work out
with your own hands.
134
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,520
Father…
135
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,520
This is…the truth!
136
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,890
I’m sorry!
137
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,350
Please…raise your head.
138
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,560
Father…
139
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:54,020
I wonder if a person’s destiny is
only floating like a cloud in a fixed current…
140
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,480
Or is a person able to ride
on the current that he chooses.
141
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,890
I don’t understand it well yet.
142
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,890
Whichever, the end point
might still be the same…
143
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,060
Just, when the choice is the latter…
144
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,890
people turn toward the goal of
living and work hard toward it.
145
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,650
And those who hold that
are really strong.
146
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,890
I feel like I finally understand,
through this battle…
147
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,890
And… father…
148
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
I have only one goal…
149
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,690
I want to become stronger,
so I won’t lose to anyone.
150
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,650
That’s how I feel now.
151
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,190
Father…I see many birds flying.
And they seem to be enjoying themselves.
152
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,230
It’s buzzing.
153
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,770
That’s because it was a good battle…
154
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,560
Certainly, there’s that too, but…
155
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:09,230
It’s likely that, for the curious heads
of Ninja and the feudal lords,
156
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,600
there is no match they look forward to
more than this next match.
157
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,480
By the way, it seems that
he wasn’t seen at the opening ceremony…
158
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,270
He’s arrived here already, hasn’t he?
159
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,190
There’s been no news of Sasuke.
160
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,400
And there’s the issue of Orochimaru.
161
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,560
Before everyone starts to make noise,
we should disqualify him…
162
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,060
What’s going on?!
Hurry up and start the next match!
163
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,890
How long are you going to
make us wait!
164
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,560
Before night falls!
165
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,600
I wonder what’s going on
with the next match?
166
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,480
Is Sasuke here?
167
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,190
Sasuke…
168
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,980
That guy…
What in the world is he doing?!
169
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,770
Is he planning
not to show up?
170
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,480
A wise man never courts danger…
171
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,480
A wise judgement…is it?
172
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,400
What are you saying?
173
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,400
He’ll definitely come! Believe it!
174
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,350
But seriously, what is he doing?
175
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,890
Keep this up and he…
he’ll be disqualified.
176
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,890
There’s no choice…
177
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,560
Sasuke is…disqualified.
178
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,270
Yes.
179
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,690
Sasuke Uchiha is…disqualified?
180
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,890
It has to be done.
181
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,890
What in the world are
we going to do?
182
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,770
If that guy doesn’t show up,
our plan of strategy…
183
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,690
This isn’t good…
184
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,400
Could he have…?
185
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,890
Where are you going, Gaara?
186
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,020
I’m going to confirm my existence…
187
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,100
Darn that Gaara…
188
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,890
I wonder if he really killed him…
189
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,190
Sasuke one more time…
190
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,560
What happened?
191
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,520
It’s obvious that you’re there
standing with the thirst for blood.
192
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,980
Why don’t you come out?
193
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,890
It’s you…
194
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,440
Lord Hokage…
195
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,480
I want you to consider waiting a little bit
for Sasuke Uchiha’s disqualification.
196
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,810
I understand your point, but…
197
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,890
No matter how excellent the Shinobi,
198
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,890
to make light of time is not
a qualification for Chunin.
199
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,600
If there’s no clear reason to satisfy
200
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,850
the heads of Ninja and feudal lords
who are here,
201
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,770
there’s no reason to wait for him!
202
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,350
I see…
203
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,850
Well then, there is a sufficient reason.
204
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,270
Including myself…
205
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,560
most of the heads of Ninja and
feudal lords that are here…
206
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,100
came here because
they want to see the next match.
207
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,600
However…
208
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,480
He’s the remaining survivor
of the “Uchiha.”
209
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,350
Land of the Wind too, absolutely,
is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.
210
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,230
Lord Hokage…
211
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,890
There’s no guarantee that
Sasuke will come but…
212
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,850
All right then…
213
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,690
We shall specially postpone
this match and wait.
214
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,690
Lord Hokage! Really…
215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,980
Inform so to the Proctor!
216
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,310
Y-Yes.
217
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,730
However…
218
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,270
It’s rare for you to insist like that,
Lord Kazekage.
219
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,940
Well…
220
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,810
To show off the Shinobi’s qualities
of our village to the feudal lords…
221
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,310
there’s no better opponent
than an Uchiha.
222
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,560
It’s a chance for us as well.
223
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,100
C’mon, what happened to the match?!
224
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,890
What happened to Uchiha?!
225
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,900
I understand…
226
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,350
Everyone! The candidate for the
next battle has not arrived here!
227
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,350
We’ll briefly postpone this battle
and start the following battle ahead of it.
228
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,890
What is he doing…that Sasuke?
229
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,890
Great, so Sasuke didn’t get disqualified!
230
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,980
That’s good…
231
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,900
Hey! That means my match
is one match closer!
232
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,150
Then, on to the next pair!
233
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,850
Kankuro and Shino Aburame!
Come down!
234
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,190
My match…doesn’t matter at all.
235
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,890
More importantly…
236
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,940
I'd rather not expose the Mechanism
of Crow to the enemy before the plan…
237
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,890
Proctor!
238
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,520
I abstain!
239
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,350
What?!
240
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,940
I abstain!
Please advance the matches!
241
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,690
Due to Kankuro’s abstention,
Shino Aburame wins by default!
242
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,190
What’s that all about?!
243
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,230
Have a proper match!
244
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,850
You are…?
245
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,520
It’s my turn, isn’t it?
246
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,310
It seems that you’re really fired up.
247
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Okay, let’s go to the next match.
248
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,690
Hey! The last one, come down!
249
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,900
Hey! Hey! What are you doing,
frivolously building things up?
250
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,730
I mean, why does only
my match have to be modified?
251
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,480
Shikamaru Nara! You!
252
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,890
Damn…
lf it’s like this I’ll abstain too…
253
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,230
C’mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!
254
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,060
Damn that Naruto…
255
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,600
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
256
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,890
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
257
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,480
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
258
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,850
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
259
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,150
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
260
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
261
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,350
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
262
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,810
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
263
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,020
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
264
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,440
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
265
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,730
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
266
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:30,980
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
267
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:37,650
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
268
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:44,890
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
269
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,940
Go! Shikamaru!
270
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,690
It looks a bit strange that Shikamaru
is fighting in the Final Round.
271
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,770
He's good, firing up, burning up!
That's my teammate!
272
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,060
But, doesn't he seem spaced out
looking at the sky?
273
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,890
He totally looks so ambitious.
All right, Shikamar!
274
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,810
Keep it up and 					attack hard!
275
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,980
Nex time, "Zero Motivation:
The Guy with Cloud Envy!"
276
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,650
Ino, your cheering is kinda scary.
//%

00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,310
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,730
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,350
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,850
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,480
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,770
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,350
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,890
Sasuke…
21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,850
My, my arm!
22
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,730
Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?
23
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,690
Please take this medicine quickly.
24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,270
Oh, my…
25
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,400
Just as I get back,
I have to clean the room.
26
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,480
Please make sure you to take
your medicine.
27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,350
I don't need that kind
of lip service.
28
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,690
It's medicine that I prescribed.
29
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,690
The pain should subside
at least slightly.
30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,560
The pain on this arm
that seems to burn…
31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,310
I never thought that it cause
this much suffering.
32
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,310
Sarutobi…known as Third Hokage.
lt's his last curse, after all.
33
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,810
Enough of the talking…
34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,480
More importantly,
has that individual been found?
35
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,690
Yes… She seems to be at a place
called Tanzaku Town.
36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
Tanzaku Town…
37
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,890
Is that so…?
38
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,690
But the opponent is one of the Sannin,
the Legendary Three Ninjas.
39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,150
It won’t be that simple.
40
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,890
Good medicine tends to taste bitter.
41
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,440
Here.
42
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,940
It’s the same one…
But this is the trick?
43
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,270
You’re the type who was yelled at
at the academy
44
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,650
for not having concentration, right?
45
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,230
That doesn’t have anything
to do with me now.
46
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,810
Look at this paper.
47
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,810
Uh?
48
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,560
I’ve seen it.
49
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,770
Fine, then.
50
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,940
Look at it again.
51
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,850
Hmm?
52
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,940
So what is this?
53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,560
It’s not something that
I need to explain in length,
54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,020
but when you first looked
at this blank piece of paper,
55
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,650
you just glanced at
the whole thing, correct?
56
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,150
Probably.
57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,890
Then where do you look on this one?
58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Most likely the point in the middle?
59
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,440
When a human being looks at
just a blank piece of paper,
60
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,020
he doesn’t know where to look,
so the eyes wander.
61
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,650
But if you put even a single point on it,
62
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,440
the mind focuses there…
63
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,690
This is concentrating at a single point
and as you focus your mind,
64
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,270
you become spiritually stable and
you are able to extract unexpected power.
65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,350
Huh?
66
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,020
When you opened a hole
on the rubber ball,
67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,560
you must have been
concentrating desperately
68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,100
to fill up the Chakra
in the palm of your hand.
69
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah, yeah.
70
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,480
When you concentrate,
power emerges.
71
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,890
But without a target,
it is difficult to concentrate.
72
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,150
That’s why we have this…
73
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,850
Listen Naruto, from now on,
74
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,520
when you store up the Chakra
you build in your right hand,
75
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,230
try to store it up by concentrating
on that mark.
76
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,350
Concentrate…
77
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,560
All right, I’ll try it!
78
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,890
Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf
79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,890
Concentrate!
80
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,100
Darn it. It’s not supposed to be like this.
81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,890
It has to break like “pang.”
82
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,480
Concentrate!
83
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,890
Hello… I’d like to make a little inquiry.
84
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,060
Dang it.
85
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,440
Concentrate.
86
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,890
Concentrate!
87
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,400
No good.
88
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,890
Dang it. What does it mean
to concentrate?!
89
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,890
Damn you, Sarutobi!
90
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,350
All right then…
91
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,100
I’m going again to gather
some information.
92
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,810
What…? But you just came.
93
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,350
I don’t have any time to waste.
94
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,480
Hey, hey…!
95
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,310
Isn’t there going to be even
a little soulful game of catch
96
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,890
between the master and pupil?
97
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,850
You scoundrel.
98
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,150
Strike!
99
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,060
Here,  the game of catch is over.
100
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,060
See you later.
101
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,980
Humph… I’ll forget about that Pervy Sage
and work hard by myself.
102
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,600
That’s the only way, Naruto…
103
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,270
You have to do this training alone.
104
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,190
You have the ability to approach
the Fourth Hokage’s level…
105
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,100
Grasp it by yourself!
106
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,890
Hmm… Never seen her.
107
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,520
If that’s the case…
108
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,350
Sorry to bother you.
109
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,890
I know the person.
110
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,940
As well as where she is right now.
111
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,020
I’ll buy you a drink.
112
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,690
There’s no need.
I was able to win a tidy sum…
113
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,100
Thanks to that lady.
114
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,230
Yeah…you are indeed
the Legendary Sitting Duck.
115
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,940
She lost again, huh.
116
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,890
Her losses started to pile up…
117
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,940
So she was talking about
changing her location.
118
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
Where to?
119
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,890
One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade,
is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.
120
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,350
Then this arm can finally…
121
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,100
Even if it’s good medicine,
122
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,560
you won’t get away with just
a bitter taste with that person.
123
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,190
It’s fine.
124
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,890
Seven, seven, seven…
125
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,020
Seven, seven, seven…
126
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,310
Seven, seven, seven…
127
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,980
Here it comes!
128
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,890
Congratulations to the customer!
129
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,650
Fever has started
on machine number 44.
130
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,890
Now, please keep on getting it out
like a flood.
131
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,440
Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happen
once in while.
132
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,810
A 3-7 for me?
133
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,850
Oh wow, lady.
134
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,890
Yeah, what a great work.
135
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Wish I could be favored
by good fortune too.
136
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,890
– Oh, here it comes again!
– Here it comes again!
137
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,890
Yay…it’s “fever” again!
138
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,890
A person like me pulls
a big hit like this…
139
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,230
I have a bad premonition.
140
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,890
I also have some knowledge
regarding Lady Tsunade…
141
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,730
I did use to be part of
the Medical Corps, after all.
142
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,770
She was the first person to propose
what is now an accepted practice
143
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,890
of assigning one medical specialist
to a small squad of four.
144
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,980
This was a very revolutionary- idea…
145
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,890
A small combat unit that doesn’t
even have emergency medical skills,
146
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,230
what would happen to them in a battlefield
is clearer than seeing fire.
147
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,770
Countless experiences in war
148
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,690
simply became knowledge
to equip themselves with.
149
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,310
Many who were sacrificed
led to the creation of that style.
150
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,850
A person understands the nature
of things for the first time
151
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,650
after losing them.
152
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:51,230
And the thing created by
one of the legendary Sannin,
153
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,480
who is known as the medical specialist
154
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,020
is that sacrifice.
155
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,730
Not working…
156
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,600
I got to concentrate even more.
157
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,150
Concentrate, concentrate.
158
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,940
Concentrate, concentrate.
159
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,890
Concentrate!
160
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,890
Concentrate…
161
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,850
Concentrate on one point.
162
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,890
Strike!
163
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,440
Strike!
164
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,890
That stupid perve’s face floats up
in my head
165
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,890
and I can’t even concentrate.
166
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,940
Oh boy…
167
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,150
Some gal somewhere is talking
about me again.
168
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,520
Pinball Games
169
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,940
Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!
170
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,890
What’s the matter?
171
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,650
Your winning this much is like a miracle…
172
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,890
But you don’t look pleased at all.
173
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
This town.
174
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,810
Huh?
175
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,400
I get a bad premonition.
176
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,230
We’re going to hurry up and leave.
177
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,230
But this is a tourist resort…
178
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,890
We should take our time and
go see the famous castle and all.
179
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,650
Then we’re going to hurry up
and see it so we can leave.
180
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,440
But…Lady Tsunade!
181
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,850
Lord Orochimaru!
182
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,400
Let’s get this business over with.
183
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,230
Even if we have to use
a slightly rough method.
184
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,310
I got to do it.
185
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,190
Ouch!
186
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,890
Ouch… It hurts so much,
I can’t even build up my Chakra…
187
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,810
He might be reaching his limit soon.
188
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,850
Just a bit…just a bit more rest.
189
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,850
Hey!
190
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,890
You guys, we’re in class right now.
191
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,890
You…fools!
192
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,890
You guys have no concentration at all…!
193
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,650
This is not the way to
become fine Ninja.
194
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,650
How can we stay still at a table,
right, Akamaru?
195
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,440
I’m hungry.
196
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,100
Sensei, if it’s a scolding,
do it quickly.
197
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,230
What the--?! You, you guys…
198
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,890
From now, we will have
an after-school lesson
199
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,060
to teach you guys more concentration!
200
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,890
– What?! 					– What?!
201
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,060
What’s this?
202
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,940
You guys are going to do from now
203
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,890
what the predecessors of
the Leaf Village
204
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,190
used to perform every day
as a concentration method!
205
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,150
It is training to build up Chakra
206
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,440
by concentrating your entire energy
on the leaf on your forehead.
207
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,230
It’s an ancient way of learning
208
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,270
how not to become distracted
from anything else
209
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,850
by concentrating on a single point,
the leaf.
210
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,190
The one who hones his concentration
is truly a great Ninja…
211
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,890
This is the origin of the Leaf Symbol
on the headband.
212
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,890
That sounds like a lie.
213
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,480
Aren’t you making that story up
to force us to try harder?
214
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,900
I’m not making this up!
lt’s a true story.
215
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,560
Anyhow, can you really become
a great Ninja
216
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,980
by just polishing your concentration?
217
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,650
At any rate,
a great Ninja is a guy who’s strong.
218
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,190
Hey, you have a point.
219
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,650
This stuff…
220
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,810
Bye, bye Sensei!
221
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,440
Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.
222
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,650
– We won’t wait!
– We don't have time for that!
223
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,520
Hey! You misfits!
224
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,810
This is the same thing.
225
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,560
I should have paid more attention
to what Iruka Sensei was saying…
226
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,150
I’m so stupid.
227
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,440
But nothing will start
if I just keep on regretting.
228
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,230
All right, I’m going to master this!
229
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,980
Concentrate, concentrate…
230
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,060
Concentrate!
231
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,230
Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does have
a commanding presence!
232
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,890
It’s worth being designated
as the cultural heritage.
233
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,940
Don’t dally…
234
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,190
We’re going to hurry up
and leave this town.
235
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,400
Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully…
236
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,400
It costs nothing to view.
237
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,890
Lady Tsunade?
238
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,480
What is this chill?
239
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,020
Now!
240
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,890
What a kid…
241
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,690
Raising the density in Chakra
to the point that it burns the palm.
242
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,770
He never ceases to amaze me.
243
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,730
It broke.
244
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,100
Good! The second step seems
to be complete.
245
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,690
Hurry… The third step.
246
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,650
That will come later.
247
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,690
We’ll now go meet Tsunade.
248
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,900
That’s…
249
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,770
Orochimaru.
250
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,480
I found you.
251
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,770
A cycle of hardship, right?
252
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,730
Inside, we were crying, right?
253
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:40,890
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
254
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,900
It's a secondary role,
255
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,890
a role in the shadows
256
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,100
But in reaching for that dream,
257
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,850
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
258
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,890
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
259
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,890
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
260
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:20,020
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
261
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,440
Over and over,
we've seen fools
262
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:55,190
I can master the third step while walking?
Give me a break!
263
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,560
Fool! If we don't hurry it up,
we'll lose Tsunade!
264
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,150
Besides, she's short-tempered
and impatient!
265
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,520
Where are we heading?
266
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,730
If she's here in this town, we'll just
look for her from somewhere high up.
267
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,310
– So we'll climb up a castle.
– Castle?!
268
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,850
– Can't you see over there?!
– Which way is "over there"?
269
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,890
I'm saying…
270
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,850
Oh! What the--?!
271
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,150
Next time: "An Impossible Choice:
The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart"
//%
1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,820
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,570
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,360
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,690
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,700
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,150
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,610
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,110
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,570
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,570
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,780
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,450
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,280
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,900
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,360
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,530
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,950
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,490
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,690
The Three Villains from
the Maximum Security Prison
21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,690
All right!
22
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,690
I can start my training!
23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,400
Right now, this is all I can do.
I can’t allow myself to fail!
24
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,400
What’s up?
25
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,200
Going to all the trouble of coming
to pick me up like this…
26
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,610
You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’s
after this anyway, right…?
27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,690
Taking the time to converse
once in a while…
28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,690
that’s also part of teamwork.
29
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,690
Let me hear about your mission.
30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,860
It was pretty incredible…
31
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,700
But you wouldn’t understand
even if I explained it to you.
32
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,360
I don’t want Akamaru to experience
that kind of thing ever again.
33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,690
And for that reason, I must polish
my Jutsu all the more…
34
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,860
I want to hear about it in detail.
35
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,690
Because that’s what teamwork
is about.
36
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,740
Are you sulking
37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,490
‘cause you were the only one
who was passed up?
38
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,700
You are sulking, aren’t you?
39
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,650
There have to be more further up…
40
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,200
Until I can see it…
41
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,610
I can’t believe you’re doing
that from the morning…
42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,950
Neji, let’s take a break.
43
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,780
Okay!
44
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,900
– Let’s go, Hinata! 					– Okay!
45
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,530
Father, see you later.
46
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,200
Barbecued meat?
This early in the morning, huh?
47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,650
Just when he was looking good
after losing some weight
48
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,320
when he was released
from the hospital.
49
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,110
He made an amazing rebound,
didn’t he?
50
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,690
With that good an appetite,
51
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,150
there aren’t any more worries
about his health, are there?
52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,570
When I’m done eating,
help me with my training, okay?
53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,860
Asuma Sensei!
54
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,030
Hey, are you an idiot
or something?!
55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,070
You’re recuperating, you know!
56
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,400
L-Lee… Come on,
let’s take a short break…
57
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,200
What’s the matter, Guy Sensei?
58
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,650
The prime of one’s youth waits
for no one, you know.
59
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,820
Maintaining the prime of one’s youth
is starting to get tough…
60
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,690
Thank you very much!
61
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,740
Do your best, guys…
62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,950
I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu by
the next time you’re here!
63
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,150
M-Me too…
64
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,690
I want to become a Kunoichi
just like you, Temari…
65
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,240
I’m honored.
66
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,690
I apologize for asking you
to teach at the Academy…
67
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,990
since we’re so short-staffed right now.
68
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,530
You probably would've preferred
to go sightseeing or something.
69
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,530
No problem.
I’m doing this because I enjoy it.
70
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,150
Yeah… And we were also able to survey
71
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,070
the future potential of
the Leaf’s military power…
72
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,690
Well, be careful going home.
73
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,650
Okay…
74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,070
If something happens again,
I’ll come to your rescue again.
75
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,610
Just let me know, crybaby.
76
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,780
You always say too much.
That’s why girls are…
77
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,400
Let’s kick butt again today, Akamaru!
78
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,650
All right, everybody’s here right?
79
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,320
You don’t need to be so tense, Hinata…
80
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,780
Y-Yeah…
81
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,740
All right! Everybody stand ready!
82
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,950
I can’t…lose to Naruto…!
83
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,320
All right! I’m ready!
84
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,700
I just have to wait
for Pervy Sage to come--!
85
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,700
There he is!
86
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,780
But my training…
87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Don’t get so pouty, Naruto.
88
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,530
Some work came in all of a sudden.
lt can’t be helped.
89
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,490
It’s just gonna be doing
an interview
90
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,110
for some obscene magazine
anyway, right?
91
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,690
That kind of thing isn’t called work.
92
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,200
It’s a mission to gather information
about the Akatsuki Organization.
93
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,690
But if I tell this guy that,
94
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,320
he might ask me to
let him come.
95
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,360
Humph!
96
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,950
I’ll make it up to you by…
97
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,070
Huh?
98
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,030
W-What’s this?
99
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,690
It’s so that you don’t get bored
while you’re staying at home,
100
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,320
it’s a special training menu
I put together!
101
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,700
Wow!
102
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,450
Wait, wait!
103
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,530
My own prized secret training
methods are inscribed here.
104
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,030
Don’t read this where
other people might see it!
105
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,070
Okay!
106
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,490
Well, do your best!
107
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,070
I’m gonna use this
to train vigorously!
108
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,530
Thank you, Pervy Sage!
109
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,070
The walls have ears…
paper doors have eyes…
110
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,490
Pervy Sage’s secret training methods…
111
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,320
WILLPOWER
112
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,700
What?!
113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,900
Pervy Sage!
114
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,780
Since I have been entrusted
115
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,690
with the great Village Hidden
in the Leaves that you built,
116
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,690
no matter what danger might strike,
it is my duty to protect it.
117
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,280
The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
118
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,570
Yes, you really do.
119
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,030
Is that you, Shizune?
Enter!
120
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,400
All of these reports regarding
the village’s internal affairs accumulated
121
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,690
because so many things
were happening in the Leaf Village.
122
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,900
I guess the only thing to do
is start at the top.
123
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,990
Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
124
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,110
Did its name change?
125
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,650
Yes, in the past
it was called
126
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,400
Prison Specializing in
Capital Offenses Ninja.
127
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,690
Fortunately, because there
is a downward trend
128
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,950
in felonies committed by Shinobi,
129
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,900
along with the downsizing of the facility,
the name was changed as well.
130
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,530
Incarcerated are murderers,
131
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,360
those who were involved in
leaking classified secrets, and so on.
132
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,030
They are all criminal Ninja…
133
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,360
There haven’t been any noticeable
disruptions in the past few years
134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,690
and the facility has been
relatively stable.
135
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,070
– Food! 					– Food!
136
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,860
It’s finally time to eat,
isn’t it, Elder Brother!
137
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,690
Yeah! I’m so excited!
138
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,690
Hey! Fujin! Raijin!
139
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,240
If you don’t shut up,
you’re gonna go without dinner!
140
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,820
Gimme a break! Those guys…
141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,690
You may pass!
142
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,700
Hey! Wait!
143
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,690
You’re hurt, aren’t you?
144
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,690
Go to the dispensary later
and have that looked at.
145
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,030
Okay…
146
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,650
All right, next!
147
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,990
H-Hey, Elder Brother…
148
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Huh?
149
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:46,280
Why is the little finger
short and weak?
150
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,690
That’s easy, Raijin.
151
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,240
If the little finger was thick and strong,
152
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,030
then your thumb would
have no leg to stand on.
153
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,690
I-I see!
154
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,900
Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!
155
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,900
– Huh? 					– A lizard!
156
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,690
Raijin, you’ve always been
a dandy one from way back.
157
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,690
W-We haven’t had enough to eat,
have we, Elder Brother?
158
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,860
Yeah…
159
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,780
Not asking permission again…
160
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,030
What’s the matter?
161
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,400
What’s up this time?
162
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,690
I’m starving…
163
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,690
G-Give us something to eat!
164
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,200
Oh no… If these guys find out
I don’t have anything…!
165
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,700
Um…right now…
166
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,780
Don’t tell me that
you don’t have even one offering…
167
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,740
to these Fujin and
Raijin brothers?!
168
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,400
Well…wait…wait…!
169
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,650
What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
170
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,860
I’ll bring you something else later!
171
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,690
Right now make do with that!
172
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,950
– Okay! 					– Okay!
173
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,550
Are you okay?
174
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,300
Those guys are quiet
when they have food.
175
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,390
But if they get angry
they’re out of control.
176
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,100
Yeah…They annihilated all their comrades
over food during a mission
177
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,800
and the people around just barely
managed to hold them down.
178
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,590
Something smells good?!
179
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,590
Yeah.
180
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,590
This way!
181
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,930
– Food! Food! Food!
– Food! Food! Food!
182
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,470
I just can’t get to liking clerical work.
183
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
There’s still a whole lot more to do,
Lady Tsunade.
184
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,850
I wonder what this is?
185
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,760
It looks like a formula
for some kind of medicine…
186
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,470
A formula…
187
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,180
Send an available Jonin here
immediately!
188
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,850
Yes, ma’am?
189
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,260
Hurry!
190
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,470
Y-Yes, ma’am!
191
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,140
How about it…
Does it taste good?
192
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,590
I see…I see…
There’s still a whole lot more.
193
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,390
Just as I thought,
194
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,390
that good smell was coming
from your place, Elder Brother!
195
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,930
Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brother
always has delicious food!
196
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,930
It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?
197
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,590
’Cause I’d feel so sorry
if you guys had to go hungry.
198
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,720
Elder Brother…
199
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,390
– A lizard! 					– A lizard!
200
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,600
I see, I see…Happy?
201
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,180
How about it, you guys?
202
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,550
Don’t you want to eat things
that are even more delicious?
203
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,350
W-Where are they at?!
204
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,100
If we go to the place where
an old friend of mine is…
205
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,800
you can pig out on food
that’s even more delicious than here.
206
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,590
Is that the guy you told us
about long time ago, Elder Brother?
207
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,140
Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…
208
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,800
Gimme a break…
that guy’s gotta be kidding!
209
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,300
That Pervy Sage…
210
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,890
just leaving me and
my training up in the air!
211
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,180
Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.
212
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
213
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,600
Heh!
214
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,590
It’s probably that
Lady Tsunade decided
215
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,140
that only Master Jiraiya
could do the job…
216
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,590
It can't be helped.
217
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,680
Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’s
doing, after all, huh!
218
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,800
Well, I guess all I can do is treat you
to some ramen noodles like this.
219
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,260
So cheer up.
220
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,350
I’m gonna go complain
to Old Lady Tsunade!
221
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,350
Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
222
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,590
N-Naruto!
223
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,760
Damn… another annoying situation.
224
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,590
Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
225
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,390
This is about a year ago,
226
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,590
a Chunin Academy staff member
used Naruto
227
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,850
to sneak out
the Scroll of Sealing.
228
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,640
According to the report, it was
a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
229
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,220
The crime was solved, but…?
230
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,470
Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
231
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:47,590
The possibility has arisen that
a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
232
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,220
This is a clue…
233
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,140
This is something that Mizuki
was concealing
234
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,930
when he was incarcerated
in the Maximum Security Facility.
235
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,890
At the time, nobody thought of it
as anything more than a doodle.
236
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,600
Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
237
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,220
I don’t know, however…
238
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,590
The handwriting resembles
the document confiscated from the facility
239
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,590
where Orochimaru was conducting
human experiments…
240
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,590
Which means that…
Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
241
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,800
The possibility of that is not zero.
242
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,890
It’s not like a Chunin alone could do
anything with the Scroll of Sealing.
243
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,300
It would only make sense if Orochimaru
were pulling strings from behind.
244
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,930
Asuma! Kurenai!
245
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,180
Go immediately to the Maximum
Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
246
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,890
Orochimaru?!
247
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,590
Be careful! Something’s strange here!
248
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,850
Yeah… It’s too quiet.
249
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,390
Let’s go!
250
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,720
Oh, how touching.
A welome party for us…
251
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,590
Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome.
Right, Elder Brother?
252
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah…
253
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,390
Asuma, don’t tell me that
those guys are…
254
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,140
Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…
255
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,590
Fujin and Raijin!
256
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,180
Asuma…
257
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,590
Hey, you guys are whooping it up
too much for a welcome party!
258
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,430
Hey, calm down…
the welcome party’s just started.
259
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,180
His character has changed completely…
260
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,180
All you jerks…
261
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,640
You will…be our offering!
262
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,930
Do it!
263
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,590
Orochimaru!
264
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,180
Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
265
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,720
Crappy news pass us by
266
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,300
And you become speechless
267
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,300
My voice is way too soft
268
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,590
So you don’t answer
269
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,220
You’re crying   Crying alone
270
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,050
What can I do?   I’m crying too
271
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,590
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
272
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:07,760
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
273
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:17,510
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
274
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:26,590
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
275
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:38,470
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
276
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,850
What’s the matter, Ton Ton?
277
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,590
What in the world happened?
278
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,390
Say, weren't you together
with Shizune?
279
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,180
Don't tell me something's
happened to her?
280
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,760
I don't know what happened,
but take me there, Ton Ton!
281
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,600
I'm getting a bad feeling about this!
282
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,300
Next episode,
“Ton Ton! I'm Counting on You!”

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,730
Fighting Dreamers

Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,730
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,350

Just go my way

Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,770
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18

19

Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,560
This man Jiraiya does not fall victim
to any woman’s allurement,
21
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,100
but rather his forte is
winning women’s affections!
22
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,150
You were totally excited by a lame tactic
like a woman winking at you!
23
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,100
You shouldn’t be the one to try
acting all suave and cool, you Pervy Sage!
24
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,350
Like I said, don’t call me
that in front of people…
25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
Be quiet…
26
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,150
More importantly these people
aren’t normal, Pervy Sage!
27
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,690
Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!
28
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,230
Like I said, don’t call me “Pervy Sage”!
29
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,190
You are, after all, Master Jiraiya,
one of the legendary Sannin…
30
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,310
I didn’t believe that
I’d be able to stop you so easily
31
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,690
despite the fact that you are
a huge womanizer.
32
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,560
What?!
33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,190
You know the true identity
of Pervy Sage?!
34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,440
Well no, that’s not necessarily
who I really am…
35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,100
Seems like you released the Genjutsu
that we had put on that woman.
36
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,890
You shouldn’t call yourself a man
for using such a cowardly tactic
37
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,100
like casting a Genjutsu on the woman
with your hypnotic eyes
38
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,850
to separate me and Naruto.
39
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,900
Separate us…
Why would they do that?
40
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,890
Your target is Naruto, after all.
41
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,400
You are after the Nine-Tailed Fox
in Naruto…
42
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,690
No wonder Kakashi knew that as well…
43
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,150
I see clearly now.
The information source was you.
44
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:15,770
To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
45
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,270
What’s going on…?
46
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,890
I can’t let you have Naruto…
47
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,350
I wonder about that.
48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,310
This is perfect…
I’ll get rid of you two right here!
49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,890
Don’t butt in…
50
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,440
The one that’s going to kill him is …
51
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,190
Me!
52
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,560
Hate Among the Uchihas:
The Last of the Clan
53
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,810
Sasuke…
54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,900
Revenge, I see…
55
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,020
Right now, I have no interest in you…
56
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,600
Don’t mess with me!
57
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Sasuke!
58
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,890
Darn you!
59
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,980
Naruto! I told you not to butt in!
60
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,900
I told you before…
61
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,900
I’ve lived only for this very day…
for this very day!
62
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Sasuke…
63
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,850
Not yet…
64
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,100
You can’t even make a hand sign
together at this point…
65
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,730
This is…my battle!
66
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,480
Fine.
67
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,810
Wha--?
68
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,850
You heard that didn’t you?
69
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,310
This is their battle.
Let’s not bother with it.
70
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,020
Fine then!
71
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,690
Wh-Why…?
72
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,230
Our power difference hasn’t changed
at all since that time…
73
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,890
Why is that?
74
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,690
He doesn’t show any mercy.
75
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,690
What have I…
been doing all this time?
76
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,400
Whatever have I…
77
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,890
You are weak.
78
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,940
And you are weak…
79
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,890
because you don’t have enough hate.
80
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,400
This place is…
81
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,890
This place is…
Could it be?!
82
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,230
That's right.
83
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,690
This is our house.
84
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,190
Dad! Mom!
85
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,690
You are weak.
86
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,480
For the next 24 hours…
87
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,190
Stop it…
88
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,400
Relive that day.
89
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,730
Stop it!
90
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,230
Uncle! Auntie!
91
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,150
You’re not even worth killing.
Foolish younger brother…
92
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,650
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!
Hate me!
93
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,230
And keep on surviving in that
unsightly manner…
94
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,100
Just continue fleeing and fleeing
and hang onto your life!
95
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,980
Hasn’t changed at all…
96
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,890
Using Tsukiyomi: Nightmare Realm
on your own little brother.
97
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,890
Stop it already! You!
98
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,810
Wha--?!
99
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,730
Th-This…
100
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,690
Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!
101
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,980
How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.
102
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,650
You guys are already inside
my stomach!
103
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,890
I summoned the esophagus of
the giant toad
104
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,480
of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.
105
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,900
You guys are wanted criminals anyway.
106
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,150
I’ll turn you guys into fodder
for the stone toad.
107
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,890
What?!
108
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,060
Wh-What is this?
109
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,020
Naruto, you stay still!
110
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,190
Don’t worry, it’s my Jutsu!
111
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,900
Come here, Kisame!
112
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,350
Oh!
113
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,890
Darn it!
114
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,190
It’s useless!
115
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,810
There hasn’t been one person who
has been able to escape from this!
116
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,020
A wall of flesh is charging at us!
117
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
The wall is faster.
118
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,900
At this rate…
119
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,440
Hey…
120
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,890
Pervy Sage!
121
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,230
What’s the matter?!
122
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,850
Huh!
123
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,940
They’ve gone!
124
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,600
I cannot believe that this wall
has been torn through…
125
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,940
Why must we retreat?
You would be…
126
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,400
We have no reason to rush to
get Naruto in the current condition.
127
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,730
Besides, I have to rest
my body somewhere for a while.
128
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,560
Not just Tsukuyomi,
129
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,400
but he also made me
use Amaterasu as well…
130
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,440
What is this fire?
131
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,900
It’s black…
132
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,400
Don’t get so close!
133
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,940
How did those guys manage to get out?
134
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,310
Not only that…
135
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,560
What are these black flames?
136
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,650
The stone toad who has the ability
to blow fire had its intestine’s burned…
137
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,730
Huh…?
138
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,890
All right!
139
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,310
Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!
140
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,890
All right! It’ll be okay for now.
141
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,890
Now for Sasuke!
142
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,850
Sasuke!
143
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,400
Sasuke…
144
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,440
Dynamic…
145
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,270
Guy?!
146
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,980
Entry!
147
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,730
Well… Eh…
148
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,350
I’m sorry to have kicked you so directly.
149
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,850
I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror…
150
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,020
I used this headband instead,
but it was hard to see.
151
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,230
And I assumed this rough-hewn face
was the enemy…
152
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,150
I just let the flames of
the burning juvenescence take over me…
153
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,480
I’m sorry!
154
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,150
Is that … supposed to be an apology?
155
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,940
I’m a simple-minded guy
just like how my face looks.
156
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
It doesn’t really matter.
157
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,980
More importantly, we have to get Sasuke
to the Medical Team!
158
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,890
Yes!
159
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,980
He’s broken his arm and ribs.
160
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,100
Not only that, he’s lost consciousness
161
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,690
from some kind of mental blow
he received from the Visual Jutsu!
162
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,560
This boy also experienced that Jutsu…
163
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,150
Hey Pervy Sage!
ls Sasuke going to be all right?
164
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,850
Seems like he’s received
a significant amount of mental damage.
165
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,060
I’m going to kill you!
166
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,190
Die!
167
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,730
You jerk!
168
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,440
You’re in the way!
169
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,890
Darn… Why?!
170
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,980
What did that guy do to Sasuke?!
171
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,770
Hey, Pervy Sage!
172
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,890
We’ve gotta change our plan!
173
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,100
I got scared earlier,
174
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,270
but this time I’m going to chase
those black-capes and get them!
175
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,890
It’s me that they want, right?!
176
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,060
Then, I’ll be the one to
make my way over!
177
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,690
Humph, you’re only going to be killed
if you go now.
178
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,600
They’re at a totally different level
from you.
179
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,810
I just managed to get you
away from them…
180
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,350
Then, are we just going
to keep running away?!
181
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,230
Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!
182
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,190
Shut your mouth for a second!
183
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,560
You are weak.
184
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,730
I’m sorry, Guy.
185
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,520
I thought that I had spared
the boy’s feeling, but…
186
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,150
I should have saved him much sooner.
187
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,440
Kakashi has also come down
with the same Jutsu…
188
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,900
We don’t know when
he will regain consciousness.
189
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,890
Kakashi Sensei?!
190
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,440
When my students are hurt…
191
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,310
I always wish,
from the bottom of my heart…
192
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,480
If that person,
who is a medical specialist, were here…
193
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,100
That’s why we’re going to
go find her now.
194
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,440
What?
195
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,150
You mean, her?
196
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,890
Could it be…?
197
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,940
W-Wait…!
198
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,940
C-Could this money be…?!
199
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,850
Yup, that’s right…
200
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,890
The one who uses the slug
and drives illness away,
201
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,560
and who is also
one of the Sannin like me…
202
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:06,350
All right! We’re going to turn around
our luck with this!
203
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,600
Princess Tsunade with
the letter “Gamble” on her back!
204
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,650
A cycle of hardship, right?
205
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Inside, we were crying, right?
206
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,890
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
207
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,890
It's a secondary role,
208
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,770
a role in the shadows
209
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,980
But in reaching for that dream,
210
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,730
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
211
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,890
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
212
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,890
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
213
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:19,020
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
214
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,440
Over and over,
we've seen fools
215
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,900
It’s festival, festival, festival!
216
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,890
I’m going to spend like
there’s no tomorrow!
217
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,980
Wait a minute, Naruto!
I will keep your wallet for you.
218
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,850
Huh?!
219
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,190
It’s been said since ages past
that three forbidden factors:
220
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,940
money, alcohol, and women,
are believed to cause Ninja failures.
221
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,770
I am not like you, Pervy Sage!
222
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,810
All right! I am going to
enjoy the festival!
223
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,190
Next time: “A New Training Begins:
I Will Be Strong!”
224
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,850
Wait. What are we gonna
do about my training?
//%
1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,470
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,970
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,600
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,180
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,600
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,600
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,260
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,100
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:44,390
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,760
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,050
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,640
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,220
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,720
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,350
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,930
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,640
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,220
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,430
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,970
I never thought he’d attempt to use
the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.
21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
But it’s still just this level…
22
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,800
It’s completely different
from the original one.
23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,720
That Tsunade…
lncredibly strong as always.
24
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,010
I remember a long time ago,
25
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,470
getting punched by her and
knocked back nearly 100 meters…
26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,640
At any rate, Naruto’s hopeless.
27
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,680
Are you okay?
28
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,840
Jiraiya, was it you…
29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
who taught him that Rasengan,
the Spiral Chakura Sphere?
30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,840
Rasengan…?!
31
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,600
I’m his teacher, after all.
32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,510
Humph…You and the Fourth Hokage are
the only ones who can use that Jutsu.
33
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,840
Are you in your right mind…
34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,470
showing someone Jutsu
that he can’t master?
35
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,510
Don’t give him false hope.
36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,930
That’s why the moony kid starts joking
about becoming a Hokage!
37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,300
It’s no joke! Stupid! Stupid!
38
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,680
If I have three days,
I’ll master this Jutsu!
39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,890
You said it, kid.
40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,390
Men don’t go back on their word!
41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,100
Hah! I stand by my words.
42
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,600
That’s my Ninja Way.
43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,800
Then…how about a wager?
44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
A wager…?
45
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,760
I’ll give you one week.
46
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,760
If you can master that Jutsu,
47
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,350
I’ll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage
48
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,390
and give you this necklace.
49
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,720
Lady Tsunade! That’s the precious--!
50
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,840
I don’t need such a sorry necklace!
51
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,680
Don’t say such things, Naruto…
52
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,390
That’s the only one of its kind in this world.
53
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,350
And you could buy three mountains
if you were to sell it.
54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,010
It belonged to the First Hokage.
55
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,840
A-Awesome…
56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,930
Well, that’ll be fine!
57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,390
He’ll do anything for money…?
58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,470
Good…
59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,350
However, you lose if you can’t master
the Jutsu in one week!
60
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
And you’ll give me all the money
you have on you.
61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,300
Oh! Gama-chan!
62
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,550
When did she…?!
63
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,050
Lady Tsunade! Why?
64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,300
That necklace is…
65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,050
He won’t be able to do it, anyway…
66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,470
Let’s go, Shizune.
67
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,510
She never once used
that necklace for a bet…
68
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,510
You don’t have to answer right now.
69
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,840
However, I want it in a week.
70
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,840
Inheritance!
The Necklace of Death!
71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,470
Huh? Who is it this late at night?
72
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,890
Okay, okay. I’m coming.
73
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,100
I’m sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.
I need to talk to you…
74
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,970
As for me, I’m going to get
a good night’s rest and train tomorrow!
75
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,840
I’m sorry. But I didn’t want you
to misunderstand Lady Tsunade…
76
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,140
As well as the necklace…
77
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,970
Humph! I could care less
about an old lady like that!
78
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,510
Lady Tsunade is not the type
of person you think she is!
79
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,640
Don't speak of her like that
when you don't even know her!
80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
I-I’m sorry…for raising my voice.
81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,220
She didn’t used to be like that.
82
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,350
She was a kind person
who loved the village.
83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,140
But, she changed…
84
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,470
After that day…
85
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,100
That day?
86
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,850
What’s that day?
87
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,180
The day she lost her dreams,
her love, her hopes… Everything.
88
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,850
All that was left was
that necklace of memories…
89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,050
It’s as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.
90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,430
It’s really not something
to be offered in a bet.
91
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,510
I don’t care about that!
She bet it on her own, right?!
92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,180
Besides…that necklace is really
not something for you to wear.
93
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,140
It’s not just a necklace!
94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,840
It doesn’t acknowledge anyone
other than Lady Tsunade.
95
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,720
If someone else wears it,
that person inevitably…
96
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,890
…dies!
97
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,390
Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!
98
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,930
I’m not a kid anymore,
so I don’t need gifts on my birthday!
99
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,180
What’re you saying?
You’re still a kid, aren’t you?!
100
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,510
But never mind that.
Hurry up and open your present!
101
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,600
You’ll definitely be pleased!
102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,850
Big Sister, could this be…?
103
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,470
Yes… It’s the First Hokage’s,
our grandfather’s necklace!
104
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,180
I love you, Big Sister!
105
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,470
I thought it’d be better than me having it.
106
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,180
You’ve been wanting it all along, right?
Take good care of it.
107
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Not just this necklace!
108
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,760
This village is grandfather’s treasure!
I’m going to protect it!
109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
Nawaki…
110
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,430
I’m the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!
111
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,760
You said it.
Men don’t go back on their word!
112
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,600
Right!
113
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Someday, I’ll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!
114
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,720
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
115
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,050
Take off your headband, Nawaki.
116
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,840
Just hurry up and take it off.
I have another present for you.
117
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,680
It’s a charm to make
your dream come true.
118
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,510
It’s best if you don’t look
at the remains.
119
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,430
There’s nothing wrong with that,
is there?
120
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,390
Even if she were to look,
121
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,390
she wouldn’t be able to determine
that it’s her little brother.
122
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,840
Enough, Orochimaru!
123
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,050
We are at war, now.
All Shinobi end up like this.
124
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,760
There are no doctors on
the battlefield, so…
125
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,050
However, children really get
much too excited, don’t they?
126
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,800
Especially on the day after
they receive a present.
127
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Not just this necklace…
128
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,840
This village is grandfather’s treasure!
I’m going to protect it!
129
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,720
First, in a mission where
a Four-Man Cell must act alone
130
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,930
for a long period of time
in enemy territory,
131
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,850
by deploying one of the four
to be a medical specialist,
132
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,260
the survival rate as well as
the mission success rate
133
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,890
should go up significantly.
134
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,930
Therefore, establishing a framework
135
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,840
to foster Ninja possessing
advanced medical skills
136
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,510
and the development of
a medical institution
137
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,430
should be considered
an urgent task for the present!
138
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,180
Yes indeed, it’s as you say.
139
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
But we’re in the middle of a war now.
140
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,680
It takes too much time to
establish a medical framework.
141
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,140
And at present,
we don't have enough knowledge…
142
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,010
Enemies don’t wait.
143
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,010
What did you say?! Hey, old man!
144
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,800
Then we’ll never…
145
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,930
I agree with her.
146
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,890
I don’t want the lives of the Shinobi
who died to be for naught.
147
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,600
There should be something
we can learn from that.
148
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,350
Excuse me!
149
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,300
Thanks for earlier.
150
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,760
What you said was right.
151
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Umm…
152
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,260
It’s late.
Shall I walk you home?
153
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,840
What? Is that okay with you?
Where’s your home?
154
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,840
The other way.
155
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,840
Then don’t bother.
156
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,840
I don’t mind.
I also want to talk with you.
157
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,010
And I would always use this path
to the Academy to pick up my little sister.
158
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,640
I loved this path.
159
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,800
What? You loved?
160
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf
was attacked at night one year ago,
161
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,220
my little sister was…
162
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,840
This man…is the same as me.
163
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Tomorrow’s mission will be
within enemy lines…
164
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,430
Fighting and losing cherished people
is not the only way for a Shinobi.
165
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,720
Uh-huh.
166
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,890
I’m living in a world of Shinobi
where death always hovers.
167
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,510
I want to risk my life to bring
this war-torn world under control.
168
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,680
I love this village and my comrades.
169
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,220
So I want to protect them.
170
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,100
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.
171
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,890
So I’ll become the Hokage…
172
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,890
An existence that protects everyone…
173
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,470
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
174
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,510
Dan…
175
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,470
I’d like you…to take this.
176
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,510
Hang on, Dan!
177
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,840
Tsunade… I don’t want…to die yet.
178
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,260
I have many things that I must…do.
179
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,680
Don’t talk, Dan!
180
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,140
His kidney has been blown out…
181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,930
It’s futile even for Tsunade
who is known as one of the Sannin…
182
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,720
I…must not…die here.
183
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,680
It’ll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.
184
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,970
So it’ll be okay… You’ll be saved, Dan!
185
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,140
Really?
186
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,470
Thank goodness…
187
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,840
Dan! Hang on!
188
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,180
Dan!
189
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,550
Dang it! Don’t come out…
190
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,840
Stop… Please stop!
191
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,010
Stop… Stop…
192
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,550
Stop… Stop…
193
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,470
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
194
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,260
Stop, I say!
195
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,840
That’s enough. He’s dead!
196
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,050
You understand, don’t you, Naruto…?
197
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,640
Ever since that day,
198
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,640
Lady Tsunade has been…
in a constant turmoil.
199
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,100
Naruto…?
200
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,180
I’m heading out…for training!
201
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh, you are already at it, I see!
202
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,720
Hi, welcome!
203
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,840
Why are you here?
204
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,300
You’re cold. Don’t say that.
205
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,760
Master Jiraiya…
206
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,550
Shizune, could you leave us?
207
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,600
It's been a while.
I want to drink with her again.
208
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,390
Master, sake! And some radish!
209
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,100
Coming up!
210
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,510
I’m counting on you, Master Jiraiya.
211
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,970
Your radish is ready.
212
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,850
Ooh. This looks good.
213
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,840
At any rate, to think you’d still be taking
good care of that necklace…
214
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,840
I thought you’d have lost it
long since to gambling.
215
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,430
It’s a memento of those two, right?
216
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,840
Is he on your mind…?
217
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,010
Who?
218
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,640
Naruto.
219
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,840
Not particularly…
220
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,350
Still, it’s immature,
taking on that kid as an opponent…
221
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,840
He shouldn’t be able to master
that Jutsu in a week, right?
222
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,840
That’s not what’s called a bet.
223
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,840
What’s with the fit of despair?
224
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,840
It’s not a fit of despair!
225
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Are you going to meet
Orochimaru again?
226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,720
I can tell by looking at Shizune’s face.
227
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,890
I don’t know what kind of deal
he proposed,
228
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,850
but don’t rush to a decision.
229
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,260
And…let me just tell you one thing.
230
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,220
The successive line of Hokages
have protected
231
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,550
the Leaf Village and those living in it.
232
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,050
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.
233
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,720
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!
234
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,050
You're not someone who can't understand
the feelings of the previous Hokages.
235
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,640
Just try doing something
to betray the Leaf Village.
236
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,470
When that happens, I’ll kill you myself!
237
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,470
It has nothing to do with me now!
238
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,010
A person who has experienced
the death of people close to them
239
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,220
and doesn’t feel anything
is just a butcher.
240
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,430
You’re different, aren’t you?
241
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,260
No one cared for the welfare
of the villagers more than you.
242
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,390
At that time, too…
243
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,600
That’s enough with the lecture!
244
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,140
Why…did you bring that kid?
245
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,260
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
246
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,050
He resembles him, doesn’t he?
247
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,720
His age is about the same, too…
248
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,010
Not just that…
249
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,100
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
250
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,850
Geez, you do nothing,
but reckless things.
251
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,050
Do you want to die?
252
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,640
You’re still a Genin,
so on the battlefield just run away.
253
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,350
Don’t tell a man to “run away”!
254
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,840
That dream… And his cockiness as well…
255
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,390
No good! Dang it! Dang it!
Tomorrow, for sure…!
256
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,260
My head hurts.
257
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,840
I totally got sick from drinking,
thanks to her…
258
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,470
It seems Naruto never came home
last night…
259
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,510
He's such a fool.
260
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,640
Why don’t we make a deal?
261
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,850
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…
262
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,890
with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
263
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,300
Don’t you want to see those two,
Tsunade?
264
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,510
If I treat your arms…
265
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,760
What do you intend to do with them?
266
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,840
This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village!
267
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,930
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk…
268
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,010
Their wishes…
269
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,350
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
And dreams… Did you forget them ?!
270
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,970
I’ll be straight with you.
271
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,220
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.
272
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,010
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
273
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,510
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
274
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,680
On your still shoulder
275
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,300
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
276
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,840
The city lights are like pieces of stars
277
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,800
That hold us together
278
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:57,430
“Each one of us glows differently,”
279
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,010
you say laughingly
280
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,970
but you look most dazzling
281
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,890
Like a comet,
282
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:17,100
like the rainbow after the storm
283
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:24,300
You bring light into my heart
284
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:34,760
Being lost can be the answer
285
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:43,600
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
286
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,680
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
287
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,510
Darn it! What am I doing?!
288
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,840
I fell asleep at such
an important time!
289
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,100
Moreover, today is the day
of the bet!
290
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,930
Meanwhile, I don't even know where
that old lady Tsunade has gone to!
291
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,890
My training is not completed yet…
292
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:10,140
I've got to play it by ear
and rely on a one-shot deal!
293
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,680
Next time: "A Dubious Offer!
Tsunade's Choice"
//%
1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,220
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,160
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,030
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,100
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,240
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,520
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,530
Now
12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,380
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,790
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,290
I’m going to be Hokage!
20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,730
I won’t lose here!
21
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,130
Whatever! You can’t keep up
with my speed at all!
22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,100
U-!
23
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,610
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
24
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,380
Naruto Barrage!
25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,070
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
26
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,140
I’m…getting stronger!
27
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,280
Ohhhh!
28
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,680
Cha!
29
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,720
Nice one! You did it!
30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,290
T-That Naruto beat Kiba!
31
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,620
It’s a major upset…
32
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,520
Yup!
33
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,530
Yes!
34
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,570
Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!
35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,510
This medicine works really well!
36
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,680
Here! Do you want to
use it too, Sakura?
37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,480
Only your wounds heal
with such speed…Naruto.
38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,860
The power of Nine Tail never
cease to amaze me.
39
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,500
U-Umm...
40
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,850
T-This is…
41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,850
ointment for your wound,
42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
for you Kiba and Akamaru.
43
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,790
Rather than worrying about others,
44
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,860
it’s about time you worried
about yourself!
45
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,530
Kiba…
46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
There are only 6 people left…
47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,970
you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy,
and the Sand guy.
48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,140
Listen, Hinata…
49
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,340
If you pull that guy from Sand,
withdraw quickly.
50
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,650
And there’s one more…
51
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,180
Do the same if you get Neji, too.
52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,950
Withdraw quickly…
53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,890
That guy will be hard on you.
54
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,290
He will destroy you.
55
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,090
Well, let’s announce the next match.
56
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,360
– Huh? 					– Huh?
57
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,260
– What? 					– Huh?
58
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,970
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
59
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,410
Hinata…
60
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,710
This is going to be an interesting match…
61
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,630
I never thought that I would
have a fight with you…
62
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,230
Lady Hinata.
63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,800
Brother Neji…
64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,370
Brother?
65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
Huh?!
66
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,770
Those two are siblings?
67
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,510
They’re descended from
68
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,580
one of the most honorable
old families in the Hidden Leaf…
69
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,150
The Hyuga Clan.
70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,160
But, they’re not siblings.
71
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,590
Then, how are they related?
72
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,530
Well, the relation of a head family
and branch family…
73
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,530
That may be an appropriate
way to say it.
74
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,940
Head family and branch family?
75
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,200
Yes!
76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,410
Hinata is from the head family.
77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
In other words, a person from
the main household
78
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,080
and Neji is from a branch family
that is descended from that family.
79
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,520
In other words,
it’s a fight between relatives.
80
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,190
It must be uneasy for both of them…
81
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,120
Yes.
82
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,490
However…
83
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,320
Huh? What is it?
84
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,560
I’ve heard that from long ago,
85
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,690
there’ve been various incidents between
the head family and branch family,
86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,660
and now their relationship
isn’t on very good terms.
87
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,530
Hmmm.
88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,600
Why?
89
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,530
I don’t know the details either.
90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,500
Only…
91
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,570
The so-called distinguished Ninja clans
like Uchiha and Hyuga
92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,010
have special techniques and
abilities that run in the family.
93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,510
It seems that the Hyuga household
laid down rules
94
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,680
for communicating those techniques…
95
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,190
It seems that there are many rules
that favor the head family…
96
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,520
– Huh? 					– Huh?
97
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,660
And there have been
various incidents
98
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,730
between the head family and
branch family due to those rules.
99
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,830
So this is a confrontation billed
as a clash of fate…
100
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,640
Oh, it’s gonna begin.
101
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,350
Start the battle please!
102
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,880
Just one thing before we square off
against each other in the fight…
103
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,020
I should advise you, Lady Hinata.
104
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,190
Withdraw!
105
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,920
You’re not suited to being a Shinobi.
106
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,100
You’re too nice.
107
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,530
You wish for harmony and
avoid conflict,
108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,640
you’re open to going with
the thinking of others.
109
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,470
And, you have no confidence
in yourself.
110
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,310
You’re always feeling inferior…
111
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,510
You thought it’s a good idea
to stay Genin.
112
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,820
However, you can’t register for
the Chunin test without three members…
113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,620
So you couldn’t turn down when Kiba
and the other proposed it and,
114
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,060
the truth is, you entered
the exam reluctantly.
115
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,660
Is that wrong?!
116
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,460
T-That’s wrong…
117
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,660
That’s not true…
118
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,200
I…
119
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,070
I only…
120
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,040
I wanted to change that about myself…
121
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,940
So I proposed it myself…
122
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,980
Hinata…
123
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,320
Stand up, Hanabi!
124
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,630
From now on, I’ll keep Hinata
under my wing…
125
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,800
But is that really okay?
126
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,440
Hinata should be the heir to
the Hyuga clan…
127
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,510
But, there is always death involved
with the job of Genin.
128
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,510
Do what you want.
129
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,520
She’s a failure who’s inferior even to her
younger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.
130
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,720
We don’t need her here
in Hyuga clan…
131
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,430
Is that all you have to say?
132
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,530
If so, leave!
133
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,970
You’re in the way!
134
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,500
Yes.
135
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,950
Hinata is trying to change
herself in her own way.
136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,600
Lady Hinata…
137
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,070
You are a spoiled one of
the head family.
138
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,040
People can never change!
139
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,980
A failure will always be a failure…
140
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,510
That personality and strength
won’t change.
141
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,550
That guy…
142
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,830
Since people don’t change,
differences exist among them…
143
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,530
and expressions like “elite”
and “failure” are born.
144
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,230
Everyone judges and are judged
145
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,500
based on the value of their face and
brain, ability and body type,
146
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,910
good and bad points of
their personalities.
147
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,180
People have to suffer and live
148
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,280
within the means of the
elements they cannot change.
149
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,520
Just like the fact that I’m from a
branch family
150
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,950
and you’re from the head family,
151
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,520
these things can’t change.
152
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,530
I’ve seen everything with
this Byakugan.
153
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,460
That’s why I understand!
154
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,530
You’re just talking tough.
155
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,440
You’re really thinking that you’d
like to run away from this place…
156
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,670
T-That’s wrong…
157
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,370
I really…
158
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,570
Byakugan?
159
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,940
It’s said that if you trace
the Uchiha Clan’s history,
160
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,780
the clan’s ability has its source
in Hyuga clan.
161
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,620
The Byakugan is one of the
Hyuga clan’s Kekkei Genkai,
162
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,120
a Visual Jutsu similar
to Sharingan…
163
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,990
However, with the ability of insight alone…
164
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,360
it gets the better of Sharingan.
165
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,110
Byakugan!
166
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,310
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
167
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,930
My eyes can’t be deceived.
168
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,730
Just now from my pressure,
169
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,510
your line of sight was pushed
to the upper left.
170
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,240
This is the sign that you're recalling
your past experience…
171
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,410
your bitter past.
172
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,950
And soon after that, your line of sight
moved to the bottom right…
173
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,920
This is the sign that you're imagining
physical and mental suffering.
174
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,520
That means…
175
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,390
you’re picturing your old self,
176
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,260
and from all of your experiences
up until now,
177
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,560
you’re imagining the result
of this battle…
178
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,270
The image of you losing!
179
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,980
Even the act of propping your arms
in front of your body…
180
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,820
It’s a gesture that means
181
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,990
you want to build a wall
between us and keep distant.
182
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,920
And that reflects your mind...
183
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,030
that you don’t want any more
of your deepest feelings to be raided…
184
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,930
Because everything I’ve said
is right on the mark, right?
185
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,600
Furthermore…
186
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,640
Laying a finger on your lips,
187
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,140
that too, is a self-familiarizing act
which represents a sense of panic.
188
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,810
It represents a defense instinct--
189
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,320
you want to alleviate the tension
and unease.
190
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,550
In other words…
191
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,360
deep in your heart,
you know it’s true, don’t you?
192
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,530
Changing yourself,
is something you absolutely can’t--!
193
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,530
Sure, she can!
194
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,140
You don’t have the privilege of
deciding what a person is like, stupid!
195
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,510
Give it to him, Hinata!
196
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,610
Naruto…
197
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Hinata!
198
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,060
Don’t just take it!
Argue back!
199
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,330
I’m getting irritated watching this!
200
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,510
Naruto…
201
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,820
What an annoying guy!
202
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,660
Naruto…
203
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,530
Thank you!
204
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,930
The expression of her eyes
has changed…
205
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
So you’re not going to withdraw?
206
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,770
I ‘m not taking responsibility
for what happens!
207
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,840
I…
208
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,850
I won’t run away!
209
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,510
I don’t…
210
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,520
I don’t change my words…
211
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,520
That’s my Way of Ninja!
212
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,050
...want to run anymore!
213
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,620
Byakugan!
214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Brother Neji!
215
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,640
I challenge you!
216
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,510
T-That is…
217
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,380
Fine…
218
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,530
Of course, the same Hyuga style…
219
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,260
Her pose is very similar
to Neji’s.
220
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Hyuga style?
221
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,530
The strongest Taijutsu style
in the Village Hidden in the Leaf…
222
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,200
Huh?
223
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,300
I said it before...
224
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,440
The man who is most likely
225
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,540
the strongest Genin of Hidden
Leaf Village is on my team…
226
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,080
That’s…
227
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,410
That guy, Neji Hyuga.
228
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,230
Here!
229
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,500
Did it go in?!
230
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,610
No…it was shallow!
231
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,740
No. Even a graze works.
232
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,310
That’s the reason that the Hyuga clan
233
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,580
is called the Hidden Leaf’s
distinguished family.
234
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,720
Huh? What do you mean?
235
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,620
The Hyuga has a particular
Taijutsu passed down through generations.
236
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,690
It’s not like the kind of Taijutsu that
Lee and I are good at…
237
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,270
Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,
238
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,070
is mainly to inflict external damage
on our enemy,
239
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,140
like broken bones and surface wounds.
240
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,510
In contrast, the Hyuga’s Taijutsu
inflict damage
241
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,940
on the Chakra Network through
which Chakra flow through the body,
242
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,910
and damaging the insides,
namely, it destroys internal organs.
243
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,350
They possess the Gentle Fist.
244
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,190
It’s not spectacular to watch…
245
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,520
but later it slowly takes effect.
246
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,930
Well, you can’t train the internal organs…
247
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,230
Even if you were really robust,
248
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,360
one hit from it would be
a deadly blow…
249
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,410
Even I can…
250
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,510
Hinata’s on the offensive…
251
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
Hinata…
252
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,220
Way to go, Hinata!
253
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,520
To attack the Chakra Network…
254
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,530
What are they, those people…?
255
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,960
Hey!
256
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,700
Hey!
257
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,530
Chakra Network, what’s that?!
258
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,930
Here we go again…
259
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,500
a question from a stupid guy.
260
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,500
I’ll explain.
261
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,670
They’re like blood canals.
262
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,140
In the same way that blood flows
through vessels throughout the body,
263
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,180
They’re bundles of canals that take
Chakra’s into every corner of your body…
264
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,850
Oh!
265
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,350
Like a path for Chakras, huh?
266
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,290
Yes…
267
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,420
Furthermore, the Chakra Network
is closely connected
268
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,530
with the internal organs which
enfold Chakra within the body.
269
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,530
That’s why if
the Chakra Network is attacked
270
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,930
the internal organs also suffer damage.
271
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,270
Huh, you know a lot, don’t 'ya?
272
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,770
Hey you!
That's no way to talk to your senior!
273
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,850
It’s no wonder…
274
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,020
Lee’s greatest long-standing enemy.
275
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,450
That’s…
276
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,290
him.
277
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,220
Sensei…
278
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,530
But, how can they do that?
279
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,560
After all, the Chakra Network
isn’t visible to the eyes.
280
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,530
How do they attack the Chakra
line inside the body?
281
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,870
No.
282
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,940
The eyes of those two…
283
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,510
They can see it with
their Byakugan.
284
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,850
And a Gentle Fist attack is a little
different from a regular attack.
285
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,520
They release their own Chakra
286
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,230
from a Chakra opening in their hand
and screw it into their opponent’s body.
287
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,060
It directly inflicts damage on
your enemy’s Chakra Network.
288
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,900
All right!
289
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Has she done it?
290
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,860
Hey, can you hear it?
291
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:34,440
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
292
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:44,010
The ocean spans limitlessly
293
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,320
Please keep that smile on your face forever
294
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,900
Or else I’ll cry
295
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,100
You won't have to search around you
296
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,640
It’s all ok now.
297
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:15,510
Everyone is inside
this hand
298
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,050
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
299
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,520
When you forget what happiness is
300
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,430
Just sing.
301
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,700
Light is born, and darkness was born
302
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,030
The two are one
303
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,470
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
304
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,980
Hey, can you hear it?
305
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,150
Amazing!
306
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,350
That Hinata!
307
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,560
She’s always melancholy
and wishy-washy and…
308
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,690
I thought she is kinda weird, yet…
309
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,230
Even when she gets blow after blow,
she gets back up and goes.
310
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,530
There’s something about
her way of fighting.
311
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,730
Just a feeling,
but she resembles you, I think.
312
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,200
Resembles me?
Hinata resembles me?
313
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,100
Now that I think about it, that girl,
she was always watching you.
314
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,740
Huh?
315
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,870
Next episode: “A Failure Stands Tall!”
316
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,070
Hinata, fight!
//%
1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,490
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,390
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,500
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,260
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,440
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,470
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,750
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,320
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,850
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,860
It will come, closer
11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,860
Now
12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,140
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,610
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,440
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,850
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,620
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,950
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,360
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,780
Umm, where’s the room
that Sasuke’s in?
20
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,190
Mr. Sasuke is not allowed
any visitors.
21
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,860
What?! Hey, hey!
What's up with that?!
22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,460
I’m sorry,
those are the rules.
23
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,860
Why, Sis, tell me why?
24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,860
Naruto, this is a hospital.
Keep it down.
25
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,200
Say! Say!
I've got a favor to ask!
26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
You don’t need to say it all.
27
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,200
Well, I thought it would
come to this so…
28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,610
I searched for someone
to watch your training.
29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,970
Why?!
30
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,110
I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
31
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,410
I have some matters
to take care of.
32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,950
I don’t have time to
trouble myself with you.
33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,690
Oh! Aha...!
34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,860
You’re going to
train Sasuke, aren’t you?!
35
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,720
Well... don't say that.
36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,260
I found a sensei who’s
more reliable than I am!
37
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,260
Well…who is it?
38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
It’s me!
39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,030
Huh?!
40
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,230
Oh!
41
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,100
You!
42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,900
The Closet Perv!
43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,200
Such insolence!
44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Ebisu Returns:
Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!
45
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,750
Ebisu Sensei is
a Closet Perv?
46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,930
Why’s this guy
my training teacher?!
47
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,930
In the first place,
he’s weaker than me!
48
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,900
What did you say?
49
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,070
But you see! But you see!
50
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,900
A long time ago,
with my Harem Jutsu, this guy…
51
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,400
Transform!
52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,610
Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!
53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,650
B-By any chance…
54
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,020
Harem Jutsu?
55
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,860
U-Uh…it’s nothing!
56
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,060
I’ll treat you to and buy you
whatever you want later!
57
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,860
Just be quiet about that!
58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,100
You better.
59
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,370
Wow, I didn’t know you
were acquainted.
60
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,840
Well, they’re unsavory ties, but.
61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,840
How could I ever forget
that humiliation?
62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,010
But why this guy?
63
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,650
I definitely don’t want him to.
64
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,050
Same here.
65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,850
If it weren’t Kakashi’s favor,
who’d teach you for the fun of it?
66
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,860
Then don’t.
67
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,320
Now now, both of you…
68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,890
Don’t say that.
69
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,930
Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor
70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,870
who teaches the elite,
a special Jonin!
71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,440
He’s truly better
at teaching than I am.
72
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,410
Well, Naruto, of the three kids
in Squad Seven that I taught,
73
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,850
you’re the worst at the basic skills.
74
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,450
Get taught with care
this time around.
75
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,560
How the heck am I inferior
compared to Sakura and Sasuke?!
76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,760
Naruto, it’s fact that you
don’t have the fundamentals down.
77
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,930
No matter what you do,
the basic skills are important.
78
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,840
If you really want to become strong,
just be quiet and listen to what I say.
79
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,440
Now then, Ebisu Sensei,
I’m leaving him with you.
80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,850
Yes, yes.
81
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,450
Dang it.
82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,850
It may appear to be harsh,
83
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,520
but you can become stronger
a lot more.
84
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,260
Do your best.
85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Okay, then, let’s go.
86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,530
Still, I’m not convinced…
87
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,530
Huh?
88
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,630
You see!
89
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,370
Fundamentals might be important,
90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,780
but I won’t get strong being taught
by someone weaker than me!
91
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,150
So in other words,
you want to say that I’m weak?
92
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,450
Who else is here?!
93
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,850
I was certainly surprised having
that indecent Jutsu used on me that time.
94
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,890
But it’s premature for you to
judge my ability on just that.
95
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,890
Even though you were
totally knocked out.
96
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Fine.
97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,870
Then, why don’t we put
it to the test?
98
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,700
Hmm?
99
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,370
Naruto, run.
100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Huh?
101
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,840
If you can get to outrun me,
I’ll back down quietly.
102
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,650
Back down…?
103
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,450
Yes.
104
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,980
And of course, I’ll speak to
Kakashi Sensei
105
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,720
about you receiving direct training.
106
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,220
What?! Really?!
107
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,190
This elite instructor does not
go back on his word.
108
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,760
However, this is only if
you can outrun me.
109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,700
Then that makes it easy!
110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,270
See ya!
111
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,980
This’ll be a snap, a snap!
112
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,620
I’ll lose that…
Closet Perv in no time!
113
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,130
He already can’t catch up!
114
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,400
I knew I was quite
an exceptional Ninja…
115
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,330
Who is exceptional, you say?
116
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,870
Surely you’re not thinking you can
outrun me with just that much.
117
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,810
W-What’re you saying?!
118
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,910
The chase has still…
119
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,420
only just begun!
120
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,000
Though he’s a Closet Perv,
121
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,500
he’s the elite tutor after all,
he’s good.
122
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,940
Now then.
123
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,910
I knew you were Closet Perv.
124
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,740
What are you doing…?
125
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,110
Naruto?
126
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,950
I see. The idea isn’t bad.
127
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,990
Then, how about this?!
128
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,820
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
129
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,000
Heh!
130
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,930
Catch me…if you can!
131
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,170
Not bad…
132
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,980
However, you are not the only one
who uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
133
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,980
I won’t let you get away!
134
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,290
Dang it!
135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
Son…of…a...!
136
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,920
Now then, next.
137
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,990
Hold it!
138
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,400
I found you!
139
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,330
Wait!
140
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,570
I won’t let you get away!
141
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
Get off!
142
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,570
There! No, actually, here!
143
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,770
Here!
144
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,980
There!
145
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,980
There!
146
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,440
Hold it!
147
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Have you reached your limit?
148
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,160
You’re freaking pesky!
149
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,330
Give it up already!
150
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,570
What are you snapping
back at me for?
151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,910
This is a chase, so chasing
is natural, right?
152
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,140
T-True enough…
153
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,950
Naruto, you have understood
my greatness by now, right?
154
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,150
It’s about time you surrendered
and moved on to training--
155
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,250
The heck with that!
156
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,190
I’m going to bump you off,
and receive Kakashi Sensei’s training!
157
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,830
Even if I have to knock you out!
158
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,900
It appears you still have
some spirit left.
159
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,010
To think he would come at me
head on, even though this is a chase.
160
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,140
Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.
161
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,750
As Kakashi said, he’s the
number one unpredictability Ninja.
162
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,310
Don’t take this badly!
163
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,320
Eat this!
164
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,150
Clone Jutsu…?
165
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,140
The game is over, Naruto!
166
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,170
Dang it!
167
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,120
Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles and
salt-flavor ramen noodles!
168
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,950
Here you go!
169
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,020
Naruto, having been shown
your movements and
170
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,430
having further analyzed
what Kakashi has told me…
171
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,470
it is clear that you cannot control
Chakra well.
172
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,270
Control…?
173
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,270
That’s right.
174
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,470
Now then, comparing you
with Sasuke and Sakura …
175
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,240
I shall explain your
bad points in order.
176
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,120
As you know, in the case of using
Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,
177
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,250
Ninjas build up Chakra and
activate the Jutsu.
178
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,220
I-I know that already!
179
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,090
Is that so?
180
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,760
Then, in the case of comparing
the three of you,
181
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,500
I shall explain specifically
how you are inferior.
182
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,370
That’s kind of an irritating
way of saying it.
183
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,440
I’m treating you the ramen
as promised,
184
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,770
so be quiet and listen!
185
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,780
First, let us say that Sakura
uses Clone Jutsu.
186
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,310
Clone Jutsu!
187
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,220
In her case, her build-up control as well as
her control of Chakra is perfect,
188
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,120
so she can make clones without
using wasteful energy.
189
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,260
Cha!
190
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,030
Next, in Sasuke’s case,
191
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,300
he is somewhat poor at
building up Chakra.
192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Clone Jutsu.
193
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,780
But, his control of Chakra is perfect,
194
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,210
so both he and Sakura can
make five clones.
195
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,620
But, he uses a bit more wasteful
Chakra than Sakura.
196
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,090
Oh!
197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,260
So Sasuke’s nothing special.
198
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,430
In your case, there’s no time
to be laughing at others.
199
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,290
Huh?
200
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,900
You are very poor at building up Chakra
and controlling it,
201
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,840
so you cannot make clones
with the same amount of Chakra.
202
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,040
In the case where you strain to
make clones despite that,
203
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,650
after consuming a much larger amount
of Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke…
204
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,150
Clone Jutsu!
205
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,490
...you can barely make
one clone at best.
206
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,490
By the way,
207
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,520
Sakura and Sasuke can become ten
with the same amount of Chakra.
208
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,470
Like this, the three of you are
this different even using the same Jutsu.
209
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,380
Well, this is a somewhat exaggerated
comparison of you three,
210
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,280
but you build up too much Chakra,
use too much physical strength,
211
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,480
and your Jutsu activation is also unstable.
212
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,820
But, there’ve been times when
I was greater than Sakura and Sasuke…
213
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,290
That’s only because you
happen to have
214
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,160
the most outstanding stamina
of the three!
215
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,530
Well, I am pretty sure that
your Chakra control
216
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,170
is getting difficult due to the influence
of the Nine-Tails…
217
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,500
which is the origin of your stamina.
218
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,380
Anyway, there is no mistaking
that you can become strong
219
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,740
if you carry out the training
we will be doing from now.
220
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,480
Huh?! Really?!
221
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,680
I guarantee it.
222
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,820
Now then, let’s go.
223
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,850
Sir, your bill.
224
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,650
Oh, that’s right.
225
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,960
Wha--?!
226
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,160
Thank you very much!
227
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,480
We’ve come quite a long way…
228
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,880
But, this is a hot spring town, right?
229
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,620
It doesn’t look like we’ve come
here to leisurely soak in a hot spring…
230
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,490
Hey! Naruto!
231
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,990
That’s the women’s bath!
232
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,490
I simply will not allow
indecent behavior!
233
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,160
Huh?
234
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,990
I’m not you…
235
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,060
It’s not that I was trying to peep.
Believe it!
236
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,400
Thinking of something like that
in the first place makes you a Closet Perv!
237
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,570
What’s with that look?
238
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,270
N-Nothing.
239
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,480
More importantly, why’ve we come
to a place like this?!
240
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,180
Will soaking in a hot spring
do anything for training?
241
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,480
No!
242
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,850
The training will be here
in this hot spring area!
243
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,120
Okay, this is the place.
244
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,790
It’s a bath, sure enough!
245
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,700
What are you saying?
246
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,500
I said this is training, didn’t I?
Training!
247
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,430
We’re going to train here?
248
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,100
What the heck are we going to do?
249
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,640
Walk on this hot water!
250
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,880
What?!
251
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,250
What is it?
252
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,120
Walk on hot water?
253
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,350
Can you really do that?
254
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,620
Of course!
255
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,490
I heard from Kakashi Sensei.
256
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,560
You already did tree-climbing training
without using your hands, right?
257
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,430
It’s an application of that.
258
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,500
Hmm… 					What do you mean?
259
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,400
Besides, I don’t really remember
stuff from long ago!
260
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,470
In tree climbing, all you do
is accumulate
261
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,880
only the necessary amount of Chakra
in one necessary location
262
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,480
and maintain that amount of
Chakra all the while.
263
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,420
Trees are fixed objects,
so you only need to be attached to it.
264
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,850
In other words,
265
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,290
it’s training for building up
a fixed amount of Chakra.
266
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,620
To float on the surface of water,
267
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,860
you have to discharge on
a constant basis
268
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,260
an appropriate amount of Chakra
from your feet to the water
269
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,230
and balance that to the extent that
you can float your own body.
270
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,570
Huh?
271
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,070
This Chakra control is
more difficult than maintaining…
272
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,480
and is a control training for
discharge and usage of fixed amount
273
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,540
of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.
274
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,550
Hmm, I really don’t get it!
275
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,150
Well, it would be better to
show you in your case.
276
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,190
First, you build up Chakra
in your feet.
277
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,530
Then, while constantly discharging
a fixed amount…
278
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,030
you balance it with your body weight.
279
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,130
And…
280
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,970
well, this is how it goes.
281
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,470
Oh! Okay! 					I’m going to try!
282
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,680
First, you build up Chakra
in your feet.
283
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Then!
284
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,010
Discharge a fixed amount. Right?
285
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,180
Oh!
286
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
I knew it.
287
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,690
Hot-hot-hot-hot!
288
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,220
I forgot to mention it,
but this hot water is 60° C.
289
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,520
If you do nothing but fail…
290
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,690
you will become a boiled octopus!
291
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,100
Dang it!
292
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,500
I’ll do it no matter what!
293
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,620
You’re unusually spirited today,
honored grandson!
294
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,990
My principle of guidance
has finally gotten through!
295
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,760
This would ordinarily be the
time to go carry out
296
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,760
a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.
297
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I’ve stopped doing that now!
298
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,300
That’s right!
299
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,370
So you have finally understood.
300
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,810
That the shortcut to becoming
the Hokage is to do as I say…
301
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,510
There are no shortcuts!
302
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,710
Huh?
303
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,750
Brother Naruto said it…
304
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,690
If you’re to become Hokage,
be prepared for that!
305
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,090
Oh!
306
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,200
I’m starting to get it!
307
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,300
To think he would get the
hang of the Chakra control this quickly…
308
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,670
I never thought,
you would grow this much.
309
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,110
Indeed, there are no shortcuts,
in anything…
310
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,680
It appears I had the
wrong idea about you…
311
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,320
You are a much smarter teacher
than I am.
312
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,690
And, you were not just a Demon Fox…
313
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,790
You were a splendid
Hidden Leaf Village Ninja!
314
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,030
Oh! Hot!
315
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,700
Hm?! That is…!
316
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,410
Humph! I don’t know who you are
or where you’re from, but…
317
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,480
I will not allow indecency!
318
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Man…
319
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,250
T-That is!
320
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,050
What?!
321
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,030
Don’t make a ruckus.
322
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,670
Jeez, it won’t do to be found out!
323
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,440
The Closet Perv lost?
324
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,110
W-What’s with that
Shameless Perv?!
325
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,530
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
326
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,770
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
327
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,410
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
328
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,680
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
329
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,080
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
330
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,460
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
331
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,200
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
332
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,640
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
333
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,840
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
334
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,280
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me your hand!
335
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,550
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
336
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,830
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
337
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,500
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
338
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:43,670
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
339
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you!
340
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,220
What’re you doing,
Shameless Perv?!
341
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,690
Here I was having my training watched,
and you did this to the Closet Perv!
342
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,690
And you’re so infernally
quick at running away.
343
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,700
Could he be a super Ninja?
344
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,700
Next episode.
“Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!”
345
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,110
I’ll chase him down and make him
train me without fail!
346
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,090
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
347
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,690
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
//%
1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,620
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,560
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,630
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,430
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,600
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,880
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,480
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,920
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,920
It will come, closer
11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,930
Now
12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,370
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,840
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,680
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,080
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,850
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,190
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,590
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,020
Hey… Closet pervert.
20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,930
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu…
21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,630
One Thousand Years of Death!
22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,770
He’s totally knocked out…
He’s weak, sure enough.
23
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,680
What’s with that big frog?
What the heck are you?
24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,550
Thank you for asking me!
25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,560
Know me as the Mountain Toad…
spirit sage who acquires immortality,
26
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,890
also commonly called the
Toad Mountain Sage.
27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,930
Long Time No See:
Jiraiya Returns!
28
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,000
M-Mountain Sage?
29
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,270
Exactly.
30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,910
Hey…Pervy Sage,
what’re you going to do about this?
31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,520
Here, he was supposed to
watch my training.
32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,920
You did that to him.
33
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,250
He interfered with my research.
34
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,560
Research?
35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,930
I’m a writer.
I’m writing a novel.
36
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,930
This is it.
37
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,260
Make-Out Paradise
38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,910
Oh, that is…!
39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,940
You know this?
40
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,310
I’ve gotten quite famous.
41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,710
That’s not much of a novel!
42
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,250
In the first place,
what research you are talking about?
43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,720
You’re just peeking at the girls’ bath!
44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,920
– Yikes! 					– No!
45
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,460
Idiot, idiot…idiot!
My peeking has been found out.
46
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,960
You pervert.
47
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,760
F-Fool! I’m not just a pervert.
48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,270
I get inspired by peeking
and can write better pieces.
49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,940
Liar! No excuses.
50
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,040
More importantly, what’re you
going to do about my training?
51
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,410
You mean the walking-on-water technique
you were doing earlier?
52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,810
You know it?
53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,090
Then take responsibility
and join my training.
54
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,090
Humph. I don’t care about such things.
55
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,330
Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!
56
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,260
Join my training, hey!
57
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,000
Shut up! I hate people who
don’t know how to talk properly…
58
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,300
And I don’t like men.
59
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,040
Oh, umm, umm…
60
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,310
That Make-Out Paradise was
really exciting, cool and interesting.
61
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,920
The purchase or viewing of that novel is
prohibited for those 18 years or younger…
62
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
You liar.
63
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,920
The reviews that I‘ve heard are great.
64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,190
It’s useless to flatter me.
I’m a sage!
65
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,800
I’m not the type of fool who can
be coaxed by a fledgling like you.
66
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,030
Oh, hey…wait!
67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,870
Farewell, kid.
68
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,210
Wow! He’s cool even
though he’s a pervert.
69
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,390
Heeey, Pervy Sage!
70
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,930
Where’d he go?
71
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,900
What’re you doing,
you old pervert?
72
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,550
No, no, I’m sorry, miss…
but what lovely breasts…
73
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,910
Pervert!
74
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,890
This grown-up is disgraceful.
75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,090
Maybe there’s nothing special about him,
after all.
76
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,930
But there’s nobody else.
77
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,930
Good grief…
78
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,300
As usual, the women in
this village are strong-minded.
79
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,370
However, that’s makes them so good.
80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,440
“As usual”?
Meaning you’ve come here before?
81
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,340
You.
82
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,940
And you did nothing but peeping, right…?
83
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,410
You Pervy Sage!
84
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,180
Don’t say pervert, pervert
in such a loud voice.
85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,750
Shut up!
86
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,220
So I bet that one shot on
the closet pervert was a fluke…
87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,790
Anyway, I’ll have you take responsibility
for ruining my training! Whoa…
88
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,130
Jeez, you’re a noisy brat.
89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,930
Hey!
90
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,270
Be quiet inside here for awhile.
91
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,970
Hey! Let me out, you jerk!
92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I want to have a romantic encounter
with a stacked girl.
93
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,420
How dare you do that to me earlier!
94
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,550
Substitution Jutsu.
95
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,960
Sure enough,
he’s not an ordinary old man.
96
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,930
Humph! That punk…
97
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,340
It’s a million years too soon
for that kid to take me on.
98
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,310
Not really.
99
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,910
It seems you have a bit of talent.
100
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,180
Then you’ll watch my training?
101
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,920
Give and take!
102
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,020
I'm not averse to listening
to your favor
103
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,890
as long as you listen to mine.
104
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,060
So which is it?
105
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,260
Listen up…
106
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,970
Nice ripe fruit that looks like this,
like this and this.
107
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,940
I’ll watch your training
if you bring me that.
108
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,170
You really will, right?
109
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,740
This Toad Mountain Sage doesn’t lie.
110
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,740
Okay, wait!
111
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,960
Plans are plans.
They don't necessarily have to happen…
112
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,960
Hello there, you ladies!
113
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,910
Oh my… You’re funny, old man.
114
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,910
No-no, this is the solemn truth.
115
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,250
Yeah, and then,
what happened then?
116
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,750
Hey, Pervy Sage!
117
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,250
Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.
118
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,560
You fool! Who’s a Pervy Sage?
119
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,930
I brought the promised item.
120
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,160
Nice ripe fruit..
121
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,500
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!
That’s not IT!
122
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,010
Looks good!
123
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,810
Don't hesitate. Help yourself.
124
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,180
Thanks.
125
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,580
No!
126
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
Where’d the ladies go?!
127
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,930
I got my fill…
128
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,630
Ladies…
129
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,930
No doubt about it. That person is…
130
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,540
Good grief. I’ve wasted time…
131
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,350
Hold it! Where are you going?!
What about my training?!
132
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,920
I don’t care! My precious research
has been ruined thanks to you.
133
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,720
Research, my butt!
I can’t be standing around here, either!
134
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,730
I’m going to train hard,
become stronger than anybody,
135
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,560
pass the Chunin exam,
136
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,100
and then I’ll exceed the Hokage!
137
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,100
Humph! I don’t care about such things.
138
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,310
Here all you do is get in my way…
139
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,270
Jeez, what a repugnant brat!
140
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,910
Stacked girls like the ones
from earlier
141
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,280
are indispensable for
my great writing enterprises!
142
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,920
I see… So I should bring
some stacked girls, right?
143
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,920
Okay.
144
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,450
W-Wow…!
145
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,390
If you gaze at me like that…
I feel embarrassed.
146
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh…!
147
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,470
What a…
148
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,900
What a cute girl.
149
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,900
I like you!
150
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,910
You pass!
151
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Idiot.
152
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,850
You’re really my type of girl.
What’s that technique called?
153
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,350
It’s called Sexy Jutsu.
154
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,390
Oooh, what an idea. You’re a genius.
155
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,430
I get the feeling all adults are
really affected by this technique.
156
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,330
Then you’ll watch my training?
157
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,130
Sure! However, I have a condition.
158
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,540
A condition…? What is it?
159
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,850
A-Always be…in that form
when you’re in front of me!
160
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,930
Hey! Sure enough,
you’re just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!
161
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,930
No! I’m not just a pervert!
162
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,170
As if you didn’t know!
163
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,200
I’m a super pervert!
164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,210
Darn it… He’s gone defiant…
165
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,050
Well, brushing off the stuff until
now as a joke,
166
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,620
I’ll watch your training.
167
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,920
You mean it, right?
168
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,420
A sage doesn’t go back on his word.
169
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,390
Okay, kid.
170
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,630
Do that training that you were
doing before one more time.
171
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,430
Okay!
172
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,600
Okay.
173
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,170
Darn it.
174
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,540
Totally worthless.
175
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,740
Shut up!
176
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,910
It’s pointless to wear clothes.
177
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,620
Hey, build up your Chakra
one more time.
178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,250
One more time?
179
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,790
Just do it, quick.
180
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,160
You!
181
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,930
What?
182
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,930
You’re pretty sexy when
you’re naked.
183
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,510
Jeez. I’m concentrating,
so don’t interfere.
184
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,810
Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.
185
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,140
You’re messing with my focus.
186
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,470
I see…So this is The Seal Formula.
187
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,440
Two Tetragram Seals
making a Double Tetragram Seal…
188
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,510
Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?
189
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,380
Nine-Tailed Chakra is leaking
from between the Tetragram Seals…
190
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,580
and is fixed so that it
can return to this kid’s Chakra.
191
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,120
Fourth Hokage…
192
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,560
It’s to protect this kid, huh?
193
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,830
But after that, it’s stopped
with a Five-Pronged Seal…
194
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,170
Putting Odd-Numbered Seal
over Even-Number Seals…
195
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,600
This kid’s Chakra and that of
the Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled
196
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,970
and are not stable.
197
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,910
No wonder he is not able to
build up Chakra very well.
198
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,180
That tickles…old man.
199
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,750
Oh, sorry, sorry.
200
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,220
Perhaps someone else…did it…
201
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,920
The formula is rough.
202
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,760
Well, it’s probably Orochimaru.
203
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,340
Kid, give me a hurrah.
204
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,200
What?
205
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,470
Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.
206
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,180
Jeez, he’s demanding.
207
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,590
Five-Pronged Seal…Release!
208
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,040
What’re you doing?!
209
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,910
Well, I just pushed
the pressure points for relaxing.
210
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,920
Just try walking on
the water once more…
211
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,720
Sheesh!
212
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,190
What?
213
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,440
I don’t know why, but it’s going well!
214
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,910
Yahoo!
215
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,250
I guess it’s about time to teach him
how to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.
216
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,380
Okay, kid. Come on out.
217
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,090
I’ll teach you an ace technique.
218
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,920
What, what ace technique?
A deadly technique?
219
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,900
There’s something you need to
understand well
220
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,910
before I teach you techniques.
221
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,210
You probably haven’t noticed,
but you possess two types of Chakra.
222
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,250
Huh? Two types?
223
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,920
Until now, have you ever
felt a special Chakra?
224
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,920
Special? Hmm…
225
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,320
Come to think of it…
226
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,000
Come to think of it,
I get the feeling there were times when…
227
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,670
Chakra suddenly sprang up
and an awesome power came out.
228
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,440
But…I don’t really remember those moments.
229
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,940
I see.
230
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,340
But I do remember sensing that
it was different
231
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,850
from the Chakra I always build up.
232
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,910
If I liken it to colors,
233
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,620
while it’s always blue…
234
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,850
it felt like it was red or something.
235
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,590
I see.
236
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,700
Okay. That’s it for today’s training.
237
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,170
What?! Already?
238
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,940
What happened to the ace technique?
239
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,910
I can still train.
240
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,380
With training, a watched pot never boils.
241
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,520
As long as we’re here,
let’s have a bath…
242
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,250
Not just falling in…
243
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,870
Warms me up.
244
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,910
A drink after training’s the best.
245
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,080
Say, say, Pervy Sage.
246
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,310
What kind of technique is
that ace technique?
247
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,080
You’ll find out tomorrow.
248
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,920
Miser!
249
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,760
We’ll turn into boiled frogs if
we stay in here too long.
250
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,830
Ebisu, sorry for snatching
your student.
251
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,170
It’s okay. More importantly,
I was surprised…
252
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,900
The Hokage has had us searching
all over for you
253
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,370
and we could never determine
your whereabouts.
254
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,210
To think you were in this village…
255
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,510
The Hokage will be pleased.
256
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,850
Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?
257
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,720
Not yet.
258
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,920
I see. That’s for the best.
259
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,060
Sure enough, something
about Orochimaru?
260
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,190
No, unfortunately not.
261
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,990
What?
262
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,830
I just stopped by looking
for material for my novel…
263
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,230
My nature is not to get myself
involved in trouble.
264
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,370
What are you saying?!
You should know!
265
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,910
What is necessary to stop Orochimaru,
known as one of the Sannin,
266
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,480
the legendary three Shinobi,
267
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,910
is the power of another Sannin!
268
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,680
Your power, Master Jiraiya!
269
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,050
First, I need to sign this contract
270
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,930
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
271
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,340
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
272
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,910
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
273
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,080
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
274
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:45,620
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
275
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:52,920
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
276
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,840
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
277
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,040
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
278
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,510
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
279
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,910
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
280
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,950
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
281
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:30,460
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
282
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,930
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
283
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:44,170
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
284
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,480
First, I need to sign this contract
in blood
285
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,250
and mark it with the fingerprints
of one hand.
286
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,020
Then I build up my Chakra.
287
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,930
The Hand Signs are
Dog-Boar-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
288
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,330
Then I must place my contract hand
on the place where I want to summon it!
289
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,930
How's that?!
290
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,810
Next time, "The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!"
291
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,540
What is this?!
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,060
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,120
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,310
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,480
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,820
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,250
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
20
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,420
Withdraw! You’re not suited
to being a Shinobi.
21
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,830
You don’t have the privilege of
deciding what a person is like, stupid!
22
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,400
Hinata, give it to him!
23
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,500
Naruto…
24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,740
Don’t just take it! Argue back!
25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,270
I’m getting irritated watching this!
26
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,950
Naruto...
27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,650
Thank you!
28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,550
The expression of her eyes
has changed...
29
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,890
So you're not going to withdraw?
30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
I’m not taking responsibility
for what happens…
31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,730
I don’t want to run away!
32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,500
Byakugan!
33
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,930
Brother Neji! I challenge you!
34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,150
Here!
35
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,560
A Failure Stands Tall!
36
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,570
As I thought, this is the extent of it…
37
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,540
the head family’s power!
38
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,840
What the--?!
39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,010
But Hinata laid a perfect strike!
40
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,050
N-Not yet…
41
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,730
What's with this guy…!
42
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,560
I-It can't be….
43
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,770
Well, now….
44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,770
I guess this is why he's called
the most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.
45
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,690
Y-You mean… All this time…?
46
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,560
That's right! I can see
the Chakra Points.
47
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
W-What is he talking about?!
48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,800
On the Chakra Network…
49
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,510
there are 361 energy centers
or Chakra opening,
50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,510
each about the size
of the head of a pin.
51
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,840
They're called Chakra Points.
52
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:07,720
Theoretically, hitting one directly
can halt or increase Chakra flow,
53
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,560
enabling one to gain complete control over
an opponent's flow of Chakra.
54
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,590
Just so you know,
55
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,500
not even my Sharingan
can see Chakra Points!
56
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,530
Having the penetrating eye
is one thing,
57
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,540
but to hit it so accurately like
that during a match,
58
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,540
well, that's just…
59
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,180
Lady Hinata...
60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,190
What we have here is an unchangeable
difference in abilities.
61
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,260
It's what distinguishes
the elite from the failure.
62
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
It is brute, unalterable fact.
63
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,070
You were destined to regret having said
64
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,540
that you don't want to run anymore,
the instant you said it.
65
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,340
And now, you must have
abandoned yourself to despair!
66
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,110
This is your ultimatum…
67
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,650
Withdraw!
68
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,180
I-I...
69
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I-I meant it...
70
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,430
and am…sticking by…
71
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,530
every word...
72
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,770
Hinata…
73
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,670
I said!
74
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm not gonna run away!
75
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,180
Because that's…my Way of Ninja!
76
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,440
I had no idea... Hinata was this tough…
77
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,750
She's a lot like you.
78
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,520
Come to think of it…
She's always watching you.
79
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,180
Huh?
80
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,890
Hinata…
81
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,570
Bring it on!
82
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,810
She has reached her limit.
83
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,180
One more blow and…
84
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,130
Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points
85
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,130
have completely halted
her flow of Chakra.
86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,530
That means she can no longer
send Chakra
87
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,170
into her opponent's body
to fight in the Gentle Fist.
88
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
This match is as good as over.
89
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,680
But I never imagined there would
be someone this powerful…
90
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,550
I'm afraid even our Sasuke
is no match for him.
91
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,350
It looks as if Neji may very well
take this Exam.
92
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,560
It's going to take more than what
this girl has to bring him down.
93
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,670
L-Look at those eyes…
94
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,980
Is he going to try to kill her?
No, no, that's absurd.
95
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,610
Doesn't it seem that…
96
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,550
Neji’s strength is somehow
against the rules?
97
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,480
He's just too powerful…
98
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,850
I mean it!
99
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,390
Go, Hinata!
100
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,760
Naruto...
101
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Strength has come back
into her eyes…
102
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,300
I've been watching you…
103
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,610
I've been watching you closely
for many years now!
104
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,550
Why I wonder…?
105
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,720
Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!
106
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,460
What a pain!
107
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,430
It's all your fault!
108
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,930
Like I care!
109
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,600
Okay!
110
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,270
Naruto… d-do your best.
111
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,840
Transformation!
112
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,680
I don't know why, but…
113
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,520
I am Naruto Uzumaki!
114
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,590
I'm not about to lose to
the likes of any of you!
115
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,560
Is that perfectly clear?!
116
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,470
I'm not about to lose to
the likes of any of you? Yeah, right!
117
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,710
That idiot.
118
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,310
He made a roomful of enemies
in the space of an instant.
119
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,180
When I watch Naruto...
120
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,550
Naruto, stand up!
121
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,570
If you compete with me
for the name of Hokage…
122
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,540
You… will be the loser!
123
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,270
I can feel courage welling up.
124
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,110
I feel that I can hang on,
that I can do it…
125
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,920
that I too am worth something!
126
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,890
Oh!
127
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,320
– No! 					– Hinata!
128
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,800
Hinata...
129
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,770
At some point, Hinata, who was
in the habit of just giving up,
130
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,340
made up her mind to change.
131
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,380
Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.
132
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,820
She put every ounce of
her being into her training.
133
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,750
I saw it with my own eyes.
134
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,300
But even so, she continued
to fail all her missions.
135
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,610
She lost her nerve when
faced with real competition
136
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,970
and became easily discouraged.
137
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,550
But today's Hinata is different.
138
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,020
I have never…
139
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,390
seen…that look in her eyes before.
140
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,060
Naruto.
141
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,030
I have always done
the watching up to now,
142
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,100
but, now, finally…
143
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,570
finally, I am…
144
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,100
Naruto!
145
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,980
You just don't get it, do you?
146
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,620
Your strikes were ineffective
from the very first.
147
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,990
It's the end.
148
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,560
Hinata… That's enough.
149
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
You lost the match,
150
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,570
but you've become a new person
in the process.
151
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,800
You did well.
152
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
I want to change that about myself…
153
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,340
So I proposed it myself…
154
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,620
Neji's final blow went
straight for the heart.
155
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,490
I feel sorry for her,
156
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,550
but she won't be standing
again now.
157
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,540
As further fighting is not feasible
under these conditions…
158
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,510
Don't stop it!
159
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,180
Don't stop the match!
Believe it!
160
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,710
Naruto, stop!
161
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,550
What on earth are you saying, stupid!
162
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,550
She's had it. You can see
she's unconscious…
163
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,350
Huh?
164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,400
Why do you stand up?
165
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,540
If you continue like this,
you’ll really die!
166
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,270
He is now finally for
the first time truly seeing me.
167
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,680
I will not be caught looking bad...
168
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,650
Why?!
169
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,150
in front of...
170
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,750
the person I admire most.
171
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,260
I-I am far from finished!
172
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,670
Give up the bravado…
173
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,240
I can tell you're just
barely standing.
174
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,540
You've shouldered the lot
of having been born
175
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,880
to the head family line of the Hyuga…
176
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,880
And cursed and blamed
yourself for being weak...
177
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,480
But, people cannot change.
178
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,390
That's just the way it is.
179
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,820
There is no need for you
to suffer any more!
180
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,460
Surrender to it!
181
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,760
You're wrong... Brother Neji.
182
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,600
Because I can tell…
183
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,540
that you are suffering
much more than I.
184
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,910
What?!
185
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,540
You are the one who is torn up
186
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,550
over the fate of head
and branch family.
187
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,560
Neji, the match has been called!
188
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
Oh boy!
189
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,540
Neji, get a hold of yourself!
190
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,910
You promised me
191
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,310
you wouldn't let the head family
thing get you riled up!
192
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,980
Why are all the other Jonin
butting in?!
193
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,180
The head family gets
special treatment, eh?
194
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,550
Hinata?!
195
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,150
Hinata!
196
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,190
Hinata!
197
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,960
Hinata!
198
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,030
Hinata! Are you okay?!
199
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,260
Hey!
200
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,900
Naruto…
201
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.
202
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,540
I…
203
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,150
Do you think…
204
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,850
I…changed maybe a little bit?
205
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,560
Hey you, failure!
206
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,060
I have two pieces
of advice for you.
207
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,430
First, if you intend to
call yourself a Shinobi,
208
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,400
stop that revolting cheering of yours.
209
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,070
And the second...
210
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,710
a failure will always be a failure.
211
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,580
There's no changing that!
212
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,610
Do you want to see about that?
213
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,830
You!
214
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,960
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.
215
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,470
But all fighting must be
done officially in a match!
216
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,610
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort…
217
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,540
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?
218
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,810
Though, I am probably going
to be the one fighting Neji…
219
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,220
but it would be okay with me
if you ended up fighting him, Naruto.
220
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,960
All right already.
221
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,000
So this is okay then,
right, Guy Sensei?
222
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,530
Lee! You….
223
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,940
Nice going!
224
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,420
Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.
225
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,120
Was he trying to kill her then?!
226
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
The precious little time you have
would be better spent
227
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
seeing to her than glaring at me.
228
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,960
Medics!
229
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,570
Hurry! What's taking so long?!
230
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,770
S-Sorry.
231
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,540
Get her on the stretcher.
One, two, three.
232
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,440
It's serious. She 's got about
10 minutes at the most!
233
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,710
Get her to the emergency room.
Pronto!
234
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,980
Out of the way!
235
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,370
Hinata…
236
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,850
Because that's my Way of Ninja.
237
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,560
I promise you.
238
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,220
I will win no matter what!
239
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,560
Hey, can you hear it?
240
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:32,970
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
241
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:42,550
The ocean spans limitlessly
242
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:50,850
Please keep that smile on your face forever
243
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,560
Or else I’ll cry
244
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,630
You won't have to search around you
245
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,440
It’s all ok now.
246
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:14,240
Everyone is inside
this hand
247
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,620
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
248
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,190
When you forget what happiness is
249
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,960
Just sing.
250
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,460
Light is born, and darkness was born
251
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,570
The two are one
252
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:42,010
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
253
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Hey, can you hear it?
254
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,020
The Absolute Defense of the Sand?
255
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,720
They say no one has
ever injured Gaara.
256
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,420
He's strong as heck and
has no weak points.
257
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,760
Bushy-Brows is no match for him…
258
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,730
But wait, he's not losing!
259
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,700
He seems a lot faster than before.
260
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,560
Is this due to his training?
261
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,670
I am getting excited about it!
262
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,500
Next episode: "Gaara vs. Rock Lee:
The Power of Youth Explodes!"
263
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,670
I'm just a little envious of that training.

Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!
21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,270
W-What the heck is going on here?
22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,270
Hmm…
23
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,770
Help me!
24
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,350
Excuse me there, Mister!
Wait just a moment!
25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,600
What in the world is happening?
26
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,690
You should run away too!
27
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,400
There’s a monster up there!
28
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,480
A monster…?
29
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,600
What could it be?
This monster thing?!
30
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,440
It’s a g-gigantic snake!
lt destroyed the castle in a flash!
31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,310
How big of a snake?!
32
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,020
Me too, at my village before…
33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,770
I was attacked by a huge snake!
34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,980
We must hurry, Naruto!
35
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,980
That snake is probably the same one
that you saw before.
36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,890
Destroy the Leaf Village…?!
37
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,020
And your answer is?
38
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,980
Lady Tsunade!
39
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,980
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk…
40
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,890
Your brother and my uncle
wouldn’t want any of that!
41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,940
Their wishes…
42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,350
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,890
And dreams…
Did you forget them ?!
44
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,520
I know it!
45
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,900
Even if you are like this now,
you still…
46
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,100
Open your eyes! Wake up, please!
47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,520
Shut up, Shizune!
48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,730
You don’t have to answer right now.
49
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,190
However, I want it in a week.
50
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,890
Also, two human sacrifices are needed
for this Forbidden Jutsu,
51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,270
so do what you need to do
to prepare them.
52
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,730
Lady Tsunade, let’s kill them right here!
lt’s our chance!
53
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,890
With you and me, now we can…!
54
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,400
Lady Tsunade…
55
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,730
Sure, I am weak now.
56
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,890
However…
57
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,190
I also know Tsunade’s weakness.
58
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,690
That’s right, he is one of the Sannin
like Tsunade.
59
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,650
So he knows that…
60
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,440
I see it’s not cured yet…
61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,400
your fear of blood.
62
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,350
Hemophobia…?
63
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,100
Shall we get going, Kabuto?
64
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,310
Tsunade… I’ll be expecting
a favorable answer from you.
65
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,890
Looks like we were a little too late…
66
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,890
Is this that snake’s doing, too?!
67
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,850
– Let’s go, Naruto! 					– Huh?
68
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,560
Tsunade isn’t here any more.
69
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,980
Geez, you keep telling me that…!
70
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,890
Welcome!
71
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,400
Hey, you ol’ man, give me another shot!
72
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,890
Lady Tsunade, you’re drinking too much!
73
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,940
Lady Tsunade…
74
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,190
Heck, she’s nowhere to be found!
75
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,520
Dragging me around here and there,
76
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,350
but after all,
we haven’t found a single trace!
77
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,850
Hmm?
78
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,230
Well, let’s dine here for now.
79
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,980
Huh?
80
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,270
Isn’t this a pub?
81
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,690
So what?
82
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,940
I've told you so many times!
I’m still underage!
83
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:54,190
You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink.
Kids should only be eating snacks.
84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,060
– Well then… 					– Welcome!
85
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,400
There’s no need to dine here!
86
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,150
We can go to a ramen noodle shop
or something!
87
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,850
How stupid! You can gather information
in this type of place…
88
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,520
Huh…?
89
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,980
Huh?!
90
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,900
Tsunade!
91
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,890
Jiraiya?!
92
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,690
Why…are you here?
93
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,850
I’ve finally found you!
I’m exhausted…
94
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,900
That gal is Tsunade?!
95
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,600
She’s 50 years old for real?
96
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,890
Now, that’s a swindle.
97
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,060
I can’t believe…
I met two of the Sannin in one day.
98
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,400
Here you are!
99
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,310
In any case…
Today is a day I see many old friends.
100
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,940
You mean Orochimaru…
101
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,730
What happened?
102
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,060
Nothing, really.
We exchanged a greeting.
103
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,850
Is it really true that this gal
is the Kunoichi
104
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,810
who can heal any kind of wound?
105
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,480
What about you?
106
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,890
What do you want from me?
107
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,270
I’ll be straight with you.
108
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,940
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.
109
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,850
Hey, ol’ man,
gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!
110
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,980
All right, in a moment.
111
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,400
The Fifth Hokage?!
What’s this out of the blue?!
112
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,480
What the heck is going on?!
113
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,810
Do you know about the Third Hokage?
114
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,520
The Third Hokage?
So, he really was…
115
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,890
Orochimaru did it, right?
116
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,900
I heard about it.
directly from him.
117
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,850
Orochimaru did it…?
118
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,980
Orochimaru?!
119
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,400
Did he really killed the old man,
the Third Hokage?!
120
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,440
Who is this Orochimaru?!
121
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,230
Just like us, he’s one of the Sannin.
122
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,350
Why?! The Sannin are all
from Leaf Village, right?
123
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,650
Then why--?!
124
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,690
Who’s this brat?
125
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,150
He’s Naruto Uzumaki.
126
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,890
This brat is…
that Nine-Tailed Fox…?
127
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,890
Hey, you just hold it there!
128
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,690
I am not done talking yet!
129
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,150
This Orochimaru?!
This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.
130
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,190
Who the heck is he?!
131
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,310
He’s a legendary Sannin, right?!
132
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,440
Then knowing that…
133
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,650
why would you, Pervy Sage,
leave such a guy alone?!
134
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,100
Besides…
135
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,810
What do you mean this person
is the Fifth Hokage?!
136
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,020
Naruto, be quiet for a moment.
137
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,350
But…!
138
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,770
Just shut up!
139
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,650
I’ll say this again.
140
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,890
They are demanding that
you become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.
141
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,190
So what’s your answer?
142
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,890
Will you accept it?
143
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,560
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…
144
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,690
This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!
145
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,270
What do you say…Tsunade?
146
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,890
Lady Tsunade…
147
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,980
I really don’t get it!
148
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,890
Impossible…
149
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,890
I refuse!
150
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,810
I remember…those words.
151
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,400
You said those same words
when I asked you to go out with me.
152
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,560
What the heck are you talking about?!
You said it yourself!
153
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,560
Didn’t you say that
you will bring her back to the village
154
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,060
and have her treat Sasuke
and Kakashi Sensei ?!
155
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,770
But what’s this demand
for her to be the Hokage?!
156
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,600
And, on top of that, she refuses!
157
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,900
Lady Tsunade…
158
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,890
Could she be thinking of making
a deal with Orochimaru?
159
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,600
Calm down.
160
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,270
There can’t be no other Fifth Hokage,
but this Tsunade.
161
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,730
During the dreadful Great War Era,
162
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,100
she contributed tremendously
to the Leaf’s victory.
163
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,890
To this date,
164
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,810
there’s no one who can rival
her combat and medical skills.
165
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,890
Still more, this Tsunade is
the granddaughter of the First Hokage.
166
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,730
So together with her talents,
167
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,850
there’s no one else more suited
to becoming the Fifth Hokage.
168
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,770
If she becomes Hokage,
169
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,600
that means that
she’ll come back to the village.
170
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,190
And then, as I’d told you,
she can treat the two.
171
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,890
Besides, this is what the Leaf’s
top decision-making advisors settled upon.
172
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,560
Genin like you have no say
on this matter.
173
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Jiraiya…
174
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,560
Unlike your previous apprentice,
175
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,890
this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,
he’s ugly to match.
176
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,940
What?!
177
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,270
It’s tough on anyone to be
compared to the Fourth Hokage.
178
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,150
He had all the qualities to be
the greatest Ninja in all history.
179
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,520
Brimming with talent in Jutsu,
and he had a brilliant mind!
180
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,600
Popular with people and well…
he was as handsome as me.
181
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,150
But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.
182
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,900
Risking his own life for the village…
183
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,440
Life is different from money…
184
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,980
To easily risk it and lose it,
is a fool’s doing!
185
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,890
Did she say “fool”?!
186
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,600
Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage
187
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,890
seemed to want to subdue
the disturbances of war above all else.
188
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,810
But after all, they died in vain,
189
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,520
in the midst of their dreams
for the village.
190
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,100
You have changed, Tsunade…
191
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,810
I don’t know what
you thought in your heart before,
192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,560
but to say such thing out loud…
193
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,020
Although I look young,
I’m already in my 50s…
194
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,600
Years change people.
195
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,890
Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei…
196
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,890
No wonder he died showing off
at that old age!
197
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,730
Hokage is a bother.
198
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,850
No one but a fool would take it on.
199
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,850
Why you--?!
200
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,150
– Let go of me!
– Don't! We're in a pub.
201
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,270
I said, let go of me!
202
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,890
Lady Tsunade…!
203
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,940
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage…
204
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,890
It doesn’t matter if
you are a woman!
205
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,480
I’ll clobber you with all my might!
206
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,850
You’re pretty gutsy…
confronting me like this.
207
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,350
Let’s take this outside, brat!
208
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,600
Lady Tsunade!
209
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,980
Though I may not look it,
I am one of the Sannin.
210
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,560
Why should I even take a Genin seriously.
211
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,400
What did you say?!
212
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,650
An advance notice for a KO?
213
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,980
I don’t mean one minute…
214
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,440
With one finger.
This is enough to take you down.
215
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,890
Lady Tsunade!
216
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,310
Well…
217
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,770
Come on, kiddo.
218
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,310
D-Don’t make fun of me!
219
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,730
Darn it!
220
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,940
Lady Tsunade!
221
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,850
Forehead poking?!
222
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,650
Why that no good--!
223
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,060
She’s strong…
224
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,020
Hey, brat!
225
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,980
I’ll ask you one thing before you faint.
226
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,890
Why…get so passionate at
the mention of Hokage’s name?
227
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,890
Unlike you…
228
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,520
I will be the heir to the Hokage name,
no matter what!
229
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,100
Because Hokage is…
230
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,890
Because Hokage is my dream!
231
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,100
That kid…
232
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,980
What? She’s a bit off her guard…
233
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,440
I can’t tackle her head on.
234
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,480
Then, I should use that Jutsu now…
235
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,150
Concentrate!
236
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,230
Oh, no!
237
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,810
Wha--?! This Jutsu is…!
238
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,890
Take this!
239
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,150
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
240
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,650
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
241
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,810
On your still shoulder
242
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,440
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
243
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,940
The city lights are like pieces of stars
244
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,890
That hold us together
245
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:57,560
“Each one of us glows differently,”
246
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,150
you say laughingly
247
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,100
but you look most dazzling
248
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,020
Like a comet,
249
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,230
like the rainbow after the storm
250
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:24,440
You bring light into my heart
251
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:34,890
Being lost can be the answer
252
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:43,730
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
253
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,810
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
254
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,600
It's been a long time since we drank
alone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?
255
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,810
I didn't necessarily want to see you.
256
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,890
Don't say that.
257
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,310
By the way,
you're prettier than before.
258
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,770
You haven't changed a bit.
259
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,890
Understand this.
I'm not interested in you.
260
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,770
Neither am I.
After all, you're actually 50 years old--
261
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,020
– Did you say something?
– No, nothing.
262
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,810
I was just remembering
the old days.
263
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,020
Next time: "Inheritance!
"The Necklace of Death!"

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,200
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,040
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,330
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,700
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:58,000
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

Sasuke…?
21
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,410
No… Who is he?
22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
He's got the same Sharingan
as Sasuke.
23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,950
Really…
24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,620
who’d believe a kid like you to
have the Nine-Tailed Fox in him.
25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Why does that guy know
about the Nine-Tailed Fox?!
26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,580
Naruto, you will come with us.
27
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,160
Roar, Chidori!
Brother vs. Brother!
28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,660
That guy is…close by!

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,700
That guy!
30
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,660
Elder Brother…
31
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,660
Today…
32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,740
when school’s over,
help me train for a Shuriken Jutsu…
33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,120
I’m busy… Have father teach you.
34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,740
But you’re better at Shuriken Jutsu,
Elder Brother…
35
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,740
Even I can see that.
36
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,580
You always treat me
like a pest, Elder Brother.
37
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,950
Ouch!
38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,740
Forgive me Sasuke…
Some other time, okay?
39
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,160
I don’t have time to
pay attention to you today.
40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,330
You’re always jabbing my forehead
and saying "Forgive me, Sasuke."
41
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,740
You also say "not today,"
but there's never a day.
42
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,370
Father.
43
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,080
Huh?
44
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,950
Why doesn’t Elder Brother
pay any attention to me?
45
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,450
That guy’s a little strange…
46
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,250
He’s the type that doesn’t really like
to become intimate with people.
47
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,870
Why?
48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don’t know.
49
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,330
I am his father and
still I can’t read that boy…
50
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,450
Here!
51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
Your boxed lunch, Sasuke!
52
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,870
If you’re worried about doing
Shuriken Jutsu practice,
53
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,410
I will watch you when you get home.
54
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,740
They’re not practices,
they’re training!
55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,910
See you later!
56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,620
Sasuke, are you on
your way to school?
57
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,830
Yes.
58
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,740
I saw Itachi earlier on.
He’s really become a man.
59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,160
He’s already a top-notch Shinobi.
60
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,740
He graduated at the head of his class
at the Academy at the age of seven,
61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,040
and attained Chunin level
at the age of ten, didn’t he?
62
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,250
He became adept at using
Sharingan at the age of eight.
63
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,370
Yes, I remember.
64
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,740
That boy is truly
the pride of the Uchiha clan.
65
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,200
By the way,
how old are you now, Sasuke?
66
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,750
I’m the same age as
when Elder Brother graduated,
67
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,830
but I can’t…
68
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,040
What’s the matter?
69
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,910
Hey!
70
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,870
Stop talking nonsense!
71
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh my, dear.
72
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,160
Sasuke, both you and Itachi
come from the same Uchiha clan,
73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,500
the pedigree of
the Hidden Leaf Village.
74
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,120
Have confidence!
75
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,450
You’ll be an amazing
Shinobi just like Itachi one day.
76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,540
Yeah!
77
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,410
See you later!
78
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,330
Do your best!
79
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,580
Study hard!
80
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,910
That’s right…
81
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,040
I come from the same Uchiha clan
as Elder Brother…
82
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,740
I won’t lose to Elder Brother!
83
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,330
I’m pretty late…
84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,290
What was that?
85
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,450
I had the feeling
there was someone there…
86
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,740
The lights are out.
Even though it’s not time for bed…
87
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,250
What’s this?!
88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,620
W-What’s this?!
89
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,450
What in the world is this?!
90
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,740
Uncle… Auntie…
91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,950
Father… Mother…!
92
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,000
Father? Mother?
93
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,500
Aren’t you here?
94
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,500
There’s somebody here!
95
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,450
Move!
96
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,660
Move!
97
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,870
Move!
98
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,750
Father! Mother!
99
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,740
Elder Brother!
100
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,540
Elder Brother!
Father and Mother are…!
101
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,870
Why? For what reason?!
102
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,740
Who in the world would do
something like this…?
103
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,910
Elder Brother… What are you…?
104
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,660
What are you doing,
Elder Brother!
105
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,620
Foolish little brother…
106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,740
Mangekyo Sharingan!
107
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,580
My legs…!
108
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,740
Stop!
109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,620
Elder Brother!
110
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,080
Don’t make me see this!
111
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,540
Why…?
112
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,870
Why did you, Elder Brother…?!
113
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,790
No…!
114
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,120
No…
115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,160
Auntie! Uncle!
116
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,950
Father! Mother!
117
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,200
Stop it! Elder Brother!
118
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,410
Don’t kill Father and Mother!
119
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,740
W-Why…
120
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,250
Why did you…? Elder Brother…?
121
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,450
To measure my abilities…
122
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,740
Measure your abilities…?
Just for that?
123
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,500
Are you saying that…
124
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,950
Just for that…
you killed them all?
125
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,870
That is of great importance.
126
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,790
What do you mean…?
127
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,910
Don’t talk rubbish!
128
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,120
I’m scared…
129
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,250
I’m scared!
130
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,580
Don’t kill me…!
131
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,660
D-Don’t kill me!
132
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,750
You are not even worth killing…
133
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,740
Foolish little brother…
134
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,740
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!
Hate me!
135
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,500
And keep on surviving in
that unsightly manner…
136
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,580
Just continue fleeing and fleeing
and hang onto your life!
137
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,500
Shall we go outside…?
138
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,870
These guys aren’t just anybody…
139
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,740
Itachi, it’ll be a pain in the neck
if this kid moves around and…
140
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,620
Maybe I better chop off
a leg just in case…
141
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,700
W-What did he say?!
142
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,740
Now then…
143
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,750
Long time no see…
144
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,410
Sasuke.
145
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,740
Itachi Uchiha!
146
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,330
Itachi…Uchiha?
147
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,250
The same as Sasuke…
An Uchiha…
148
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,700
Huh…Sharingan…
149
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,410
And moreover,
he resembles you a lot…
150
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Who the heck is he?
151
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,660
He’s my younger brother.
152
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,740
But I heard that the entire Uchiha clan
had been murdered.
153
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,000
By you.
154
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,330
Itachi Uchiha…I will kill you!
155
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,080
I must kill one certain man
without fail!
156
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,120
That man…
157
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,040
My elder brother…
158
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:36,200
I thought I couldn’t die…
without killing him, but…
159
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,290
That’s the guy that Sasuke
was saying …
160
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,160
The man he wanted to kill…
161
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,120
It’s just as you said…
162
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,700
I held a grudge against you
and hated you.
163
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,370
For the singular purpose of
killing you, I…
164
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,120
I…
165
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,200
have lived my life!
166
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,080
Sasuke…!
167
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,870
Chidori…?
168
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,740
I will kill you!
169
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,740
Die!
170
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,290
W-What’s going on?!
171
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,740
I can’t believe that Sasuke’s Jutsu
was so easily thwarted…
172
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,330
This doesn’t look good!
173
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,870
I’ve got to do something!
174
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Chakra permeates the air…
175
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,370
I see…
176
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,910
So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!
177
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,830
You jerk!
178
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,830
You’re in the way!
179
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,750
Sasuke!
180
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,740
Darn it!
181
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,330
Ninja Art: Summo…
182
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,450
You’re too slow!
183
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,330
Huh…? I can’t feel the Chakra…
184
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,040
Darn! Darn! Why is it?!
185
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,160
My sword Shark Skin
has the ability to…
186
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,830
cut through and eat Chakra!
187
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,200
It’s a pain in the butt
188
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,540
if the kid moves around
and uses Jutsu like that…
189
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,750
Before these legs…
190
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,740
Should I chop off these arms?
191
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,330
Why doesn’t it emerge?!
192
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,120
It’s pointless…
193
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,330
What?
194
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,290
You guys just don’t know me much,
do you?
195
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,410
This man Jiraiya does not fall victim
to any woman’s allurement,
196
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,330
but rather his forte is
winning women’s affection!
197
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,540
I’m not made to blindly follow after
a woman’s feminine charm!
198
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,790
When you get to my level,
199
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,580
women yelp with delight
at my sex appeal!
200
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,450
A cycle of hardship, right?
201
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,410
Inside, we were crying, right?
202
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:39,740
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
203
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,740
It's a secondary role,
204
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,580
a role in the shadows
205
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,790
But in reaching for that dream,
206
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:59,540
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
207
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
208
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
209
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:18,830
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
210
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,250
Over and over,
we've seen fools\
211
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,750
Watch out, Sasuke!
212
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,790
Naruto, don’t help him.
213
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,790
But…Sasuke is!
214
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:01,740
It is your duty to watch
through this battle, Naruto.
215
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,790
What?!
216
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,740
This is his fight…
217
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,700
This represents everything that
he has been carrying up to now.
218
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,950
Next time: “Hate Among the Uchihas:
The Last of the Clan!”
//%

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,300
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,800
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,420
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,000
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,420
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,420
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,090
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,920
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,210
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,590
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,880
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,460
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,050
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,550
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,170
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,790
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,460
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,050
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,250
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,790
A Dubious Offer!
Tsunade's Choice
21
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,090
Not good…
22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,460
Dang it! Dang it!
This time for sure…no matter what!
23
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,550
You’re the only one who can treat
Lord Orochimaru’s arms.
24
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,790
Why don’t we make a deal?
25
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,170
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…
26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,050
with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,550
Don’t you want to see those two,
Tsunade…?
28
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,960
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk…
29
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,500
Their wishes…
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
30
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,340
And dreams…
Did you forget them?!
31
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,790
I’ll be straight with you.
32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.
33
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,800
The successive line of Hokages
34
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,790
have protected the Leaf Village
and those living in it.
35
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,460
They brought troubled times under control
36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,960
and helped the village to prosper.
37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300
They risked their lives for
this dream, this ideal!
38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,840
You don’t have to answer right now.
39
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,790
However, I want it in a week.
40
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,500
Also, two human sacrifices are
needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,
41
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,790
so do what you need to do
to prepare them.
42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,210
We are starting!
43
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,710
C’mon. Place your bets!
44
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,000
Which will you bet on, ma’am?
45
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,800
Which one? C’mon!
46
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,130
Which one will she choose?
47
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,790
If she agrees to our conditions,
48
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,380
your arms will be healed,
49
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,840
and the destruction of the Leaf Village
will continue immediately.
50
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,250
Lady Tsunade will also be able to
be reunited with the two whom she loves.
51
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,790
But if she doesn’t agree…
52
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,090
I’ll have to force her to heal my arms…
53
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,210
Will it really be that easy?
54
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,090
I have you.
55
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,790
There’s no need to worry.
56
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,210
I’m the one who knows her the best.
57
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,790
And her greatest weakness!
58
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,300
She’ll definitely accept the conditions…
Definitely!
59
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,130
Listen, in this third step,
60
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,050
you’ve got to use 100%
of what you have learned…
61
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,550
And retain them.
62
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,630
In other words,
63
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,460
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon
64
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,420
and compressing the Chakra inside it.
65
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,590
I know that in my head…
66
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,790
But no matter what,
67
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,170
I can’t completely hold 100%
of my power in a neat ball…
68
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,590
Don’t give him false hope by teaching him
something he can't master.
69
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,380
That’s why the moony kid
starts joking about becoming a Hokage!
70
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Tomorrow, huh.
71
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,790
Come again, okay?
72
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,130
I certainly will!
73
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,790
Are you going to meet
Orochimaru again?
74
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,340
To think she’d be that shaken up…
75
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,340
Something extreme must have happened.
76
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,630
That one week bugs me, somehow…
77
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,790
And Naruto hasn’t come back
to the inn for nearly a week.
78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,500
I guess I’ll press Tsunade a little more.
79
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,750
No good…
80
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,800
No good… Why?
81
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,050
Here there’s no time…
lt’ll be too late.
82
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,670
What’s this…?!
83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,790
What happened, Naruto?!
84
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Are you okay?
85
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,710
What do you want?
86
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,090
The moon’s out.
87
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,840
How about going out for a drink?
88
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,790
Tomorrow will be the one week
you promised to Naruto.
89
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,250
I wonder what became of Naruto?
90
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,790
Beats me.
91
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,500
I guess I’ll have something.
92
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,790
Radish, please.
93
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,790
Coming up.
94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,300
Oh?
95
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Here you go.
96
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,380
Ooh! This looks good.
97
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,880
Lady Tsunade!
98
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,790
What happened to Naruto?
99
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,790
He’s quite exhausted and weakened.
100
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,790
And his right hand is severely burned
with Chakra…
101
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,590
As it stands now,
102
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,840
this kid probably won’t wake up
until the day after tomorrow.
103
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,800
It’s as Jiraiya says…
104
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,050
Why did I make such a stupid bet?
105
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,130
What am I, of all people,
getting so worked up for?
106
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,500
How stupid.
107
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,880
Tomorrow…
108
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,630
Please don’t go tomorrow!
109
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,920
Why don’t you say anything?!
110
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,590
Lady Tsunade! Please don’t be silent.
Please answer!
111
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,960
If you say that you’re going…
112
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,090
What will you do?
113
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,630
I’ll stop you with my life!
114
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,960
Shizune… Have you forgotten
who you’re talking to?
115
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,790
Sir! It’s morning, now!
lt’s about time you went home!
116
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,630
Geez.
117
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,630
Hey! Get up, sir…
118
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,880
Hey! What’s wrong, you?!
119
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,300
It’ll be troublesome if we’re disturbed
during the negotiations…
120
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,380
What do you want me to do?
121
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,420
It might be good to kill…
Tsunade’s attendant.
122
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,300
It seems that you…
123
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,210
You don’t trust me completely…yet.
124
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,170
Precisely because I trust you…
125
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,210
I would like to leave Sasuke
in your hands.
126
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,090
Well, then…
127
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,790
Kabuto…
128
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,710
If you wish to stop me…
129
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,550
You have no choice
but to kill young Sasuke, now.
130
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,920
You can’t possibly kill me…
131
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,340
Hey!
132
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,790
I said hey!
133
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,250
Naruto…?
134
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,790
Oh no! What time is it?
No, what day is it?
135
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,960
It’s Monday…
136
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,420
What is it?
137
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,710
Is your body okay?
138
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,550
As I recall, you were supposed
to sleep for two full days…
139
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,130
No matter what the wound,
140
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,880
I’m always able to recover
if I sleep one night!
141
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,630
That’s right.
This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
142
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,710
More importantly,
where’s that stupid old woman?!
143
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,960
Today’s the promised bet day.
144
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,790
Then, what about the Jutsu…
145
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,250
It’s still not complete, but I can wing it…
Believe it!
146
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
That’s right. This isn’t the time for this.
147
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,840
– Naruto, please stay…
– Huh?
148
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,590
You are…!
149
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,840
What?! Oh!
150
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,880
Wait, Shizune!
151
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,590
That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.
152
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,960
I can’t build up my Chakra well…
153
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,340
And my body is so numb,
I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.
154
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,550
What was he gonna do
if that had hit me?!
155
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,380
That’s lame! Here you’re always bragging
about how you’re this awesome Ninja!
156
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,210
And you’re nailed by her perverted attack?
You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!
157
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,670
Shut up!
158
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,170
Even if she’s rotten,
she’s still a medical specialist.
159
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,790
She’s the only one who could concoct
a tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.
160
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,840
But to think I’d be caught off-guard,
161
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,750
no matter how intoxicated I was…
162
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,050
I’m going to kill you, bastard!
163
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,790
How are you feeling,
Master Jiraiya?
164
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,960
Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.
165
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,790
But be that as it may,
maybe around thirty percent…
166
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,420
I never thought I’d end up encountering
that Master Jiraiya in a place like this…
167
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,790
Things have gotten difficult.
I guess I’ll pull back for now.
168
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,090
At any rate, Naruto…
To think you’d be here, too…
169
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,790
Hey! Shizune.
170
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,210
Y-Yes?!
171
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,500
It’s about time you tell me
172
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,800
what the heck she was talking about
with Orochimaru.
173
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,790
Orochimaru?!
174
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,250
I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade…
175
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,630
That’s why I couldn’t say until now.
176
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,210
But…
177
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,790
There’s no time.
Please come with me!
178
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,790
I’ll explain as we run!
179
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,790
Okay!
180
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,170
I’m going, too!
181
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,960
What’s your answer?
182
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,380
Say what?!
183
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,300
The answer to that is definitely no!
184
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,460
This might be really bad…
185
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,250
She’s probably still thinking
of those two.
186
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,790
Perhaps I may have no choice,
but to kill Tsunade…
187
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,340
Dang it!
188
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,960
I’ll heal your arms…
189
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,380
In exchange for that,
keep your hands off the village.
190
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,630
Very well.
191
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,590
Now then…
192
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,790
He’s planning to once again attack
193
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,790
the Leaf Village if
his arms are healed!
194
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,300
The situation will get
even more dangerous than that
195
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,380
if he’s not stopped now.
196
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,790
Him screwing around like that!
197
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,790
I have you.
There’s no need to worry…
198
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,800
What’s the meaning of this?
199
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,920
To think you’d betray me at this point…
200
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,460
Tsunade!
201
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,790
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
202
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,130
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
203
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,300
On your still shoulder
204
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,920
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
205
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,670
The city lights are like pieces of stars
206
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,420
That hold us together
207
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:58,050
“Each one of us glows differently,”
208
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,790
you say laughingly
209
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,790
but you look most dazzling
210
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,750
Like a comet,
211
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,790
like the rainbow after the storm
212
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,920
You bring light into my heart
213
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:35,380
Being lost can be the answer
214
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:44,210
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
215
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,300
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
216
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,420
What the hell is this?! This castle
has been destroyed even further!
217
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,050
It seems Tsunade has
declined the deal.
218
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,630
But…but the old lady is not here!
219
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,420
Calm down a second.
She shouldn't have gone far from here.
220
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,170
Oh, some incredible noise
from that direction, Pervy Sage!
221
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,670
Well, well…she started a flashy battle.
222
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,000
Naruto, we go after her!
223
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,790
Right! I'm ready anytime!
224
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,130
Next time:
"Breakdown! The Deal is Off!"
//%
1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,590
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,090
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,710
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,300
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,710
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,710
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,380
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,210
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,500
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,790
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,170
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,750
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,340
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,460
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,050
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,750
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,340
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,550
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,130
Well then, Guy.
I’ll leave Sasuke to you.
21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,500
Master Jiraiya…
22
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,420
Hmm?
23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,210
Be sure to find Mistress Tsunade
and bring her back to…
24
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,960
You bet we'll find her
and bring her right away!
25
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,790
Naruto! I like kids with guts like you!
I'm going to give this to you!
26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
This made Lee stronger…
27
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,880
Huh?! What ?! What?!
28
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,670
This is it!
29
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,920
Wow!
30
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,090
They're breathable and
moisture-wicking,
31
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,590
and perfectly designed for free movement,
all in a beautiful, stylish package.
32
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,920
You'll notice a difference immediately
if you train with them on!
33
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,090
They're going to grow on you!
34
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,670
Before long, you'll be wanting to
wear them all the time like Lee!
35
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,000
Of course, I have a thing for them, too!
36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,880
Woooow!
37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,250
Why couldn’t you bring a mirror
or something
38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,380
instead of carrying around
those things, you dork!
39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,880
Do you think they'll look good on me?
40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,090
Don't even think about it.
Get a load of that…
41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,550
Now that is truly dorky.
42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay! This is the place!
43
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,210
Here?!
44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,800
The gambling house frequented
by the entire town…
45
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,750
Your target is Naruto, after all.
46
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:23,050
To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
47
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,630
What's wrong?
48
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,340
Pervy Sage… Why are they after me?
49
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,000
You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?
Tell me why…
50
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,790
They're not really after you…
They're after what's inside of you.
51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,380
What on earth is this thing?
52
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,210
It's a horrible demon that
attacked Leaf Village, right?
53
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,710
And was dreaded by all.
54
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,880
So why do they want it so much?
55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,880
Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox
is a demon
56
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,380
that appears at each critical juncture
throughout the ages
57
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,880
destroying everything in its path…
58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,340
And people feared it like
an act of nature.
59
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,300
The reason they want that thing…
for what purpose.
60
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,460
Honestly, I can't quite say.
61
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox
is sealed up inside of you…
62
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,630
they might be thinking
they want that power in their control.
63
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,130
It must be harsh to know
64
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,630
that Ninja like them
would keep coming after you…
65
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,790
But well, that's your destiny!
66
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,210
Now don’t you worry,
I'm going to protect--
67
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,790
Then there's nothing to do
but hurry up and get stronger! I've got to!
68
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,090
Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,
69
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,590
have her save Sasuke
and get down to some serious training!
70
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,790
That's just like this kid…
71
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:27,380
A New Training Begins:
I Will Be Strong!
72
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,090
Th-This place has the highest antes…!
73
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,500
Don't go fretting over
every little thing!
74
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,630
Let's go!
75
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,960
Oh dear! Please wait!
76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,790
Hmm?
77
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,090
What?
78
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,590
The beautiful woman you
want to "research" on…
79
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,790
That's this Tsunade person?
80
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,790
Whoa! That’s sharp coming from you!
And what about it?
81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,340
She's part of the Sannin thing
like you, right, Pervy Sage?
82
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,590
Yes, and what of it?
83
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,500
How…old is she?
84
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,790
My age.
85
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,130
Heck, she's an old lady.
86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,920
Yikes!
87
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,550
Huh?!
88
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,170
Th-This woman is…!
89
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,750
Would you mind changing all
of this money into chips for me?
90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh no! She's really going for it!
91
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,300
Just who is this? This lady…
92
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,300
You don't know?
93
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,380
She's that woman with
the famous alias…
94
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,550
Famous alias…?
95
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,500
So, well…what kind of person
is this Tsunade like?
96
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,790
Oh, you want to know?
97
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,630
Yeah.
98
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,130
Let's see…
99
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,420
Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.
100
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,750
Besides that, she's a diehard gambler
and her face is known far and wide for it.
101
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,790
Then we should have no problems
finding her!
102
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,630
If she's that famous!
103
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,750
She's famous, all right…
Legendary, you might say…
104
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,420
Boss, what's this alias…?
105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,090
The Legendary…
106
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,920
Legendary…?
107
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,790
Oh dear! They're all laughing!
108
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,550
– Legendary… 					– Legendary…
109
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,790
Sitting Duck!
110
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,630
Yup! But no matter how famous
Legendary Sitting Duck is,
111
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,090
I doubt we'll find her right away.
112
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,800
Why not?!
113
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,210
She hates growing old so much
114
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,630
she's probably used some special Jutsu
to change her appearance.
115
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,790
She's actually 50 years old,
116
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,210
but no doubt she looks like
she did when she was 20…
117
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,960
And not just that,
recently I heard that…
118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,880
she transforms into her teens or
30s or 40s as the situation calls for
119
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,550
to escape moneylenders.
120
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,380
What?! That's a horrible thing to do!
121
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,790
Tsunade has always loved
to gamble more than anything
122
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,210
But she has terrible luck and no skill.
123
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
She was always being played
for the Sitting Duck and the name stuck…
124
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,380
Then she was always borrowing money
and skipping out on her debts, too…
125
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,170
Ah, it brings back memories.
126
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,590
This is no time to be
getting all nostalgic!
127
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,790
Tell me, how do you propose
we go about finding her?!
128
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,460
Well…
129
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,300
We may very well have to
put our noses to the ground,
130
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,340
but we're not without our little tricks.
131
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,670
What?! So you have no idea
how long it's gong to take?!
132
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,790
We won't be wasting any time.
133
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,630
All of our time on the road
will be your time.
134
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,790
My time?
135
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,790
Time to make you strong…
Training!
136
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,130
Okay!
137
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,750
No, no… I told you that is definitely out.
138
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,750
I won't be seen walking with someone
dressed like that.
139
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,710
Come on, Pervy Sage!
Let's hurry up and start training!
140
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,000
Now now, don't get ahead of yourself…
141
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,790
The training won't mean anything
142
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,840
unless it's done in the process of
gathering information on Tsunade.
143
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Huh? Gathering information…?
144
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,050
In this town.
145
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,550
Wow!
146
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,790
Cool! This is my first time
for this kind of thing!
147
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,790
Down time is important, too!
148
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,790
You go have yourself some fun
before we start training.
149
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,420
The festival should continue
for some time.
150
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,790
We'll stay here in this city
for the duration.
151
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,840
We'll train here, too!
152
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,710
All right!
153
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,840
Whoa! That's a fat wallet!
You're rich!
154
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,170
I have quite a bit!
155
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,550
I've saved it little by little
throughout my missions.
156
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,170
Well then!
157
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,880
– Wait! Naruto! 					– Huh?
158
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,460
I'll hold on to your wallet for you!
159
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,710
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
160
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,500
You can spend this much…
161
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,590
What?! Only 300 ryo!
162
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,050
No complaints!
163
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,420
Remember Shinobi must honor
the " Shinobi’s Three Taboos"!
164
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,790
Shinobi’s Three Taboos…?
What's that?
165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,840
What?! You don't know!
166
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,790
The "three taboos" are
the three temptations
167
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,590
that will bring Shinobi to ruin!
168
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,550
The three temptations are
booze, women and money…
169
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,300
Oh, then this doesn't really apply
to me all that much!
170
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,170
I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!
I don't quite get the women thing!
171
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,170
And I worked so hard
to save all that money,
172
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,840
I don't really feel much like using it…
173
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,460
You fool! Don't you underestimate
the desire for money!
174
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,380
Once you start using it,
it goes really fast!
175
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,340
Money has a frightful power.
176
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,710
This Tsunade we are going
to be looking for
177
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,130
has ruined herself over it!
178
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,790
Your desire for women is always
getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!
179
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,750
I'm going on
an information-gathering mission!
180
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,790
Here, you hold on to my bag for me!
181
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
If you get lost,
182
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,880
my tracking SummonsToad
will follow my scent!
183
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,340
He's really just a child after all,
contrary to appearances…
184
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat!
185
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,130
I’ll take one order of
octopus dumplings, sir!
186
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,790
Right!
187
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,460
– Potatoes with butter please!
– You got it!
188
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,050
– I want chocolate bananas.
– Right!
189
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,750
– I want apricot candy!
– Thank you!
190
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,130
– I want okonomiyaki too!
– Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!
191
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,170
One extra-large order
of fried noodle, sir!
192
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,550
Right…But my you've got
a lot of food there, young man!
193
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,130
You don't plan
to eat it all yourself now, do you?!
194
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,750
Eh? As a matter of fact,
I am gong to eat it all myself.
195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,500
Oh, um, here you go…
196
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,250
I think I ate a bit too much.
197
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,670
I wonder how everyone is?
198
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,790
Kakashi Sensei… Sasuke… Sakura…
199
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,670
I'm going to train hard every day
and come back stronger.
200
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,800
Just you wait and see!
201
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,790
But before that…
I better work off that meal!
202
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,420
Last one!
203
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,670
– All right! Perfect!
– Oh! Amazing!
204
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,500
That's the fruit of hard training
throwing shuriken.
205
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,250
You stink, sonny!
206
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,000
Hah! Gosh darn it!
Well, just watch this!
207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,880
Hold it!
208
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,790
Huh?
209
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,090
Attention: Shinobi!
Ninjutsu strictly forbidden!
210
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,790
Thanks now!
211
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,550
You shouldn't try to walk around
with the mask on.
212
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,790
It's Pervy Sage’s bank saving book.
213
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,800
One, ten, one hundred…
214
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,300
L-Look at all those zeros!
215
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,790
He should be treating me now and then
if he has this much money.
216
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,790
Stingy old geezer!
217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,090
There's only a little left… .
One more stand and that will be it…
218
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,500
Time to make you strong…
Training!
219
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,590
Two grilled squids please, sir!
Make one of those an adult size!
220
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,590
Okay! Someone sent you
to buy some squid, eh?!
221
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,960
I'll throw in a child size for free!
Coming right up!
222
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,000
Hurray for you, sir!
You're a man among men!
223
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right!
I'll give you the adult one for half price!
224
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,500
Thanks!
225
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,670
Good grief, where did he go to?!
226
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,880
Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?
227
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,790
Young ladies are so nice.
228
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,790
Oh, Naruto! You've already had
you're fill of the festival?
229
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,380
Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!
230
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,790
You're breaking all three at once!
You bastard!
231
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,790
W-Wait, Naruto…
232
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,210
N-No, I won't wait!
233
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,710
You used all my hard-saved money!
234
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,790
– Take this and this and this!
– N-Naruto, stop!
235
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,630
I'll pay it all back!
I'm sorry, p-please!
236
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,250
You! You!
You made my froggy wallet all flat!
237
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,130
Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!
238
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,920
You stained Leader's designer suit!
You'll have to pay for it!
239
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,790
Fork over 100,000 ryo!
240
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,500
What?! You're telling me
that suit cost 100,000 ryo?!
241
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,050
Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch
242
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,960
to say a dorky suit like that
cost 100,000 ryo.
243
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you asking for it?!
244
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,170
You better put a lid on it
if you know what's good for you.
245
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,380
The leader used be a Chunin from
the Hidden Village of Stones,
246
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,340
the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!
247
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,960
Come again? Legendary what?
248
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,960
You seem to want to get hurt!
249
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Naruto.
250
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,050
Perfect timing.
251
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll show you a Jutsu now…
Watch very carefully!
252
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,170
Now you've done it!
253
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,710
A-Amazing!
254
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,630
I was holding back quite a bit…
You guys are so weak.
255
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,790
A-Are you? The…legendary…
256
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,590
I'm sorry…
We kind of destroyed your stand…
257
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,340
H-Here… Fix it with this.
258
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,710
Oh! Thanks.
259
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,790
Would you mind if I bought all
your balloons and water balloons
260
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,210
at the same time, my man?
261
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,790
Fine by me…
262
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,250
That wasn’t an ordinary hand move…
263
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,340
What in blazes was that?!
That Jutsu!
264
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,790
Naruto!
265
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,960
Come with me! It’s training time!
266
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,960
Yes, sir!
267
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,670
Finally, the mood is right
for a little training.
268
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,790
– Here! Water balloon!
– Wha--?
269
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,550
Eh?! What is it for?!
270
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,130
You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?
271
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,710
Y-Yeah.
272
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,130
What Jutsu did it look like to you?
273
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,210
It looked like you made
your opponent spin violently.
274
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,790
His perspective's off…
But I guess that's to be expected.
275
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,790
Right, okay… Yes, spinning!
276
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,800
He's spinning the water in the balloon
without moving his hand?!
277
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,090
Whoa!
278
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,000
The tree-climbing exercise
279
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,790
to learn to gather and
maintain Chakra in necessary places…
280
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,130
The Walk-on-Water exercise
281
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,250
to learn how to release
a set amount of Chakra…
282
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,000
You did both of these, right?
283
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,790
And now with this water balloon exercise,
284
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,710
you'll learn how to create
a stream of Chakra…
285
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,790
In other words, spinning.
286
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,050
Create a stream of Chakra…
287
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,790
I'll give a more detailed explanation
of the Jutsu
288
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,420
once you get these first steps down.
289
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,340
First, you must gather
and maintain Chakra in your hand
290
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,790
using the tree-climbing technique.
291
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,920
Then you must continuously
release Chakra
292
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,840
using the Walk-on-Water technique.
293
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,790
Then you push and churn the water
in the balloon with the Chakra!
294
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,800
I get it!
295
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,750
Then you spin the water
in the balloon faster and faster
296
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,960
until the balloon pops!
297
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,750
You're catching on
more and more quickly!
298
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,590
Okay, today we're going
to train until evening!
299
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,590
Yes, sir!
300
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,750
A cycle of hardship, right?
301
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,710
Inside, we were crying, right?
302
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:39,800
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
303
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,880
It's a secondary role,
304
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,790
a role in the shadows
305
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,090
But in reaching for that dream,
306
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,790
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
307
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
308
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,840
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
309
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:19,130
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
310
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,550
Over and over,
we've seen fools
311
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,250
I will break this water balloon
no matter what!
312
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,790
Hey, you're full of spirit!
313
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,880
Perhaps I can expect him
to master the Jutsu.
314
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,750
The water inside the balloon
is moving.
315
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,790
By the way, when does that pop?
316
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,670
Next time: “Keep on Training:
Pop Goes the Water Balloon!”
317
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,250
Aw geez! Why won't it pop?!
//%
1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,220
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,160
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,030
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,200
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,520
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,530
Now
12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,450
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,790
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,550
Now, let the tenth round begin.
20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,520
Do your best!
21
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,720
Fatso!
22
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,230
Damn it!
23
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,790
Those two better watch out!
24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,530
I’ll end this match quickly and
turn you into mincemeat!
25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,070
Then let's not play around...
26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,200
I’ll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.
27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,540
You bandaged cucumber roll!
28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,210
I know his Achilles heel all too well
from my last battle with him.
29
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,520
Those holes in his arm emit
a pulsing sound, so…
30
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,520
Ninja Art!
31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,790
Expansion Jutsu!
32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,190
Followed by the
Hidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!
33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,530
All I have to do is to prevent him
from aiming at my ears!
34
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,530
Human Boulder Jutsu!
35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,700
Hooray for Big-Boned!
36
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,770
Good!
37
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,470
Squash him, Choji!
38
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,080
This guy can attack sonically without
even touching the opponent…
39
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,450
But that’s only when ears are showing!
40
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,520
With Choji’s whole head buried,
it’s like he’s wearing ear plugs.
41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
how does anyone make a sonic attack
on a meat ball,
42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,930
let alone one that’s rolling?
43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
The way you are…
you can barely move, can you?
44
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,400
That’s where I attack!
45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,270
It’s no use, I’m wearing ear plugs.
46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,510
No, this is the end!
47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,040
Oh?!
48
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,520
The human body is made up of 70% water,
and water is able to transmit sound waves.
49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,230
In other words, your whole body is like
one big ear.
50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,900
And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!
51
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,840
Lord Orochimaru…no, Orochimaru!
52
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,510
I’ll have you know that...
I’m more than a mere guinea pig.
53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,680
Are you all right?
54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,190
I-I want to eat meat…
55
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,060
Oh man...
And the guy went easy on him, too.
56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,660
Although he lost, the least we can
do for him is take him for some BBQ beef.
57
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,930
It’s finally over.
58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,330
At long last, the Final Round…
59
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,810
With this, the preliminaries for
the third exam is completed.
60
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:28,510
A Shadow in Darkness:
Danger Approaches Sasuke
61
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,390
I wonder what’s happened to Naruto?
62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,060
Let’s go outside now.
63
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,690
Iruka Sensei hasn’t been alert recently,
so now’s our chance.
64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,760
Hey!
65
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,330
Konohamaru!
66
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,700
You intend to sneak out again, do you?
67
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,940
I-I need to go to the bathroom!
68
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,300
Liar!
69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,170
To everyone who has advanced to
the Final Round
70
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,180
of the third test of the Chunin Exams,
71
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,510
there’s one person who’s missing,
but, congratulations.
72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,450
Sensei…
73
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Hmm?
74
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,520
I have a question.
75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,560
About Sasuke?
76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,090
Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t know much.
77
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,530
But don’t worry too much.
78
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,300
From here on, it’s up to Sasuke.
79
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
Sakura, I have to step out
for a moment.
80
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,040
Please inquire about the
details of the Final Round!
81
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,280
Sure.
82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,390
Here, in our house,
including Sasuke who’s not here,
83
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,550
we have five Leaf,
84
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,360
three Sand,
85
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,530
and one Sound.
86
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,270
Well, I will begin the explanation
of the Final Round.
87
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,500
Finally!
88
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,510
The preliminary battles have
ended without incident.
89
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,310
It seems they’re now entering
the Final Round.
90
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,520
This land really has become
peaceful, hasn’t it?
91
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,990
This peaceful time has put
this country in slumber...
92
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,690
while all the other lands are busy racing
to expand their military.
93
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,430
Would it be possible for us
to take it now?
94
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,530
Humph, I suppose.
95
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,370
Though, I don’t know how much fun
it would be to take out that old man.
96
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,570
Is that so?
97
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,320
To me, it looks like you are still have
a hesitation about it.
98
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,350
From now on, the power of
each Hidden Village will clash
99
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,350
with one another in a long
and violent manner.
100
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,620
The Sound village is also one of them…
101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,530
You intend to be the trigger
for all of that…
102
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,530
And use him for a bullet.
103
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,770
Our Sasuke…right?
104
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,510
You guess well.
105
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,240
So well that it’s a bit creepy.
106
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,510
Not in the slightest.
107
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,350
I still had no idea about
Dosu, Zaku or Kin.
108
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,320
In gathering information on Sasuke,
109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,390
I desired to learn their skills
110
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,160
and carried out tactless things like
deliberately subjecting myself to an attack.
111
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,430
You overestimated me.
112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,630
It seems that you…
113
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,040
you don’t trust me completely…yet.
114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,170
Was it necessary to tell you,
my right-hand man,
115
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,510
about the likes of those three?
116
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,650
You see, therein lies
the very proof of my trust.
117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,620
And because I do…
118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,530
I would like to leave Sasuke
in your hands.
119
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,860
The Curse Mark that was given to him…
120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,100
appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.
121
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,600
Though, that won’t matter much.
122
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,940
While there is still some
darkness left in his heart…
123
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,540
I want you to abduct him.
124
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,710
That’s an uncharacteristically
hasty request, is it not?
125
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,520
There’s a little something troubling me…
126
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,020
Is it Naruto Uzumaki?
127
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,530
You’re quite a sharp one,
aren’t you?
128
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,870
Sasuke has lived for revenge
against his older brother Itachi,
129
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,870
and will not rest until he
has achieved that aim.
130
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,940
Nevertheless, in battle with me,
131
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,540
he was aware that there were things
beyond his power and
132
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,680
faced death without fear.
133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,210
I didn’t think he’d be the type of
person who would be in a hurry to die.
134
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,780
According to your information,
135
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:05,490
contact with that Nine-Tailed kid has
altered Sasuke’s heart and mind.
136
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,030
So much so, that he possesses
some influence over Sasuke.
137
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,060
The best thing to do is to get Sasuke
away from him immediately…
138
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,570
And quickly turn him in my color.
139
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,410
Well, then…
140
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,450
Kabuto…
141
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,520
You...
142
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,150
If you wish to stop me…
143
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,530
You have no choice
but to kill young Sasuke, now.
144
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,070
You can’t possibly kill me…
145
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,540
Though you are strong, you’re only
in the same league as Kakashi.
146
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,990
Just kidding…
147
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,290
Now, run along.
148
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,660
I trust you.
149
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,530
That face…
150
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,070
I wonder what could possibly
be going on in his head?
151
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,970
The Final Round is where
each one of you
152
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,510
will show off your battle skills
in front of everyone.
153
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,510
I want you to satisfactorily demonstrate
and show off your ability
154
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,110
as representative battle forces
of your respective lands.
155
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,450
Accordingly, the Final Round will
commence one month from now.
156
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,320
W-We’re not going to
do it here, right now?
157
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,830
This is so that there’s
a suitable period of preparation.
158
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,790
What do you mean?
159
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,660
That is to say…
160
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,470
Along with the announcement of
the conclusion
161
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,270
of the preliminary match to each
country’s Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,
162
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,170
readying the summons for
Final Round requires preparation time—
163
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,640
not to mention the time it takes
for you examinees to prepare.
164
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,010
This old man always has such
a roundabout way of saying things.
165
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,520
I don’t quite get what
you’re trying to say.
166
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,820
What do you mean?
167
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,550
In other words,
in order to know your adversary,
168
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
in order to prepare yourself,
time is necessary.
169
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,930
Time to analyze what you learned about
the adversaries in the preliminaries...
170
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,530
time to take stock of your successes.
171
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,430
The battles until now were
like actual battles-
172
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,970
it presupposed situations in which
you can’t know your adversary.
173
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,100
That’s for sure…
174
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,510
I never dreamed that this guy
could make sand into a weapon.
175
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,010
However, this is not the case
in the Final Round.
176
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,480
Some of you might have already
revealed everything in front of your rivals…
177
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,550
In the spirit of fairness and equality,
178
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,190
you will have a month to
train yourself to further your skills.
179
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,740
Now, I can’t be thinking of this
180
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,510
as some sort of month-long
holiday and do nothing! Believe it!
181
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,610
Seriously! Seriously!
182
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,200
It might not be good idea to
excel too much, is it?
183
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,500
We failed to stay out of Orochimaru’s
watchful eye,
184
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,270
and it was unfortunate for us both.
185
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,770
Under this gentle exterior,
a seed of evil took root –
186
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,910
and it was this seed that was exploited…
187
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,510
Some day, through that Ninjutsu…
188
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,580
this child will as well…
189
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Kabuto…
190
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,790
Who knows?
191
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,930
Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.
192
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,940
I have to give it you, Kakashi…
193
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,510
Stopping my attack from your blind spot…
194
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,520
But, you’d better ready at least
10 of your men next time.
195
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,530
The Anbu that I prepared were
taken out without difficulty…
196
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,230
You’re not an ordinary Genin are you?
197
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,500
You caught a whiff of me and immediately
readied your weapon…
198
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
you’re quite impressive.
199
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,440
No, I’m not all that.
200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,540
What do you want with Sasuke?
201
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,710
Depending on circumstances,
I’ll haul you off to questioning.
202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,720
I wonder if that’s possible
for the likes of you…
203
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,450
Are you looking to take me on?
204
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,360
You are the son of the chief of the
Leaf medical corps, aren’t you?
205
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,900
Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?
206
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,140
Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?
207
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,310
If you arrest me here now,
208
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,680
you might never be able to prove
my connection to Orochimaru.
209
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,580
Shut up and confine your answers
to my questions.
210
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,650
What if I say “No”?
211
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,720
I’m the one asking the
questions around here.
212
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,620
Now give me some answers.
213
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,690
You’ll find out before long anyway
if you let me go,
214
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,160
so can you make an exception
just this once?
215
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,530
You, willful little brat…
216
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,730
Don’t mess around with grown-ups.
217
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,370
Don’t be so arrogant.
218
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,510
The circumstances are in my favor…
219
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,070
I should have known.
220
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,510
A shadow clone!
221
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,400
Darn…I've let him escape.
222
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,740
Impressive…
223
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,080
As I suspected...
224
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,880
This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,
225
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,890
where one temporarily animates
and controls the heart of a dead body.
226
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,520
Meticulously transforming even the face…
227
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,760
and also stopping his heartbeats
and eliminating all traces of his body odor…
228
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,630
in order to prepare an escape by
impersonating a murdered Anbu…
229
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,810
He wasn't raised as the adopted son of
the chief of the medical corps for nothing.
230
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,640
If someone this good is working
for Orochimaru…
231
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,980
I can’t stay as I am now…
232
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,650
Now that that’s done…
233
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,020
I’d like to let you take your leave…
234
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,520
But first, for the Final Round,
235
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,930
there is one more important
matter to take care of.
236
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,400
Let’s get on with it,
so we can get to training!
237
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,530
Now, now. I want you all to
calmly take one slip of paper
238
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,200
from the box that Anko is holding.
239
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,640
I’m going to go around in order…
take only one.
240
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,220
Good, everyone has taken
a number.
241
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,120
Then, from left to right, tell me
the number on your slip of paper.
242
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,530
I’m eight.
243
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,760
I’m one.
244
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,100
Seven.
245
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,530
Five.
246
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,730
Three.
247
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,730
Nine.
248
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,530
Two.
249
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,500
Six.
250
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,770
In other words, he has number four.
251
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,140
Uh-huh.
252
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,810
Very well, I will tell you
253
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,940
about how the Final Round
tournament will work.
254
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,450
Huh?
255
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,450
Is that what these
drawing lots were for?
256
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,620
Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.
257
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,650
Yes, sir.
258
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,600
He’s so far away.
259
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,200
Is that all the Final Round is,
a tournament?
260
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,940
Shoot! I have one extra round.
261
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,510
Vendetta for Choji?
Give me a break!
262
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,180
I’m so relieved to know that
I won’t be in the same section as Gaara.
263
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,310
Sasuke Uchiha…
264
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,480
Perfect.
265
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,490
Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?
266
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
This couldn’t be better!
Believe it!
267
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,590
Sasuke has to go up against him…?
268
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,030
Could I ask a question?
269
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,200
Go ahead.
270
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,570
Does this mean that there will
only be one winner of the tournament?
271
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,310
That only one of us will be
able to become a Chunin?
272
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,510
No, on the contrary.
273
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,450
The judges of the Final Round,
of which I am one,
274
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,680
will be made up of the Kazekage,
275
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,550
the Daimyo from various countries
who will assign you your missions,
276
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,660
and the Shinobi Leaders.
277
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,860
Through this tournament,
278
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,230
these judges will be able to make
a thorough evaluation,
279
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,430
and come to a decision as to
whether each one of you
280
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,330
possesses the qualities incumbent
of a Chunin.
281
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,170
Even if someone loses the first round,
they can still become a Chunin.
282
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,410
So there’s a chance that all
of us will become Chunin?
283
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,450
Correct, but conversely,
there’s also a chance that none of you will.
284
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,520
To “advance” in the tournament,
285
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,490
means maximizing chances
to appeal yourselves to the judges.
286
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,390
Understood, Shikamaru?
287
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,530
This is all a real pain in my…
288
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,230
Thank you for your patience.
289
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,500
We will adjourn until next month.
290
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,910
The second round will either be
No Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?
291
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,540
That guy is so strong he kicked
Bushy Brow’s butt.
292
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,650
Sand Coffin!
293
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,290
I want to fight you, too.
294
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,530
Now that it’s come to this,
I’ve got to see Kakashi Sensei.
295
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,330
Umm, where’s the room
that Sasuke’s in?
296
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,700
I’m sorry. Mr. Sasuke
is not allowed visitors.
297
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,410
What?! Hey, hey!
What's up with that?!
298
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,870
I’m sorry, those are the rules.
299
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,510
Why, Sis, tell me why?
300
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,310
Naruto, this is a hospital.
Keep it down.
301
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,510
Kakashi Sensei!
302
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,880
Say! Say!
303
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,450
I’ve got a favor to ask!
304
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,850
You don’t need to say it all.
305
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,350
Well, I thought it would
come to this so…
306
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I searched for someone
to watch your training.
307
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,260
Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
308
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,530
I have some matters to take care of.
309
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,130
I don’t have the time to trouble
myself with you.
310
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Oh! Aha...!
311
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,970
You’re going to train
Sasuke, aren’t you!
312
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,540
Well, don't say that.
313
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,510
I found a sensei who’s
more reliable than I am!
314
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,450
Well…who is it?
315
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,120
It’s me!
316
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,150
Huh?
317
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,220
You!
318
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,160
The Closet Perve!
319
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,520
Such insolence!
320
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,130
Hey, can you hear it?
321
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:36,510
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
322
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:46,320
The ocean spans limitlessly
323
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Please keep that smile on your face forever
324
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,260
Or else I’ll cry
325
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,400
You won't have to search around you
326
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,940
It’s all ok now.
327
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:17,780
Everyone is inside
this hand
328
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,350
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
329
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,690
When you forget what happiness is
330
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,530
Just sing.
331
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,970
Light is born, and darkness was born
332
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,300
The two are one
333
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
334
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,280
Hey, can you hear it?
335
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,820
Darn! I’m not satisfied with this!
336
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,020
I don't care if you’re elite tutor
or whatever,
337
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,330
but there’s no way
I’m not going to get stronger
338
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,460
if I’m to learn from the Closet Perve
weaker than me!
339
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,600
I have to get strong by any
means necessary, no matter what!
340
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,270
If you’re really a strong ninja,
341
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,500
just try to convince me
with your sheer strength!
342
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,510
Next episode: “Ebisu Returns:
Naruto’s Toughest Training Yet!”
343
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,010
I’m gonna win this time around, too!
//%

00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,450
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,360
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,460
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,230
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,400
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,650
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,280
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,690
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,760
It will come, closer
11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,660
Now
12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,210
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,640
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,480
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,920
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,650
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,990
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,430
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm going...
20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,660
to become the Hokage.
21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,460
I can’t lose here!
22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,900
You? Hokage?!
23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,660
When you’re weaker than me?
24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,640
I’ll become... Hokage for you!
25
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,910
Transform!
26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,450
Hey hey, are you serious?
27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,650
You’ve been here three years
28
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,650
and you can’t even do
a respectable transformation?!
29
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,550
All of you watch now!
30
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,190
I will absolutely someday become
the true and a real Hokage!
31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,670
Lame! What Hokage?!
32
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,040
You know deep down inside that
you can’t become the Hokage.
33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,070
So quit acting tough!
34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,880
You’re wrong Kiba…
35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,500
If you compete with me for
the name of Hokage…
36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,940
You... will be the loser!
37
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,650
Surprise Attack!
Naruto's Surprise Weapon!
38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Man! Same thing over and over again.
You're pesky!
39
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,200
Well, never mind.
40
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,540
I’ll just make it so
you won’t stand up again!
41
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,740
Let’s go, Akamaru!
42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,070
You think you can get me with
that same technique again?!
43
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,640
Take this!
44
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,930
Darn!
45
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,670
Fang Over Fang!
46
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,450
This Jutsu…
47
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,280
Though, I’ve seen it before…
48
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,150
it’s not a Jutsu you can dodge
over and over!
49
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,690
What do I do?
50
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,920
What should I do?!
51
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,940
Looks like you’ve got nothing left.
52
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,370
I’ve got plenty left!
53
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Even if you increased yourself by
three or four, I’d still have a lot left!
54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,850
You’ve got a comeback
for everything!
55
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,450
Let’s finish him with the next!
Akamaru!
56
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,400
Darn!
57
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,900
I have to counterattack somehow.
58
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,610
Even if I do, it has to get Kiba
or there’s no point!
59
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,650
But which is which…?
60
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,290
W-What will you do? Naruto!
61
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,660
Naruto…
62
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,700
T-That’s it!
63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,770
Transform!
64
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,910
You’re mine!
65
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,650
I see how it is…
66
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,920
Huh?
67
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,650
There, look closely.
68
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,220
Oh!
69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,870
You did it!
70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,870
That’s a clever move, Naruto!
71
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,640
Naruto!
72
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,940
If he transforms into Kiba,
73
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,950
the real Kiba doesn’t know which is
Akamaru and which is Naruto…
74
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,650
He can’t attack carelessly.
75
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,850
However, it’s okay for Naruto
to attack either one!
76
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,490
Oooh!
77
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,690
He created a chance opening…
78
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,430
Good work!
79
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,860
I see, so that’s your move…
80
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,530
But…
81
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,030
I’ll give you a piece of advice!
82
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,870
I was careless before and
a little late to realize it…
83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,710
But the Transformation Jutsu
isn’t effective anymore!
84
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,740
Why, you ask?
85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,540
Yeah!
86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,580
I can smell you.
87
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,020
Don’t mess with our
sense of smell, Naruto.
88
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,660
By concentrating his Chakra
into his nose,
89
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,670
Kiba’s sense of smell is enhanced tens
of thousands times more than average.
90
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,270
Of course, he can determine
people by their smell too.
91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,270
Heh, I won!
92
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,310
W-What?!
93
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,920
What's going on?!
94
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,650
Kiba’s nose got Naruto and
Akamaru mixed up?
95
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,690
Darn! What in the world is going on…?!
96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,870
Then you’re Naruto!
97
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,400
Messing with me!
98
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,410
What?!
99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,780
Well, this is coming from
the original prankster, after all…
100
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,420
He’s had it!
101
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,970
He did it!
102
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,270
Naruto… Awesome!
103
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,520
Darn it!
104
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,690
So that’s it…
105
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Naruto, transformed into Kiba,
106
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,560
was discovered by the real Kiba
with smell and hit…
107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,900
But Naruto didn’t come back
in true Naruto form.
108
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,640
Instead, he transformed into
Akamaru instantly!
109
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
In order to make it look as if it
was Akamaru who was hit
110
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,550
and his impersonation
transformation dissolved!
111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,650
Was Naruto ever that smart…?
112
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,350
You little…!
113
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,290
Think hard about your Jutsu
before you use them!
114
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,300
Because they’ll be used
against you, stupid!
115
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,700
He’s using my line, word to word…
116
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,410
Arguing with this guy is only
a waste of time!
117
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,510
Don’t go at Naruto’s pace…
118
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,880
Calm down.
119
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,110
Calm down!
120
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,850
He can’t actually keep up with
my movements yet…
121
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,860
I still have the advantage!
122
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,660
Look closely at Naruto’s movements
and if there’s an opening…
123
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,900
I can surely take him from
behind with the All-Four Jutsu.
124
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,740
Nothing to get flustered about…
125
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,640
If I do this in a level-headed manner,
it’s a match I will most certainly win!
126
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,880
Evidently your enemy
has become calm…
127
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,780
Well, what will you do, Naruto…?
128
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,950
So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
129
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,290
Well then... I’ll end this…
130
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,860
with my new special technique
I’ve been saving up!
131
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,640
So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
132
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,070
Well then... I’ll end this…
133
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,140
with my new special technique
I’ve been saving up!
134
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,410
What?!
135
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,720
New special trick?!
136
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,650
Huh? When did he…?!
137
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,660
Leave it to Naruto to hide
a new technique!
138
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,660
What new special technique!
139
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,360
That’s obviously a bluff!
140
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,960
You can test out whether
it’s a bluff or not!
141
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,530
This hasn’t changed since before…
142
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,400
Don’t let his pace get to you.
143
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,670
Calm down!
144
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,510
Let’s go!
145
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,940
I don’t know what kind of
technique this is but…!
146
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,610
I just won’t let you do it!
147
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,650
Now!
148
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,520
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…
All-Four Jutsu!
149
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,460
Q-Quick…
150
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,670
Why are you stopping?!
151
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,410
Naruto!
152
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,640
Naruto!
153
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,790
Just as I thought, this is as
far as he will go.
154
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,660
Stand up! Naruto!
155
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,100
D-Darn! I don’t even have time
to work up my Chakra!
156
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,070
Hey hey! What’s wrong?!
157
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,070
Naruto!
158
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,810
He’s fast!
159
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,710
It’s no good.
160
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,650
He doesn’t have time to
form hand Signs!
161
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,320
There’s too much of a difference
in their strength…
162
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,650
It’s impossible for Naruto, after all.
163
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,960
Naruto…
164
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,670
D-Darn!
165
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,340
Take this!
166
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,050
What?!
167
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,650
Take that!
168
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,670
I’m going to be Hokage!
169
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,240
I won’t lose here!
170
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,570
Whatever! You can’t keep up
with my speed at all!
171
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,360
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!
172
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,670
Naruto!
173
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,640
This is what it’s like when
I really let it out.
174
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,190
You understand, don’t you?
175
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,360
To me, you’re merely…!
176
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,690
I...
177
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,960
Huh?
178
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,660
will absolutely not lose!
179
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,540
That Naruto… He’s a fighter.
180
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,240
Yup.
181
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,680
If I were Kiba,
I’d be sick of this already.
182
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,910
It doesn’t matter which anymore,
I just wish they’d settle it quickly.
183
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,720
Naruto...
184
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,650
Fight!
185
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,150
Naruto! Use the new technique
or whatever!
186
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,320
Just settle it!
187
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,660
Naruto! Go for it!
188
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,700
I have to find some opening
in that darn Kiba…
189
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,440
You’ve got absolutely no effect on me!
190
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,080
You’ve got spirit, I’ll give you that!
191
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,050
He’s close at his end…
192
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,850
I’ll settle it with the next one!
193
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,020
I’ll make the new technique
explode no matter what!
194
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,650
I won’t let you!
195
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,690
You’re slow!
196
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,790
Take this!
197
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,230
Oops!
198
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,910
Fast movements and a keen nose…
199
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,650
The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry
turned out to be harmful…
200
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,920
Right now Kiba’s sense of smell
is tens of thousands times
201
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,650
more powerful than normal…
202
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,660
Well…
203
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,660
That fart was probably
a freak accident, but…
204
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,330
That’s what you’d expect from
the number one unpredictable Ninja.
205
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,730
Naruto!
206
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,170
Now’s your chance!
207
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,640
Darn!
I was straining too much…
208
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,740
But now’s the time to show
my new technique!
209
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,310
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
210
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,650
Naruto!
211
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,920
Okay! The way you’ve torn me
apart up until now,
212
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,450
I’ll give it back all at once!
213
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,330
D-Darn it!
214
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,900
U-!
215
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,640
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
216
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,120
Naruto... Barrage!
217
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,310
A new technique, eh?
218
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,650
Well, he was watching Sasuke’s
technique a moment ago…
219
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,820
Lion Barrage!
220
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,660
For the record, the name
is a rip off, too.
221
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,020
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
222
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,750
Ohhhh!
223
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,650
Cha!
224
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,060
Nice one!
225
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,560
You did it!
226
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,090
That Naruto beat Kiba!
227
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,500
It’s a major upset…
228
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,260
Yup!
229
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:16,970
Yes!
230
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,420
I’m…getting stronger!
231
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,930
That was easy!
232
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,330
W-What to do?
233
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,370
What should I do…?
234
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
N-Naruto...
235
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,180
Huh? Hinata?
236
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,540
Did you say something?
237
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,280
Ah, ah, ah… 					Umm…
238
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,660
Huh?
239
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,460
Hinata…?
240
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,100
What's this?
241
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,640
It’s an ointment.
242
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,770
Why for me?
243
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,810
Take it for her, Naruto.
244
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,990
Hmmm. Okay!
245
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,360
Thank you! You’re nice, Hinata!
246
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,300
Kiba, it’s nothing to be
embarrassed about …
247
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
This kid was a really
strong opponent.
248
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,920
You are taking this pretty easy,
aren’t you, Lady Hinata…?
249
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, can you hear it?
250
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:35,570
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
251
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:45,150
The ocean spans limitlessly
252
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:53,460
Please keep that smile on your face forever
253
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,030
Or else I’ll cry
254
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,230
You won't have to search around you
255
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,770
It’s all ok now.
256
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:16,650
Everyone is inside
this hand
257
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,190
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
258
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,660
When you forget what happiness is
259
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,560
Just sing.
260
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,830
Light is born, and darkness was born
261
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,170
The two are one
262
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:44,610
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
263
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,110
Hey, can you hear it?
264
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,650
What’s with that guy!
265
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,460
Calling people failure and judging them!
266
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,230
Blah blah blah blah blah blah!
Talking like a wise guy!
267
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,530
I’m in a bad mood!
268
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,660
Hinata, you say something!
269
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,060
Get that guy!
270
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,440
Show that guy that people
can really change!
271
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,270
Next episode:
“Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!”

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,990
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,610
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4

Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,610
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,610
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,110
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,400
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:51,780
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,070
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,650
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,650
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,450
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,740
For a start, wake up
that medium kid.
21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,950
It will release that Jutsu!
22
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,570
How do we go about waking him?!
23
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,490
Give him a good punch!
24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,940
But with that said…
25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,940
I’m not particularly good
at transformations…
26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,900
Huh?
27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,940
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!
28
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,280
Time for a combined transformation!
29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,820
We got to have fangs and claws!
Let’s go!
30
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,360
Transform!
31
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,900
Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light
32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,940
F-Fox…?
33
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,150
What a battle…
34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,240
I can’t call this place safe either, huh…
35
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,940
Darn it!
36
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,110
His power is increasing
more and more!
37
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,740
Chief! We got to hurry up and rouse
that guy out of his sleep!
38
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,490
I know that!
39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,610
Here goes…!
40
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
Go to hell!
41
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,030
All right! Now!
42
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,940
Okay!
43
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,070
Wake the hell up!
44
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,940
You jerk…
45
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,820
All right!
46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,700
Not that much time has passed
since the medium went to sleep!
47
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,900
In that state,
one blow should be enough!
48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,940
Darn!
49
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,400
It hasn’t been long since I emerged!
50
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
The Jutsu has been dissolved!
51
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,940
Even if the Playing Possum Jutsu
is dissolved,
52
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,940
he’s still putting on the pressure?
53
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,610
That guy interfered with my Jutsu…?!
54
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,360
Sand Coffin!
55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,650
– Pop! 					– Yeah!
56
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,940
It’s the chief’s tongue…
57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,940
Don’t take me for a fool!
58
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,820
Darn!
59
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,030
What kind of strength
does this guy possess?
60
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,700
This doesn’t look good…!
61
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,950
Both Naruto and I have already
completely disgorged our Chakra!
62
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,030
You will be killed by me!
I will not cease to exist!
63
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,110
Leaf Hurricanes!
64
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,200
Besides just the Sound Ninja,
I wouldn’t have imagined that
65
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,450
this many of the Sand Jonin
would enter into the village, too!
66
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,240
Well, it’s understandable.
This is what is called war.
67
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,450
It’s taking much too long.
68
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,940
It’s impossible for a battle
between Shinobi to last this long.
69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
What the heck is happening inside?
70
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,490
You’re still grabbing my arm…
71
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,240
I can’t use my Jutsu this way…
72
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,900
Come on,
let go of me once and for all.
73
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,150
I’m not letting your ambitions
interfere with the village…any longer…
74
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,530
There’s no stopping my ambitions!
You will die here!
75
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,360
You old dotard…
76
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,950
As the Third Hokage,
77
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,700
are you saying you still have
the power to save this village?
78
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,360
Do you understand…
the current situation?!
79
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,400
Many Hidden Sand Shinobi and
my subordinates
80
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,400
have infiltrated this village.
81
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,200
Your side…the Leaf Shinobi…
82
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,820
will be annihilated down to
every last woman and child!
83
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I will accomplish the destruction
of the Hidden Leaf Village!
84
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,650
It’s empty inside!
85
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,900
There’s nobody there!
86
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,610
That’s very strange…
87
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,780
Huh?
88
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Why is there so little resistance
when we’ve closed in
89
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,490
all the way to the center
of the Hidden Leaf Village?
90
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,150
That’s…
91
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,940
And also…there’s not one woman
or child in sight.
92
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,280
What is the reason for that?
93
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,650
Huh?!
94
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,070
Konohamaru…?
95
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,700
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
96
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,940
I gotta use the toilet.
97
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,990
M-Me too…
98
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,940
I do too…
99
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,360
K-Konohamaru…!
100
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,400
This is an emergency situation!
101
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,030
If the enemy finds us,
it will cost us!
102
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,940
Go back to the other room
and stay quiet!
103
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,450
I-It’s not that… I gotta pee!
104
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,900
Hold it!
105
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,200
I don’t think I can hold it…
106
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,490
Gimme a break.
ln that case, come along with me…
107
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
Can't hold it!
108
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,570
Can't! Can't hold…!
109
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,150
That’s…
110
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,360
At last, huh…
111
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,650
I’ll get revenge for you
no matter what…
112
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Hayate.
113
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,740
That’s the signal. Let’s go!
114
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,610
Roger!
115
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,940
You don’t get it, do you, Orochimaru?
116
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,940
Don’t underestimate the Shinobi
of this Village!
117
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,150
Are you all right?
118
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,530
Yeah…
119
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,490
Is that…the last?
120
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,900
Yes, the evacuation is complete!
121
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,530
W-What’s happening?
122
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,530
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
has an instruction manual
123
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,780
outlining what to do in case of
a sneak attack by the enemy.
124
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Step One:
Eliminate the enemy’s sneak attack force.
125
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,940
In case one is unable
to eliminate them,
126
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,740
proceed immediately to Step Two.
127
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,990
The immediate evacuation
of noncombatants!
128
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,030
Evacuate the women and children
to shelters around the village!
129
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,530
When that has been completed,
proceed to Step Three!
130
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,530
Step Three…?
131
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Through the collective strength
and efforts of the Village,
132
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,280
eliminate the enemy!
133
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,740
In that case…!
134
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,940
The counteroffensive…starts now!
135
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,570
We will not allow you to take
even one step beyond this point!
136
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
Sakura!
137
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,400
Rescue Sakura,
if it’s the last thing you do!
138
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,240
I’ll protect Sakura no matter what!
139
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,400
You will be killed by me.
I will not cease to exist.
140
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,940
My back is against the wall…
141
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,780
I have to hurry up
and stop that Demon Raccoon…
142
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,360
Please…
143
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,570
Just a small amount is fine…
144
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,650
Give me…
145
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,940
some Chakra!
146
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,740
What are you doing…?
There’s only one opponent!
147
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,490
Hyuga is the magnum force
of the Leaf Village.
148
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,940
Don’t forget that!
149
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,940
M-My…body…is immobilized…
150
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,280
Is this the first time
you’re experiencing
151
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,940
the Leaf’s hidden technique,
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
152
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,860
Well, take this too while I’m at it…
153
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,320
The Leaf’s hidden technique…
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
154
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,900
Expansion Jutsu!
155
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,950
Mind Destruction Jutsu!
156
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,780
W-What’s this?!
157
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,200
My body is…all on its own…!
158
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,780
S-Stop…
159
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,150
Stop!
160
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,450
Reminds me of the old days!
161
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,860
Yeah!
162
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,400
The original Ino-Shika-Cho Trio reunites!
163
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,400
Kuromaru…let’s go!
164
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,320
Right!
165
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,070
In order to protect the village,
166
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,530
all the Leaf Shinobi will risk
their lives fighting!
167
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:30,940
Real strength doesn't lie
in the mastering of all Jutsu!
168
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,490
The poison in my body is…
169
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,360
Don’t move, Shino.
I inserted my Parasitic Insects.
170
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,780
They are removing the poison.
171
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,400
Dad…
172
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,990
I believe I taught this
to you too, in the past…
173
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,940
It is when one protects
someone important…
174
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,200
that the true strength of
the Shinobi will emerge!
175
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,780
I will protect everyone!
176
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,940
Here I come! You idiot raccoon!
177
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,280
Die…!
178
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
Darn…
179
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,820
Darn it!
180
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,950
D-Did he win…?
181
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,940
A simple head blow…
182
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,940
His manner of fighting
is incredibly clumsy,
183
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,940
but to think that he could squeeze out
Chakra at that critical stage.
184
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,490
I’ve never seen a knucklehead Ninja
like him before, but…
185
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,700
he sure is the first phenomenal kid
I’ve seen in a long time.
186
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,490
It’s too bad that I can’t see this through
to the end,
187
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,940
but I’ve reached my limit.
188
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,940
Gamakichi, let’s head home!
189
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,820
Okay! Pop!
190
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,940
As might be expected, even I…
am empty now…
191
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,240
You are too, aren’t you?
192
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,450
We’re much alike…
let’s make this time the last!
193
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,860
It appears that…
194
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:14,610
I don’t have the strength left
to yank out your entire soul.
195
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,940
However, your ambition ends here!
196
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,030
Not yet!
197
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,030
There’s no stopping my ambition!
198
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,030
I have a suitable punishment for you
199
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,820
who have become addicted to the Jutsu
and who have overindulged in the Jutsu!
200
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,570
I will take all your Jutsu away with me!
201
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,780
What did you say?!
202
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,150
There!
203
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,940
Don’t tell me that..?
204
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,030
Stop that!
205
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,940
Seal!
206
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,950
My…My arms…
207
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,610
Now…you can no longer use
either of your arms.
208
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,570
And since you can’t use your arms,
you can’t weave Signs.
209
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,950
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
210
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,110
Your ambition of crushing
the Hidden Leaf…dies right here!
211
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,610
You old dotard!
Give me back my arms!
212
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,360
Orochimaru, you fool…
213
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,950
It’s unfortunate that
we can’t leave together,
214
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,950
but, my disciple…
215
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,070
let’s meet in the other world one day.
216
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,320
You old dotard…
whose life is hanging by a thread!
217
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,990
How dare you!
How dare you take away my Jutsu!
218
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,280
In places where the Leaf dances,
a fire burns…
219
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,940
The shadow of the fire
will illuminate the Village…
220
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,940
And once more the Leaf will sprout …
221
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,940
A cycle of hardship, right?
222
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,940
Inside, we were crying, right?
223
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:40,360
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
224
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
It's a secondary role,
225
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,030
a role in the shadows
226
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,820
But in reaching for that dream,
227
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,940
Lord Third Hokage…
228
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,940
The ambition that you had
seems to have been passed on
229
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,780
to the young Shinobi
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
230
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,400
The flame in their hearts will
burn large and strong in the future.
231
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,650
And someday,
they will illuminate this Village…
232
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,940
just as you have done for us!
233
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,610
Next time:
"The Third Hokage, Forever…"

Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,510
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,840
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:58,180

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
What’s the matter?
21
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,970
After pursuing me like that,
what’s up with you?
22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,430
You’re not even able to touch me…
23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,470
What a laugh!
24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,260
Sakura…
25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,510
I don’t know how far I can go, but…
26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,050
I have to give it…my best shot!
27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Naruto’s Ninja Handbook
28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,760
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
29
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,680
Here goes!
30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,300
From this moment on,
Secret Ultimate Taijutsu technique!
31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,760
Naruto Uzumaki…
Clone Body Slam!
32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,840
– Now! 					– Now!
33
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,050
Okay!
34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,840
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
35
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,100
Once again…
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
36
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,840
Take this!
37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,850
Leaf Village Secret Ultimate
Taijutsu technique
38
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,550
learned from Kakashi Sensei!
39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,850
A Thousand Years of Death!
40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,010
An enema?
41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,350
Boom.
42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,430
Sasuke…?
43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
That was a splendid blow.
44
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,930
D-Did that get him?
45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,600
Gaara…
46
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,840
Doing all that work…
And managing just one blow, huh?
47
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,260
S-Shut up!
48
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,760
He attacked the base of the tail
which has the weakest defense…
49
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,180
Even though I’m not wounded,
I can’t absorb the impact.
50
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,600
Did I underestimate him too much?
51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,890
Hey, Naruto…
52
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,100
Sakura… Go rescue her
if it’s the last thing you do!
53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,800
And after you’ve rescued her…
54
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,850
take Sakura and
lose no time in fleeing.
55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,550
You, if anyone, can do it!
56
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,840
Sasuke… You…
57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,890
I still have the ability…
to hold him in check for a while.
58
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,350
If things end here…
59
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,850
it would just mean that
was the extent of the man I am.
60
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,140
I lost everything once…
61
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,840
I don’t want to see…
62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,930
any precious comrades die
right before my eyes again.
63
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,970
Precious…comrades…
64
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,840
I will not allow my comrades…
65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,470
to be killed, no matter what.
66
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,100
I see…
67
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,890
That’s right.
68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,470
Because he resembles me…
69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,720
Because he has gone through life
70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,220
with the same loneliness
and sadness as I have…
71
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,600
That guy who continued to fight
in solitude for himself,
72
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,840
I thought…he was strong.
73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Naruto…
74
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,840
But that’s not the meaning
of true strength…
75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,840
If one fights just for
oneself in solitude…
76
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,840
one can’t really become strong…
77
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,800
Is there someone who
is precious to you?
78
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,680
When a person wants to protect
someone who is precious to him…
79
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,350
it’s then that they truly…
become…strong.
80
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,760
You will…become strong.
81
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,260
He’s releasing such
massive amount of Chakra!
82
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,850
That’s…Naruto?!
83
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,350
No matter what, I will…
84
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,680
protect you!
85
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,850
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
86
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,300
He’s pretty good, this one.
87
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,140
I’ve kept you waiting
a long time!
88
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,840
The spiraling series of Naruto Uzumaki’s
Ninja Handbook starts now!
89
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,840
W-What’s up with this…
large number of clones?!
90
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,840
What the heck is this?
91
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,510
T-This is…amazing!
92
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
You are pretty promising.
93
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
You… This is…
94
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
Sasuke, you get yourself
a good rest.
95
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,100
Leave the rest to Naruto Uzumaki!
96
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,390
This guy is…
97
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,220
All right! Everyone! Here I go!
98
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,050
that Naruto?!
99
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,550
Jump!
100
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,640
Naruto’s…Ninja…Handbook!
101
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,260
Everywhere…
102
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,140
Shuriken!
103
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,010
My body hasn’t fully recovered…
104
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,220
My only choice is to
use Sand as a defense!
105
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,840
– Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki…!
– Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki…!
106
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,300
– Barrage! 					– Barrage!
107
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,470
T-This guy…!
108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,350
– This time, I’ll use both legs…
– This time, I’ll use both legs…
109
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,550
– and go for a 4K Barrage!
– and go for a 4K Barrage!
110
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Who the heck is that…?
Suddenly…
111
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,970
Unbelievable…
To get Gaara in that state…
112
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Where does that strength come from?
113
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,720
No way! 					There's no way…
114
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,010
No way I’ll…lose to…a guy like this…!
115
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,100
W-What’s…that?
116
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,890
It finally…emerged.
117
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,100
The Perfect Possession!
118
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,840
This is…
the monster inside that guy.
119
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,220
I didn’t think you would
expose this form!
120
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,510
Naruto!
121
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,890
Darn…my body…!
122
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,220
My Chakra has…
with all those clones earlier on…
123
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,010
Sakura!
124
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,550
D-Darn…!
125
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,140
I, Inu, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji…
126
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,350
This will mark your end…
127
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,510
– Sand Burial!
– Summoning Jutsu!
128
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,350
It’s amazing that he can utilize
a Summoning Jutsu in that state…
129
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,840
I will protect…
130
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,840
Sakura!
131
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,840
Naruto Uzumaki…
132
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,350
You continue to give me
such pleasure…
133
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Naruto… 					What in the…world…?
134
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,720
My hours of practice
are finally paying off!
135
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,100
I can do it!
136
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
– What is this? 					– Huh?
137
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,350
Not you again!
What in the world do you want?
138
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,260
Huh?!
139
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,010
That must be…
the Shukaku of the Sand.
140
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,470
Chief Toad!
Come join me in this fight!
141
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
No way!
142
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,050
What?!
143
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,300
Why would I go out of my way
and fight a guy like that?
144
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,550
That’s idiotic!
145
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,840
Why?!
146
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,890
You told me the other day that you
would make me your henchman!
147
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,430
It’s only natural for a chief
to help out his henchman!
148
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
That’s respect and duty, right?!
149
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,850
It’s true I told you
I’d make you my henchman…
150
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,010
But we haven’t even exchanged
cups of sake to seal our relationship yet…
151
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,840
Gimme a break! I’m still underage!
152
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,430
I can’t drink alcohol!
153
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,840
Don’t say that and just listen
to what this guy says, Pop!
154
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,430
Huh?! Pop?!
155
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Why are you here, Gamakichi?
156
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,640
I had lots of time on my hands,
so I came to visit…
157
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,510
Huh? Huh?
You’re father and son?
158
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,840
Then that guy over there
tried to bully me!
159
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,930
What was that?!
160
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,890
When that happened,
this guy here rescued me…
161
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,600
He clashed with that monster…
162
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,430
Pretty interesting guy.
163
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,010
I see…
164
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,010
Kid… I recognize you
as my henchman…
165
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,800
and I’ll show you what duty
and respect means!
166
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,840
I’ll make you pay the price
good and proper, you underling!
167
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,350
Hang on tight!
168
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,430
How’s that?!
169
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,050
Awesome…
170
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,430
What a guy…
171
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,840
He’s so heavy,
172
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,220
I could barely manage to
thrust my dagger through him.
173
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,680
If I don’t hurry up,
174
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,840
this battle will change
the shape of the landscape.
175
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,430
Hey! Hey! Chief!
176
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,840
Sakura is over that way,
so don’t move that way!
177
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,100
Please lure him in this direction.
178
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,350
Sakura…?
179
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,430
That’s his girlfriend, Pop.
180
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,600
I’ve got to take that guy down.
181
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,050
Otherwise, I won’t be able
to rescue Sakura!
182
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,970
Interesting!
183
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
This is interesting!
Naruto Uzumaki!
184
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,970
T-This isn’t good!
185
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,100
That Gaara…
He’s intending to do that thing.
186
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,840
I better get out of here!
187
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,550
Huh…? That is…
188
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,220
That’s…the medium…?
189
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,510
To thank you for entertaining me
up to now…
190
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,390
I’ll show you the real power…
191
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,390
of the Sand Spirit!
192
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,300
The circles under his eyes…
193
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,470
Those are symptoms of
insomnia which indicate
194
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,970
that the medium is also possessed
by the Shukaku of the Sand.
195
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,430
Insomnia…?
196
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,720
Those who are possessed
by the Demon Raccoon Shukaku
197
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,140
are unable to sleep soundly
through the entire night.
198
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,550
Because of the terror…
199
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,890
If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowly
eat away at their personality
200
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,890
and eventually that person
is no longer himself.
201
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,430
Because he normally
doesn’t get much sleep…
202
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,850
the medium’s personality
tends to…become unstable.
203
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,050
Oh…
204
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,430
Therefore, usually while
the medium is awake,
205
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,510
the power of Shukaku is
normally controlled.
206
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,840
However…
207
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,840
when that medium sleeps…
208
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,470
Playing Possum Jutsu!
209
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,180
He’s done it…!
210
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,470
W-What’s gonna happen, Chief?
211
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,010
If one sets Playing Possum Jutsu
into motion…
212
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,550
…the Shukaku will appear!
213
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,180
I’m finally able to emerge!
214
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,010
That’s the Shukaku?
215
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,550
He’s pretty funky…
216
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Right away!
The guy I wanna kill! You!
217
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,970
I’m gonna jump…
218
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,850
Huh?
219
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,300
Wind Style: Air Bullets!
220
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,640
Water Style: Water Bullets!
221
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,350
That’s practically a storm…
222
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,390
What kind of a battle is this…?!
223
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,970
Chief! I told you,
not in that direction!
224
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,010
Shut up! I know!
225
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,180
Air Bullets!
226
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,430
Water Bullets!
227
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,430
Too bad…
228
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,680
This isn’t good, Chief!
There's one shot left…!
229
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,680
Yeah! I killed it…
230
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,300
I killed it!
231
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,510
That hurts…!
232
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,640
How dare you shoot me
233
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,890
with bullets containing
stupid amounts of Chakra!
234
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,640
Even I can’t take that many shots!
235
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,470
What should we do?!
236
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,720
For a start,
wake up that medium kid!
237
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,390
It will release that Jutsu!
238
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,970
How do we go about waking him?!
239
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,970
Give him a good punch!
240
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,140
Water Bullets!
241
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,550
Like I’ll take that!
242
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,350
Now!
243
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,640
Chief, I can’t hit him
unless you hold him down!
244
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,430
This Toad doesn’t have fangs or claws
to hold that guy’s movement.
245
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,100
What should we do then?!
246
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,510
We’ll use the Transform Jutsu to
change into something that has those!
247
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,640
But with that said…
248
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,550
I’m not particularly good
at transformations.
249
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,220
Huh?
250
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,470
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!
251
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,840
Whaaaat?!
252
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,720
Time for a combined transformation!
253
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,100
Uh…Okay!
254
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,640
We got to have fangs and claws!
255
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,350
Umm…
256
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,600
Let’s go!
257
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,840
Wait…
Say, w-wait a second…!
258
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,300
F- Fangs and claws… Fangs and claws…
Fangs and claws!
259
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,470
Transform!
260
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,930
Transform Jutsu!
261
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,140
That’s the…!
262
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,720
A cycle of hardship, right?
263
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,680
Inside, we were crying, right?
264
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:39,930
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
265
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,850
It's a secondary role,
266
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,840
a role in the shadows
267
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,390
But in reaching for that dream,
268
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,890
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
269
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,850
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
270
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,840
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
271
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:19,100
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
272
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I don’t know about your past,
and my past doesn’t matter either!
273
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,350
I only have people who I must protect.
274
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,010
Hey you with no eyebrows!
275
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,840
Let’s just end this as similar fighters.
276
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,850
I will finish this with my next hit.
277
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,890
This will be, absolutely and totally,
the last one!
278
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,390
Next time:
“Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light”
//%
1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,290
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,220
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,300
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,100
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,270
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,310
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,550
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,150
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,590
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,590
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,590
Now
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,040
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,510
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,340
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,520
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,850
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:21,260
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,850
And the next match.
20
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,990
This year’s rookie looks challenging…
21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
22
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,400
It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!
23
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,200
What we’ve been waiting for!
24
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,570
It’s finally my turn!
25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,240
Yeah! Lucky us!
26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,310
If it’s this guy,
we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!
27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,180
Show us how much you’ve grown.
28
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,420
I’m going to do it!
29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,600
Akamaru Unleashed!
Who's Top Dog Now?
30
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,530
The seventh battle,
Naruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.
31
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,020
I got sick of waiting!
32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,620
It’s finally time for me to shine!
Believe it!
33
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,620
That’s my line!
34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,790
With you as my opponent,
I’ve as good as won!
35
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,990
Right, Akamaru?
36
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,160
Don’t get excited!
37
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,600
You won’t be able to beat me!
38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,100
Why you little…!
39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,200
Hey! Don’t bring your puppy!
40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,740
He’ll get in the way of the match!
41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,170
You fool!
42
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,910
Akamaru’s going to fight with me.
43
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,580
Hey, hey! Is that okay?
44
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,680
Yes.
45
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,950
Animals and insects are treated
the same as ninja tools.
46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,390
There’s no problem.
47
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,090
Well, that’s fine!
48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
It’s a perfect handicap!
49
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,590
Talking tough!
50
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,930
Then…
51
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Akamaru, don’t put a paw in this.
52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
I’ll fight him by myself!
53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,670
Naruto! Don’t lose to a guy like this!
54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,470
It’s finally come.
55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,680
Naruto, huh?
56
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,580
I’m sorry, but he can’t beat Kiba...
57
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,550
Kakashi.
58
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,950
Naruto...
59
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,220
I-I want to support you, but…
60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,590
Kiba’s on my team…
61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,600
Kiba will get mad…
62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,200
But…
63
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,100
Naruto…
64
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,140
Kiba’s lucky.
65
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,870
Hah!
66
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Hah! I don’t know how strong he’s become
since this guy became a Genin…
67
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,580
Today we’ll run through Transformation Jutsu.
68
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,620
You’ll change yourself into Lord Hokage…
69
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,920
His ability was “that,” so…
70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,960
Transform!
71
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,510
So noisy...
72
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,310
I was sleeping comfortably…
73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,520
T-That was a joke!
I-I did it on purpose!
74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,380
Enough, Naruto!
75
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,590
It’s your third year
at the academy!
76
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,450
Wha--?
77
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,690
Goodness sake, who is that guy?
78
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,960
We’ve just switched to this class
and already found someone funny.
79
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,530
That guy, he’s on a roll.
80
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,600
He’s an attention-seeker, huh?
81
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,100
One more time, fool!
82
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,700
Transform!
83
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,650
You…
84
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,180
Is it possible…?
85
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,960
Hey hey, are you serious?
86
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,230
You’ve been here for three years and
can’t even do a respectable transformation?
87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
All of you watch now!
88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,570
I will absolutely someday become
the true and a real Hokage!
89
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,980
Lame!
90
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,580
What Hokage?!
91
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,560
Some sympathy at the very least…
92
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,920
I’ll do you in, in one clean blow!
93
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,600
Really? But you can’t beat me!
94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,270
I said not to act tough.
95
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,580
Well then. Please begin!
96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,880
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
All-Four Jutsu!
97
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,590
Here I come!
98
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,230
Fast!
99
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,310
It will be a while ‘til
he opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor.
100
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,910
Just as I thought.
101
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,180
That Naruto can’t be equal to Kiba.
102
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,350
Naruto…
103
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,420
That was too embarrassing to watch.
104
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,590
See…
105
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,290
What was that?
That guy is weak.
106
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,330
Naruto!
107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,330
Huh?
108
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,240
Yes, that’s it…
109
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,580
I’ll surpass Hokage!
110
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,590
Then everyone in the village will
acknowledge my existence!
111
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,590
Those are his words…
112
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,530
I’ve always made fun of them, too.
113
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,940
This is the Jonin…a true Ninja…
114
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,570
I have to escape…
115
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,370
If I stay like this…
116
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,580
I’ll really, really be killed!
117
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,380
Are you hurt…
118
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,550
Scaredy cat?
119
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,590
You just need to become
stronger than me!
120
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,630
Darn you!
121
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,470
You!
122
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,040
What are you doing all of a sudden?!
123
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:58,850
T-This stupid coward is...
absolutely... not the Sasuke I know!
124
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,220
Don’t mess with me!
125
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,420
W-What?
126
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,260
But, it was wrong!
127
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,770
Hey...
128
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,570
are you hurt?
129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,580
Scaredy cat?
130
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,720
I won’t change my words,
that’s my way of Ninja!
131
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,740
Naruto...
132
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,180
Say it to everyone!
133
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,980
Don't...
134
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,210
Don't...
135
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,250
underestimate me!
136
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,590
Yeah!
137
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,660
He seems to have grown
to say such thing.
138
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,790
Naruto…!
139
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,800
Go, Naruto!
140
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,530
What are you talking about,
bleeding like that?
141
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,600
Your tough talk has gone too far!
142
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,710
I didn’t use my power fully…
to observe your strength first!
143
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,340
You too, cut out the tough talk
and use the dog or whatever you want!
144
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,150
You’ll regret this…
145
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,580
Let’s go Akamaru!
146
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,590
Smoke Ball?
147
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,590
Take this!
148
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,510
I can’t see!
149
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
This is bad!
150
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,680
I have to get out of the smoke…
or I’ll be done for.
151
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,220
It worked!
152
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,790
What is it…?
153
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,600
Shoot…I can’t see anything.
154
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Yeah! We did it!
155
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,020
Yay! Good job, Akama--!
156
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,400
A-Akamaru…
157
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,600
Why?
158
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,710
Why?
159
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,580
You took the bait!
160
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,920
Y-You!
161
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,850
Transform Jutsu?!
162
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,760
Ouch! Shoot!
163
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,960
Let go!
164
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,130
You smell like a dog!
165
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,660
W-Where’s Akamaru?!
166
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Over here!
167
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,770
Akamaru! Darn!
168
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,570
No way!
169
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,970
That's Naruto?!
170
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,370
An equal match with Kiba…
171
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,340
No, it may be more than equal!
172
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,480
Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu
to Transform Jutsu, that’s a clever trick.
173
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,750
Naruto shouldn’t be able to do that…
174
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,520
His timing at using Jutsu’s is very good.
175
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,360
What? He’s better than I thought.
176
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,230
But, to get mad like that after
biting the opponent himself…
177
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,600
What a funny guy.
178
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,830
N-Naruto…amazing!
179
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,700
That’s amazing, Naruto!
180
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,840
You got a little bit stronger.
181
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,150
But it’s over.
182
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,210
Next, I’ll attack you seriously.
183
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,950
Oh really?!
184
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,750
But you will absolutely not beat me!
185
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,090
During this exam,
he’s matured again.
186
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,560
This is a surprise…
187
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,600
That’s Naruto, the perpetual goof…?
188
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,600
Evidently it’s no longer “that” Naruto.
189
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,570
Yeah.
190
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,140
I wonder, what kind
of trick Kakashi used…?
191
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,580
Still…
192
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:01,890
Huh?
193
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,800
As for the development of
my Kiba and Akamaru,
194
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,160
it's probably more than Naruto.
195
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,570
Naruto…I’ll take Akamaru... back!
196
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,220
W-What's this?!
197
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,990
What did you feed him?
His fur turned red!
198
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,900
That’s why he’s called “Akamaru”, red boy.
199
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,670
Food Pills huh…?
200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,840
That Kiba…
201
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,370
He intends to end it with this.
202
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,970
Here we go, Akamaru!
203
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,610
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…!
204
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,390
Man Beast Clones!
205
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,600
T-There’s something wrong
with their eyes!
206
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
He’s using some weird drug!
207
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,600
Isn’t this doping?
208
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Is this okay?!
209
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,240
Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools.
210
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,470
You, that’s all you say!
211
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,010
What?!
212
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,140
What did that guy eat?
213
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,650
It’s Food Pills.
214
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,680
F-Food Pills?
215
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,220
Food Pills are a secret medicine
that people in the military take
216
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,260
and fight for three days and
three nights without a break…
217
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,660
They’re high in protein,
easily absorbed and
218
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,600
have some types of component
that influence agitation or sedation…
219
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,170
Kiba and Akamaru’s Chakra must
be doubled right now…
220
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,010
It’s over with this…
221
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,240
Let’s go!
222
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,810
All-Four...
223
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,010
Jutsu!
224
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,900
N-Naruto!
225
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,940
That Naruto is in danger!
226
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,140
Kiba’s the gung-ho fighter type
who will attack
227
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,180
like a beast with Chakra wired
throughout his body.
228
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,150
And the Food Pills that double one’s
Chakra are quite simply…
229
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,880
the perfect pill for Kiba.
230
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,750
Naruto…
231
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,590
This isn’t good…
232
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,360
There’s no way to counterattack…
233
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,000
All I can do is gather all
the Chakra in my legs
234
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,660
and do my best to escape…!
235
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,830
At this rate…
236
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,340
Here’s my chance!
237
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,310
Take this!
238
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,110
Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique!
239
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,020
Fang Over Fang!
240
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,000
This is the difference in
our true powers.
241
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm going...
242
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,580
to become the Hokage.
243
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,080
I can’t lose here...!
244
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,790
You? Hokage?!
245
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,850
When you’re weaker than me?
246
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,590
I’ll become Hokage for you!
247
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,410
You know deep down inside
that you can’t become the Hokage.
248
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,510
So quit acting tough!
249
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,720
You’re wrong, Kiba…
250
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,190
Naruto...
251
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,720
He’s not that weak…
252
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,700
I’ll receive the name...
of Lord Hokage!
253
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,540
All of you, just watch!
254
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,940
Naruto, unlike me...
255
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,640
he has always believed in his own worth.
256
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,360
I thought it was really amazing…
257
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,760
It must have been really hard…
258
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,570
I understand that.
259
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,840
And yet before not even one person…
260
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,550
tried to see Naruto.
261
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,960
Hey, that’s the kid…
262
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,560
I heard he’s the only one...
who failed.
263
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,660
Humph! Serves him right!
264
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,700
It’s trouble if a kid like that
becomes a Ninja.
265
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,600
After all, that kid is really…
266
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,870
Stop! Anything further is taboo.
267
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,580
Nobody tried to acknowledge
real Naruto.
268
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,520
Clone Jutsu!
269
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
But now…
270
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,570
Everyone’s watching…
271
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,210
Stand up! Naruto!
272
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,360
Everyone is acknowledging him!
273
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,570
If you compete with me for
the name of Hokage…
274
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,010
You…will be the loser!
275
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,600
Hey, can you hear it?
276
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:34,040
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
277
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:43,650
The ocean spans limitlessly
278
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:51,920
Please keep that smile on your face forever
279
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,600
Or else I’ll cry
280
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,700
You won't have to search around you
281
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,500
It’s all ok now.
282
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:15,350
Everyone is inside
this hand
283
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,680
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
284
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,260
When you forget what happiness is
285
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,060
Just sing.
286
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,530
Light is born, and darkness was born
287
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,630
The two are one
288
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:43,110
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
289
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,580
Hey, can you hear it?
290
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,420
That Kiba, he sure is stupid.
291
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,620
Think hard about your Jutsu
when you use them.
292
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,790
Otherwise, your opponents
will take advantage of the Jutsu.
293
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,600
Well, the outcome of you and me
could be seen from the beginning.
294
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,100
The way you’ve torn me apart
up until now,
295
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,600
I’ll give it back all at once!
296
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,540
Next episode: “Surprise Attack!
Naruto’s Secret Weapon!"
297
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,140
This is the trick I’ve been saving up!
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,060
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,120
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,310
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,480
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,820
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,550
There is no way that I alone can
lose in a place like this!
20
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,590
Guy Sensei…please allow it.
21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,920
It is now…
22
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,900
A time to carry through and protect
one’s own Way of the Ninja!
23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,110
The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born
24
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,980
The color of his body changed…!
25
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,550
He’s red…?!
26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,860
What’s up with him...?!
27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,870
He’s opened the third gate,
the Gate of Life…
28
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,570
He’s going to make his move!
29
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,500
No, not yet!
30
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,470
What?!
31
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,270
And also,
32
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,940
the fourth gate,
the Gate of Pain…open!
33
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
What an incredible guy…
34
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,420
It’s not as though effort alone
can make this happen…
35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,920
That boy…
36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,190
is he in fact a genius…?
37
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,710
He’s fast!
38
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,010
Gaara!
39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,710
Where are they?!
40
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
He’s above!
41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,990
But we can’t find Lee!
42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,560
Where?!
43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,730
The sand isn’t keeping up at all!
44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,470
So it’s the Sand Armor again…?
45
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,440
Then how’s this?!
46
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
What…?!
47
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,460
This Sand Armor is…
48
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,000
being peeled away…!
49
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,670
You’re a stubborn one.
50
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,900
Since it comes to this…
51
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,610
The muscles have torn…
52
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,380
Is that really Lee…?
53
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,350
When did he become like this…?
54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,550
This is the end!
55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
The Fifth Gate of Closing…open!
56
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,560
I can’t defend myself…
57
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,400
Is this the movement of
a human being?!
58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,600
Neji…
59
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,500
This technique is my ace in
the hole to take you down…
60
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,440
but I will specially show it to you!
61
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,710
Huh?!
62
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,960
The Sand Shield can’t keep up!
63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,460
Most of the armor has also
been peeled off…
64
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,730
He’s done for!
65
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,570
W-Wow!
66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,540
Hidden Lotus… In other words...
67
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,340
it’s a high-speed continuous
Taijutsu that can’t even be touched!
68
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,940
The answer to take Neji down is
that high speed combination…
69
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,510
There is no way that
the sand can keep up!
70
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,320
This technique will be the last!
71
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,590
Hidden Lotus!
72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,500
I can’t see anything, it’s too fast…
73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,650
That’s impossible…
74
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,720
The gourd has turned to sand…?
75
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,860
He’s done it this time!
76
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,100
Gaara!
77
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Lee…
78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,970
Oh!
79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,800
What’s…that?
80
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,820
He protects himself…
81
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,890
using a gourd made of sand?!
82
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,950
That technique is…!
83
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,620
Sand Coffin!
84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,470
No way!
85
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,430
He got hit by the Hidden Lotus
86
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,970
and is still able to bring
forth a technique…!
87
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,550
Sand Coffin!
88
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,230
I just can not lose in a place like this…
89
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
I want to…
90
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,870
my Way of the Ninja…
91
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,140
Oh no!
92
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,850
Die!
93
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,560
Why…?
94
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,730
Why…save him?
95
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,630
He’s…
96
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,840
I’m all right!
97
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,540
I’m strong so…
98
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,540
The Chunin Exam…
99
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,080
Guy Sensei, please watch
me with a smile...
100
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,680
I’d like to prove that I could
become a respectable Ninja
101
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,350
even though I can’t use Ninjutsu!
102
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,680
That would be the ultimate for me!
103
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,650
He is...
104
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
an important subordinate
whom I care for!
105
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,540
A subordinate…whom I care for...?
106
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,120
Those words are definitely
not understandable to Gaara…
107
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,460
I quit…
108
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,230
He quit…?
109
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,430
The moment Guy jumped in,
Lee lost.
110
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
The winner…
111
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,840
Gaa-!
112
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,070
– Wha…? 					– Huh?
113
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,980
– Huh? 					– Huh?
114
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,110
Wha--?!
115
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,760
That’s impossible…
116
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,540
Having opened the fifth gate…
117
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,980
And his hand and feet are crushed…
118
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,980
There’s no way he should
be able to stand…!
119
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,550
Lee…
120
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,550
It’s all right.
121
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,980
It’s over!
122
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,420
You’re in no condition to stand…!
123
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,560
Lee…
124
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,960
Y-You…
125
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
You are…
126
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,310
Even after having
lost consciousness…
127
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,710
You still want to prove your
own Way of the Ninja…?
128
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,750
So he had already…
129
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,220
lost consciousness…
130
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,590
Lee...
131
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,230
You’re already…
132
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,070
a respectable Ninja…!
133
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,540
The winner…
134
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,710
Gaara.
135
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,090
Lee!
136
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,100
Stop!
137
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,130
Even if you went down
what could you do?
138
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,540
Your words of encouragement
would only make him feel worse.
139
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,460
There’s no way he could
have beaten Gaara…
140
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,430
He was faced with a tougher battle
than we thought…
141
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,570
That Naruto…
142
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,650
Bushy Brow lost
to a guy like this…!
143
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,360
Medics, please hurry.
144
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,900
Bushy Brow…
145
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,300
Lee…
146
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,560
You are the Jonin in charge of him,
aren’t you?
147
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,300
Y-Yes.
148
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,570
Please come with me
for a minute.
149
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,470
Careful…
150
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,140
Don’t shake him.
151
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,760
There is faint breathing…
152
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,560
but because of comminuted fractures
and muscle tears to his entire body,
153
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,560
recovery will likely to take
quite some time…
154
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,500
If that was all, it wouldn’t be so bad, but…
155
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,450
The damage to the left arm
and leg which received the attack is severe…
156
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,410
It’s too severe…
157
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,550
Oh…!
158
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,560
I don’t want to say this,
159
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,560
but he won't be able to...
live as a Shinobi again.
160
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,010
T-That…
161
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,650
that can’t be true…
162
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,020
I will take Bushy Brow down.
Believe it!
163
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,350
It is not you whom I want to fight,
it’s Uchiha!
164
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
You…!
165
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,730
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.
166
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,670
But all fighting must be done
officially in a match!
167
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,540
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort…
168
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,540
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?
169
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,810
Though, I am probably going
to be the one fighting Neji…
170
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,550
Lee…
171
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,420
I didn’t want to think... that you’d lose.
172
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,460
I wanted to let you fulfill…
173
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,560
your Way of the Ninja!
174
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,500
Yay!
175
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
I finally mastered it!
176
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,870
Yahoo!
177
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,770
This technique…
178
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
after all, only Lee managed to master…
179
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,810
Okay, you became Genin
from today.
180
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,310
I want to hear what it is
you all are aiming for!
181
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,550
I-I’d like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja
182
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,820
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
183
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,720
That would be the ultimate for me!
184
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,860
Please forgive me for not…
185
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,930
stopping it...!
186
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,570
Lee…
187
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,970
It’s not true…it’s not true.
188
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,340
After hearing that,
what should Bushy Brow do…?!
189
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
This guy…
190
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,920
He said the failure would take
down a genius with effort…!
191
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,820
Isn’t there something that
can be done?!
192
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,920
Calm down, Naruto.
193
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,560
B-But…Kakashi Sensei!
194
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,870
He kept saying he wanted
to battle Sasuke and Neji!
195
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,070
Perhaps…that led to his ruin.
196
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,140
To fulfill that dream…
197
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,380
the boy even used a self-sacrificing
forbidden technique to try to win!
198
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,380
The result is what you see…
199
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,860
That boy…
200
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,560
Sasuke and Neji…
201
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,360
and you…
202
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,370
he sacrificed himself to
a promise he never spoke of.
203
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,300
He risked his life…
204
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,770
so that he might have
a chance to battle you guys…
205
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,810
Don't forget that…
206
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,960
I wonder if Lee…
207
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,560
will be all right…?
208
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,760
Lee…
209
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,930
You didn’t realize it even at the end…
210
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,770
Heaven does not allow it.
211
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,540
One who tries to move ahead
while achieving victory
212
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,150
through a method like dying
upon each other’s swords.
213
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,900
So it ended without incident…
214
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,530
Welcome back Gaara.
215
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,550
Guy…
216
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,960
Well…
217
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,960
I spoke self-importantly earlier but…
218
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,060
I’ve thought about it and
had I been in your position…
219
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,930
I probably... wouldn’t have
been able to stop him.
220
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,870
Guy.
221
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,810
We’re in the way of the
next tournament…let’s go up.
222
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,550
All right…
223
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,030
Then, the tenth and final round is next,
both contestants come forward!
224
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,930
So it’s finally my turn…
225
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,140
I’m gonna win and have
some barbecued beef!
226
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,510
In any case, I need to last until
the main tournament and battle Sasuke.
227
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,250
Or I will not have met your expectations,
Lord Orochimaru…
228
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,550
I can almost see through it…
229
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,560
The reason that you went to the trouble
of getting to Sasuke before us and...
230
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,790
putting a Curse Mark on him
without killing him…
231
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,100
In other words,
232
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,900
we were the guinea pigs to measure
Sasuke’s abilities during the examinations.
233
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,540
What you wanted isn’t Sasuke’s life,
but Sasuke himself…
234
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,740
I was also taken for a fool…
235
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,720
Now, let the tenth round begin.
236
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,760
Hey, can you hear it?
237
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:32,340
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
238
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:41,950
The ocean spans limitlessly
239
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:50,220
Please keep that smile on your face forever
240
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,830
Or else I’ll cry
241
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,000
You won't have to search around you
242
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,570
It’s all ok now.
243
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:13,540
Everyone is inside
this hand
244
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,980
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
245
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,550
When you forget what happiness is
246
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,360
Just sing.
247
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,600
Light is born, and darkness was born
248
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,930
The two are one
249
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
250
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,880
Hey, can you hear it?
251
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,350
Sakura!
252
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,190
Do you know where
Kakashi Sensei is?
253
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,750
Naruto...
254
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,260
I’m gonna have him watch
my training until the main tournament.
255
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,560
Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.
256
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,600
What’s up with you, Sakura?
You seem a little down.
257
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,130
No, nothing…
258
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,900
It’s just that I get this bad feeling…
259
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Next episode: “A Shadow in Darkness:
Danger Approaches Sasuke”
260
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,540
I feel uneasy for some reason…

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4

Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,730
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:44,520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,350
Fighting Dreamers

Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,770

We're gonna do it and do our best!

Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,890
I’ve done it!
The water is turning!
21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,600
It seems it’s going to be easier
than I thought to break it.
22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,150
Then I’ll go take a little rest
until it’s done…with this.
23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,650
Hey! What is that?!
24
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,850
I need it to kill the time.
And also to get some sleep.
25
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,400
Huh! The way it’s going,
it won’t even be an afternoon nap!
26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,190
Is that so…?
Call me when it is broken.
27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,770
Just wait!
28
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,650
If it keeps up like this,
I’ll learn it within today!
29
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,190
Keep on Training!
Pop Goes the Water Balloon
30
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,560
Oh man! Why doesn’t it break!
31
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,890
Huh? Are you done with it?
32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,350
Ah…well, it’s almost done
or how should I call it.
33
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,060
Oh boy…
34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,650
It seems like I went beyond
an afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.
35
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,900
Hey, hey…how do I break it?
36
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,480
Didn’t I tell you I can’t give
a detailed explanation until it’s broken?
37
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,890
All right, I understand…
38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,890
Naturally, you’re supposed to realize it
through trial and error
39
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,770
when mastering a Jutsu, but…
40
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,020
Yeah, yeah.
41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,230
I guess I’ll teach you just
a tiny bit on the Jutsu…
42
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,690
You, try rotating the water!
43
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,350
Oh, okay.
44
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,520
Right or left…which direction did you
imagine when you rotate it?
45
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,980
Hmm…well, to the left…
46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,270
Hey, come over here.
47
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Okay…
48
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,100
Huh, I thought so…
49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,400
W-What?
50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,690
You are in fact a right-rotation type.
51
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,150
Right?
52
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,020
In order to build up Chakra,
53
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,940
it is necessary to blend the energy…
54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Chakra
Spiritual energy       Physical energy
So everybody unconsciously builds up
Chakra inside the body by rotating it.
55	01:54:25:29	01:54:29:20
Right                             Left
Whether the rotation at that point
is to the right or to the left
55
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,270
differs in the individual.
56
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,890
Therefore, if you imagine
the rotation of the water balloon
57
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,150
opposite to that of your rotation-type
in this training,
58
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,560
your Chakra flow divides and resists
59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,900
and the momentum of
the rotation does not get on track.
60
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,400
You should be able to figure
that kind of stuff on your own.
61
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,230
But how did you figure out that
I’m a right-type so fast?
62
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,890
The cowlick on your head!
63
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,890
It's pretty much determined that you’re
a right type if a whorl rolls to the right
64
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,690
and you’re a left-type
if it rolls to the left.
65
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,310
It’s simple.
66
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,890
Huh, so I have a right roll!
67
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,810
Yes, so if you want to rotate it,
you have to imagine a right rotation.
68
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,890
I never really paid attention
that until now…
69
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,230
But this Jutsu is just the one for you.
70
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,440
Hand sign is completely unnecessary.
All you need is Chakra.
71
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,730
There is no need to learn
a finicky hand sign!
72
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,770
It’s okay to be stupid!
73
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,890
I’m not stupid!
74
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,770
I’m the man who’s eventually going
to become a Hokage!
75
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,100
It’s easy once you understand!
76
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,890
This Jutsu, I’ll completely master it
if I got three days!
77
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,100
Three days, huh?
78
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,980
This Jutsu is a Ninjutsu
that the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.
79
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,270
Huh…?
80
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,770
It took him three whole years
to perfect this Jutsu…
81
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,650
This Jutsu is second from the top
82
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,980
on the six degrees of
difficulty in mastering…
83
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,310
It’s an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.
84
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,060
In order to learn this move,
there are three steps in the training.
85
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,810
This “Water Balloon Breaking”
is the first step.
86
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,150
It took the genius Ninja,
the Fourth Hokage…
87
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,690
Three years…
88
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,560
There’s no point in explaining
anymore to someone
89
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,350
who can’t even clear the first step.
90
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,810
Do the rest by yourself!
91
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Take care!
I’m going to return to the town.
92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,600
I have to gather some information…
93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,940
What will you do?
94
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,850
A-rank in degree of difficulty
in mastering…
95
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,810
The Ninjutsu left behind
by the Fourth Hokage…
96
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,440
I’m not gonna go back yet!
97
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,890
Huh…
98
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,890
So long… Don’t go overboard with it.
99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,940
Now, what will happen?
100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,520
It’s something to be concerned about…
101
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,890
Mister!
102
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,150
Why don’t you stop by?
103
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,600
This month is our special service month.
104
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,560
Whoa! It’s a special service month?
105
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
The more you visit,
the more you benefit.
106
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,690
Here you go, a stamp card!
107
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,770
I’ll give you lots and lots of service!
108
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,400
I’ll come, I’ll come!
109
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,890
Hey! Come on down, Shu!
110
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,890
Hey, hey, where is the toilet?
111
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,730
I don’t have time to spend three years.
112
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,890
All right now!
113
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,270
Training, once again today!
I’m gonna work hard like a blaze!
114
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,400
Break! Break! Break!
115
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,890
Why won’t it break?
116
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,890
Little Jiraiya, you’re so naughty!
117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,270
Men are all naughty!
118
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,810
Dang it!
119
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Three days have passed since
I got the tip from that Pervy Sage…
120
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,100
The rubber is stretched this much,
but why won’t it break?
121
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,810
What am I doing different from
that Pervy Sage?
122
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,890
This is great! This is so great!
123
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
What the--?
124
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,060
Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.
125
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,350
I’m gonna eat now!
126
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,690
Huh?
127
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,890
What's the matter?
128
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,890
Oh dang it!
129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,890
Darn it! Why is it like this?!
130
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,060
No need to learn a finicky hand sign!
lt’s okay to be stupid!
131
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,400
He said that there’s no need to form
a hand signal, but…
132
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,890
Hey! That’s not your toy…
133
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
This is it!
134
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,310
Hurry up and wake up!
Hey, you Pervy Sage!
135
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,890
Uh… G-Good timing.
136
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,310
Why don’t you bring me some water…
137
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,560
Water?
138
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,230
The first step is cleared!
139
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,100
Cleared…?
140
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,150
Well, let’s have you show it to me.
141
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,900
All right! Watch it carefully!
142
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,020
Left hand?
143
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,980
Go!
144
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,520
All right! See that?! See that?!
145
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,440
You’re sleeping!
146
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,270
Sorry, sorry.
147
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,890
I’m tired from the days and nights
of gathering information.
148
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,810
But that seems suspicious to begin with!
149
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,440
You still stink of alcohol too!
150
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,310
Nevertheless…
151
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,890
You rotate the water inside the water balloon
that you hold in your left hand
152
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,310
by repeatedly applying it
with your right hand…
153
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,900
It seems little strange of an idea, but…
154
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,890
You’re an interesting kid.
155
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,900
You understood the trick pretty well.
lt’s all thanks to me, though.
156
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,440
It’s thanks to this guy!
157
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,730
Huh?
158
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,440
I realized after I saw this cat playing
with the water balloon.
159
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,600
He kept on flicking it with
his paw many times
160
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,230
and the water inside shocked
in all different kinds of direction…
161
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Then it came to me like “bingo!”
162
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,600
How did it come like “bingo”?
163
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,020
The time when the Pervy Sage
first showed me breaking it…
164
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,310
I remembered how the water balloon
surface was not smooth.
165
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,890
Until then,
I was always only rotating the water
166
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,890
in the one same direction…
167
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,520
I realized that the Pervy Sage’s
water balloon was not smooth
168
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,890
because the water inside was rotating
in different directions.
169
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,730
And after doing it in my own way,
it broke!
170
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,890
It seems it’s still not possible for you
171
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,560
to rotate it violently with one hand, but…
172
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,890
I suppose you thought it out
in your own way.
173
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,890
That’s just what he expected of me!
174
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,190
Anyhow…
The first step is complete for now.
175
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,890
All right!
176
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,890
Do you want to see it one more time?
One more time!
177
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,890
Oww!
178
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,890
You used too much Chakra and
it gradually reached the point
179
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,890
where there’s burden
on the Chakra Network…
180
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,900
But the next one won’t be like this!
181
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,310
Okay. Now, we will proceed
to the second step.
182
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,520
Yeah!
183
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,890
It seems like we can finally go
into some serious training!
184
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,150
– Here you go! 					– Huh?
185
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,020
Rubber ball?
Something like this again?!
186
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,600
Now, you’ll break this one!
187
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,350
It’s one hundred times harder
than the water balloon!
188
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,060
It’s hard…
189
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,980
The first step is rotation,
the second step is force.
190
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,310
Since there is no water inside,
191
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,980
it’s more difficult to imagine
the rotation of Chakra,
192
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,270
so it becomes more difficult
to rotate the Chakra as well.
193
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,060
That’s true…
194
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,600
I’ll leave that to your own judgment.
195
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,690
I need to learn a trick again
to do this, don’t I?
196
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,890
Well then,
I’ll go gather some information.
197
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,810
Hey! Wait, wait!
198
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,230
Let’s train together for
the first time in a while!
199
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,020
I don’t mind if you take a nap.
200
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,560
Don’t depend on me!
201
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,480
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!
202
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,150
I did say that I’ll teach you the Jutsu,
203
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,650
but I don’t have the obligation
to teach you every step of the way.
204
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,900
If you can’t do it by yourself,
then that’s it.
205
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,440
Don’t be childish forever…
Become more respectable like a Shinobi!
206
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,810
Well, well then.
207
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,270
If you can at least teach me…
the trick again…
208
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,690
Money!
209
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,770
Money…money…money…
210
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,440
W-What do you mean
“be respectable like a Shinobi”?!
211
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,100
Even though you say that,
you’re an dirty and greedy adult!
212
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,770
You’re not a respectable Shinobi at all!
213
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,890
It’s way more difficult than
the time with the water balloon…
214
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,890
A-And…
215
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,770
my hands and arms hurt.
216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,270
Dang it! How many days am I
going to be doing the same thing!
217
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,100
Second from the top in
the difficulty of mastering…
218
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,150
Don’t depend on me!
219
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,890
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!
220
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,520
Dang it!
221
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,560
Hey, Naruto.
222
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,890
What did you come here for?
223
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,480
Go buy some food from the town below.
224
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,890
What?! Why me?
225
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,980
Hey you…
226
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,270
Even if for a while, you’re still
learning the Jutsu from me.
227
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,890
Here you go, thanks for waiting.
228
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,400
Thank you.
229
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,400
How dare he put on a master’s face
only at a time like this
230
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,890
when he doesn’t teach me anything…
231
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,690
Dad, buy me some ice cream.
232
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,810
I want this one that cracks.
233
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,980
Here.
234
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,690
Why? I can eat all of it by myself.
235
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,890
Nope, when you get home,
your mother will have supper ready.
236
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,890
Okay!
237
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,480
Hey…you know…
238
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,400
Huh?
239
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,310
Can you be around my training
for just a while…today?
240
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,770
I don’t have time for that.
241
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,770
I have to immediately go to town.
242
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,600
Unless you think for yourself and
get a grip of the trick for yourself,
243
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,350
it’ll never work.
244
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,940
I thought I told you three weeks ago!
245
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,890
Don’t be spoiled like a kid.
You are a Ninja.
246
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,270
I know that without
your telling me!
247
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,100
Just thought I'd ask.
248
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,980
Hurry up and go,
you Pervy Sage!
249
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,350
Oh no, little Jiraiya,
you tell so many lies!
250
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,850
What do you mean?!
Everything is true!
251
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,890
Dang it! It doesn’t break
no matter how much I try…
252
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,560
I’m just dripping away
my Chakra this way.
253
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,770
Also…
254
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,440
The more I increase the amount of flow,
the worse the pain gets.
255
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,890
But… How do I say it?
256
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,520
If I don’t go all out as if
to explode the Chakra,
257
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,100
it’s not going to break!
258
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,020
That’s it!
259
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,650
If I understand the amount of Chakra
that flows from the pain I feel…
260
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,890
Then I can bear the pain to the limit
and all at once…
261
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,770
No, not yet…
262
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,060
Not yet!
263
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,100
Not yet…store it!
264
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,890
Now!
265
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,480
Oww!
266
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,560
Hmm… There seems to have been
a little progress.
267
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,350
Humph!
268
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,310
I’ve still only opened a hole
and it hasn’t popped with a bang!
269
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,890
Hey, don’t pretend to be so tough. Here!
270
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,890
You’ve done well,
all on your own power.
271
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,520
It’s so good!
272
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Yes…
273
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,690
Oh yeah. Maybe we’ll test a bit.
274
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,890
What, what?
275
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,850
Give me your right hand.
276
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,980
What’s this?
277
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,060
A cycle of hardship, right?
278
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,020
Inside, we were crying, right?
279
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:41,350
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
280
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,440
It's a secondary role,
281
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,190
a role in the shadows
282
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,650
But in reaching for that dream,
283
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,230
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
284
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,310
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
285
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,270
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
286
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:20,560
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
287
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,890
Over and over,
we've seen fools
288
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,650
He tells me
"focus, focus, focus!"
289
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,690
But I've never been good at it, ever.
290
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,230
Speaking of concentration,
291
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,310
Iruka Sensei used to scold me often
at the Ninja Academy
292
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,940
for my lack of concentration.
293
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,940
Oh…I would've listened to him better
if I knew this would happen.
294
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,230
Next time: "Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf"
//%

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,350
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,890
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,480
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,060
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,480
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,480
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,150
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,980
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,270
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,650
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,940
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,520
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,600
Fighting Dreamers

Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,890
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,520
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,940

Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,310
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,890
How is that your answer…
Princess Tsunade?
21
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,690
To think you’d try to kill me…
22
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,890
At any rate,
I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.
23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,890
A trust for your loyalty and your eyes
that spotted Tsunade’s attack.
24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,190
Yes. We’re both from
the same medical corps so…
25
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,890
Her Chakra was overflowing
with violent intent.
26
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,400
Tsunade… I was really planning
on resurrecting those two people.
27
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,980
And here I went so far as to promise
not to smash the Leaf Village…
28
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,890
Orochimaru…
29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,690
I know that your promise of
”not touching the village” was a lie…
30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,940
Even though I knew that…I…
31
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,270
Just one more time
would’ve been fine…
32
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,900
Just one more time,
I wanted to see them…
33
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,270
Just one more time…
I wanted to touch them…
34
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,810
Just one more time…
To see those smiling faces…
35
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,060
But…
36
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,230
the moment I felt that
rush in my bones…
37
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,730
that I’d be able to see Nawaki
and Dan shortly…
38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,810
I realized that I’m a hopeless fool!
39
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,560
Just by remembering those faces…
40
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,230
I become this blinded.
41
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,810
Big sister!
42
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,730
Tsunade…
43
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,770
I loved them…
I truly loved them!
44
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,150
So, I wanted to see them
and hug them in my arms!
45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,400
But…I couldn’t…
46
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,100
I won’t lose the bet,
no matter what!
47
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,890
Because of that kid…
I remembered the dreams of the two.
48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,940
Here I was trying to forget…
49
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,650
This village is grandfather’s treasure!
50
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,650
I’m going to protect it!
51
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,560
'Cuz I’m the grandson
of the First Hokage
52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,890
who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!
53
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,850
I love this village and my comrades…
54
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,690
So I want to protect them.
55
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,890
Right! Someday,
I’ll become just like Grandfather.
56
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,270
And the Hokage name will be mine!
57
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:03,600
Unlike you… I will be the heir to
the Hokage name, no matter what!
58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,480
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.
59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,190
So I’ll become the Hokage…
60
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,850
An existence that protects everyone…
61
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,810
– Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
– Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
62
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,600
The precious dreams that
they risked their lives for…
63
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,730
Making those dreams come true
was also my desire…
64
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,310
Things that have formed
eventually decay… You said that.
65
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,770
But…
66
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,730
after all, these are feelings
that won’t decay…
67
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,940
So our negotiations have broken down…
lt can’t be helped.
68
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,230
Since it’s come to this, I have no choice
but to ask forcibly.
69
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,940
Breakdown! The Deal is Off!
70
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,480
Come! Orochimaru!
71
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,890
Come to think of it,
72
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,440
we’ve never gone at it
even once until now.
73
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,690
That’s right!
74
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,890
What’re you saying?
75
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,810
I’m the one who has
to go at it with her, right?
76
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,890
Now I’m going to kill
you two worthless punks…here!
77
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,810
Incredible strength as usual…
78
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,020
It’ll be over if you’re hit once.
79
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,060
I can see that…
80
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,690
It’s a bit cramped here
for fighting at a distance.
81
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,230
Are you going to change the location?
82
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,150
That would probably be better…
83
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,520
There was another troublesome person
with the Lady Tsunade’s attendant.
84
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,480
That person may come
to her aid.
85
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,100
You’re going down!
86
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,020
Who is…the troublesome person?
87
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,560
One of Sannin,
the same as you and Lady Tsunade…
88
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,400
Jiraiya!
89
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,480
I won’t let you get away,
no matter what!
90
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,890
Wh-What’s this?!
91
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:12,730
Huh… Princess Tsunade tore it up…
big time.
92
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,890
This means that Lady Tsunade refused…
93
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,400
Where did old Tsunade go?
94
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,850
That belongs to Lady Tsunade…!
95
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,650
Tonton… Which way?
96
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,810
Okay!
97
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,850
It looks like you’re quite
out of breath, too… Tsunade.
98
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,310
It’s just about time.
99
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,900
I’m not that great at Taijutsu, but…
100
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,730
A Food Pill!
101
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,400
That Sign…!
102
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,890
This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu…
103
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,890
He got my muscle…!
104
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,890
I severed, ever so slightly,
105
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,940
the bicep muscle of your upper arm
and the rectus muscle of your thigh.
106
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,190
Now you won’t be able to release
your incredible strength.
107
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,890
A Chakra scalpel, eh…
Why don’t you target the arteries?
108
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,560
Indeed, with this scalpel,
109
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,890
I could cut the muscles and vessels
without external injury.
110
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,060
But as may be expected,
111
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,060
I can’t make a long, delicate scalpel
in the middle of battle
112
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,890
that can reach the arteries
and the heart muscle.
113
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,890
But, even so…
114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,730
there’d be no problem at all
if I target the opponent’s neck!
115
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,600
Dang it! My intercostals got hit.
My breathing…
116
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,980
He’s no ordinary Medical Ninja.
117
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,890
His Jutsu sense and his edge
exceed even me in my heyday!
118
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,890
It would still be trouble
if you were to die on me.
119
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,900
I won’t target your vital spot…
120
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,890
But with this, you can’t move anymore…
121
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,270
She’s amazing…
122
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,350
Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be able
to budge due to difficulty breathing.
123
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,810
It looks like it will be necessary
to rough her up a little more…
124
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,810
but not enough to kill her.
125
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,480
Even though I’m trying to move my hand…
126
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,890
my leg moves?!
127
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,560
D-Don’t tell me! This is…
128
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,890
You little!
129
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,730
In my present condition,
130
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,890
this seems to be the extent of my power…
131
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,980
I see…
132
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,890
It’s… It’s not the muscles…
lt’s the nerves!
133
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,270
It seems you’ve realized…
That’s right. It’s the nerves!
134
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,890
I changed Chakra into electricity…
135
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,890
made an electrical field and
poured electricity into your nerves.
136
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,100
The communication between
the brain and the body
137
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,150
is all done with electric signals…
138
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,850
Tsunade jumbled up all of
the electric signals that are exchanged
139
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,810
at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.
140
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,810
Having left battle and yet such power…
141
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,020
So this is the legendary Sannin?
142
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,730
Healing-types use too much Chakra…
143
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
But in this condition…
144
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,890
If I try to move my right hand…
145
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,060
my left leg moves.
146
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,810
If I try to move my left ankle…
147
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,270
my right shoulder moves.
148
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,230
It’s difficult…
149
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,230
But I’ve already grasped eighty percent
of what moves when I move what.
150
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,850
Don’t mess with me…
151
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,600
with this low-level…
152
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,350
Jutsu!
153
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,890
What?! In only a moment,
his body movements…
154
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,890
You’re scared of blood, aren’t you?!
155
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,270
I’ll show you plenty from now!
156
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,890
Jiraiya…?
157
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,890
It’s been a long time… Jiraiya.
158
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,060
Orochimaru…
159
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,890
You’ve got an evil look as usual.
160
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,100
Huh?!
161
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,890
K-Kabuto?
162
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,890
Naruto…
163
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,270
I see… So you know each other?
164
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,890
We took the Chunin Exam together!
165
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,150
Why are you here, Kabuto…?
166
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,060
Get out of the way!
167
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,020
Hey…
168
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,400
I’ll take…
169
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,890
these guys!
170
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,890
Just because you’ve mastered
your body movements…
171
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,350
it doesn’t mean…
172
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,400
you can move like normal!
173
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,890
I won’t let you get away now!
174
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,890
Too late!
175
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,980
My body movements have
finally returned…
176
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,060
Blood…!
177
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,810
Having two of the legendary Sannin
as opponents is hairy, isn’t it…?
178
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,890
So even if it's just one…
I'll stop you!
179
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,980
Lady Tsunade!
180
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,980
Say! Say! What’s happening?!
181
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,890
Why’s Kabuto fighting
with old Tsunade?!
182
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,560
You’re slow, Naruto…
183
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,900
That’s why you’re no match for Sasuke.
184
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,600
Take a good look at the headband!
185
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,940
He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
186
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,440
Wha--?!
187
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,310
That’s right…
188
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,230
I was a spy from
the Village Hidden in the Sound.
189
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,980
Wh-What’re you saying?
190
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,850
You’re lying, right, Kabuto?
191
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,350
During the Chunin Exam
you taught us a lot…
192
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,890
And you also saved us.
193
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,690
Well, I wanted to gather data
on you guys.
194
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,900
Naruto, there’s something
I understood by gathering your data.
195
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,690
You have no Ninja ability.
196
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,650
Unlike Sasuke!
197
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,770
It’s the first time
I’ve seen Lady Tsunade like this…
198
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,890
Please don’t push it too far alone.
199
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,980
I’m your attendant, so…
200
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,150
Old Lady Tsunade…
201
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Even with a fierce look,
202
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,890
you’re just a cute Genin
who’s a fish out of water.
203
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,440
Admittedly, I was anticipating
the monster dwelling inside you…
204
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,690
But now,
with the legendary Sannin before me,
205
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,560
you leave something to be desired.
206
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,020
You’re just a puny zero.
So if you meddle…
207
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,890
I’ll kill you.
208
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,150
You little!
209
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,850
Don’t, Naruto!
210
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,310
My body’s still…
211
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,890
That hand…
212
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,810
He shouldn’t be able to use
that right hand anymore.
213
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,100
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
214
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,230
I’ll attack at once with four…
215
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,440
and break him from the right side
where he can’t defend!
216
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,060
You little!
217
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,350
Okay!
218
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,690
What?
219
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,230
Blood?
220
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,890
Poison Needles!
221
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,940
My neural reflexes still haven’t
completely returned!
222
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,230
I can’t dodge completely!
223
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,520
With the headband…!
224
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,560
Good job, acting so quickly…
225
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,150
Thanks, Shizune!
226
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,890
That’s…
227
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,890
A Plasma Pill!
228
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,890
A Plasma Pill?
229
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,440
So he’s trying to replenish
lost blood, huh…
230
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,940
That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me…
231
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,230
The blood is gushing out nicely,
eh, Kabuto?
232
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,890
Lord Orochimaru…
233
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,150
Please take off the bandage
on your left arm.
234
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,100
That man is Orochimaru…
235
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,270
At last, the real thing appears…
236
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Shizune!
237
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,980
Y-Yes!
238
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,230
You take care of…
that guy with the glasses!
239
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,060
I’ll take care of Orochimaru!
240
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,850
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
241
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,100
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
242
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,270
On your still shoulder
243
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,900
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
244
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,650
The city lights are like pieces of stars
245
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,400
That hold us together
246
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:58,020
“Each one of us glows differently,”
247
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,850
you say laughingly
248
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,810
but you look most dazzling
249
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,730
Like a comet,
250
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,890
like the rainbow after the storm
251
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,900
You bring light into my heart
252
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:35,350
Being lost can be the answer
253
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:44,190
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
254
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,270
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
255
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,940
Enough already, you traitor!
256
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,270
Don't you dare touch
Old Lady Tsunade again!
257
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,850
Hey Old Lady,
just like our wager
258
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,400
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you!
259
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,980
I won't run away!
I won't give up!
260
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,060
Just watch.
This is my Way of Ninja!
261
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,100
Next time:
"Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!"
//%
1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,010
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,470
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,680
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,180
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,100
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,430
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,930
Huh, it’s Lady Tsunade.
21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,430
Huh? You guys are…
22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,760
Hey, are you visiting someone
at the hospital too?
23
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,010
Yes.
24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,260
You too, Lady Tsunade?
25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,590
Well, I guess…
26
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,350
She just doesn’t want to stay
in the executive office…
27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,300
Shut up!
28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,590
Hinata, don’t faint when
you see Kurenai Sensei.
29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,760
P-Please let's not talk about that.
30
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,390
Did something happen?
31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,590
When we were visiting Naruto
in the hospital in the past…
32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,590
Shino!
33
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,180
This girl fainted when she saw Naruto
all covered with bandages.
34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,140
Kiba!
35
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,680
I’ll…I’ll be fine this time!
36
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,220
I finally found you…!
37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,970
Old Lady Tsunade, I need
to talk to you!
38
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,430
Huh? Hinata!
39
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,930
Naruto…
40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,970
– Naruto is…so close!
– Hinata? Hinata! What's wrong?
41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,800
Your face looks a little red…
42
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,930
Do you have a fever or something? Huh?
43
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,760
Hey…
44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,760
H-Hey, Hinata…?!
45
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,470
Hey Hinata!
46
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,100
Are you okay?!
Get a hold of yourself!
47
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,930
Hinata!
48
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,010
Naruto…
49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,640
The Search for
the Rare Bikochu Beetle
50
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,970
Hey, you woke up.
51
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,300
So Mizuki didn’t know anything,
you said?
52
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,180
Tsunade interrogated him herself.
53
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,800
He didn’t have any information
54
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,470
that would lead to Orochimaru’s
current whereabouts…
55
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,180
After all, that guy was nothing but
a disposable pawn to Orochimaru, huh.
56
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,260
So it seems…
57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,800
We still don’t know where
Sasuke went…
58
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,600
And that’s the result after
a desperate fight with Mizuki…
59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,890
That can’t sit right with
Naruto either…huh?
60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,720
Please Old Lady Tsunade,
say it’s okay!
61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,140
When I say no, I mean no!
62
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,220
As a result, Lady Tsunade wasn’t able
to concentrate on her work.
63
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,970
Naruto’s been breathing down
her neck the whole time
64
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,350
asking her to let him go off
in search of Sasuke.
65
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,350
So she sneaked out
of her office, but…
66
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,590
He was lying in wait for her here.
67
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,970
Naruto…
68
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,680
I’ve asked you numerous times already!
69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,260
Please let me go in search
of Sasuke!
70
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,640
I’ve told you numerous times already.
lmpossible!
71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,390
Why!
72
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,550
You have some training to do!
73
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,100
I can’t because Pervy Sage
isn’t around!
74
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,050
We have zero leads on either
Orochimaru and Sasuke.
75
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,590
So how are you planning
to search for him?
76
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,720
I can figure it out somehow!
77
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,510
If there aren’t any leads,
I’ll go find some!
78
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,590
So please let me go do it!
79
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,590
You’re stubborn, aren't you?
80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,350
You’re stubborn too,
Old Lady Tsunade!
81
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,260
– Please let me go!
– No, you may not!
82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,640
If I say I’m going, I’m going!
83
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,590
Shut up! No means no!
84
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,050
Byakugan!
85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,050
All right! Good work, Neji!
86
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,590
Move in another half step
right there!
87
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,300
Yes sir!
88
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,350
Sorry to keep you waiting.
89
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,590
Let’s take a break, Neji.
90
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,970
Yes.
91
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,970
Have some tea too.
92
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,590
Thank you…
93
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,930
If Hinata was here,
she should have observed a little.
94
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,350
Hinata prepared this…?
95
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,260
It would supplement her training
by observing…
96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Byakugan!
97
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,390
Let’s take a break.
98
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,550
Yes.
99
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,590
Food! Food!
100
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,260
That was pretty well done.
101
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,590
I would say that you’re getting closer
to perfecting the technique.
102
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,590
It’s thanks to you both.
103
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,760
You’re so kind to join me
in my special training every day…
104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,590
We’re a team.
105
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,600
When a comrade in the team
is in a fix,
106
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,010
one offers a helping hand.
107
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,760
That’s only natural…
108
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,590
A comrade…
109
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,050
If a comrade suddenly disappears,
110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,720
it must be awfully hard.
111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,720
You’re talking about Naruto,
aren’t you?
112
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,850
Isn't there some way
we could help him?
113
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,350
I’d like to help him out in
some way too…but…
114
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,050
Lady Hokage was telling Naruto…
115
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,180
that there are no leads at all.
116
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,390
There may be one resource…
117
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,590
Really?!
118
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,390
I’m talking about Bikochu.
119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,970
Bikochu?
120
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,510
Are you talking about
those rare insects…?!
121
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,100
I have heard that they had
become extinct some time ago.
122
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,600
Since there was a possibility
that they could become extinct,
123
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,800
the Aburame Clan discontinued
using them,
124
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,590
so a miniscule number of them
should still be alive.
125
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,220
Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu?
126
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,470
Well…it’s not surprising that
you don’t know about them.
127
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,180
The last time that Bikochu
were used
128
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,590
was before the last Great War…
129
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,350
Bikochu are one kind of insect
used by insect handlers.
130
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,590
Larvae which have hatched from eggs
become chrysalises in no time at all,
131
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,590
then emerge and turn
into imagos.
132
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
They are then made to
recognize scents…
133
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,010
and they are able to track
even the faintest scent…
134
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,590
to its source.
135
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,590
Their olfactory sense is several thousand
times greater than a Ninja Hound's.
136
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,930
They are insects capable of
exhibiting that skill in an exceptional way.
137
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,470
However, Bikochu lay eggs
only once every several years…
138
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,760
This year is actually the year
in which they lay eggs.
139
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,590
And right now is exactly
the time when they hatch.
140
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
I see.
141
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,350
There are still some of
Sasuke’s belongings left in the village…
142
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,470
Right?
143
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,100
If one makes the Bikochu,
recognize that scent…
144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,140
We may be able to locate
Sasuke’s whereabouts, right?
145
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,590
What is the probability
of finding a Bikochu?
146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,640
Frankly speaking, not very high.
Perhaps 10%.
147
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,300
10% huh…
148
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,720
As you guys know,
149
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,680
the situation in the village
is currently very grave…
150
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,590
We don’t have the leeway of allowing
even Genin to sit around and play.
151
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,640
However, fortunately or unfortunately,
Kurenai has been hospitalized,
152
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,430
so you guys, Squad Eight,
no longer have a mission.
153
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,590
Rather than just letting
you sit around and play,
154
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,800
I’d rather place my bet
on that 10% possibility.
155
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,220
Huh… you mean…
156
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,590
Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka.
Hinata Hyuga.
157
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,390
I order you to search for
the Bikochu!
158
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,590
– All right! 					– All right!
159
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,050
I designate Shino
as the leader this time.
160
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,430
And…that spy up there!
161
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,390
Oww…!
162
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,640
Naruto…
163
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,470
You’re going to go even if
I try to stop you, right?
164
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,590
Yup!
165
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
In that case, I have no choice
but to let you go…
166
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,430
However…
167
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,180
This is your last chance.
168
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,800
If you don’t find the Bikochu…
169
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,260
you must give up on Sasuke!
170
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,350
Wha--?
171
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,220
You understand?!
172
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,800
It’ll be fine…
I’ll find it without fail.
173
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,680
All right. You won’t go back
on your word, right?
174
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,510
Yeah! Leave it to me!
175
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,140
You’re easily pleased, aren’t you?
176
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,930
Owww!
177
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,050
Naruto…
178
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,600
Sasuke…
179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,590
Hinata.
180
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,970
Good morning.
181
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Neji will be here soon
for his training…
182
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,180
Please prepare tea as always.
183
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,470
Well…
184
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,010
Huh? What’s the matter?
185
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,600
I need to go…
on a mission starting now…
186
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,100
A mission, huh…
187
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,760
In that case, it can’t be helped…
188
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,390
I’m heading out…
189
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,470
Don’t be a burden to the others.
190
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,590
Yes, sir!
191
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,760
I’m…I’m sorry! I’m in a hurry…
192
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
The way she handled
her physical response just now…
193
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,890
Hinata…
194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,800
You’re late, Hinata!
195
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,350
I’m sorry!
196
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,390
All right then! Let’s head out!
197
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,300
Let’s go!
198
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,350
Huh?
199
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,550
Why are you walking at
such a leisurely pace?!
200
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,720
It takes a Shinobi two days on foot
201
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
to get to the habitat of
the Bikochu …
202
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,850
There’s no need to make haste
from the very start.
203
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,260
But what if the eggs hatch
before we get there?
204
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,430
The eggs of Bikochu only hatch
on the day after it’s rained…
205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,590
There’s no sign of it
raining any time soon…
206
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,590
But…if by some remote chance…
207
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,350
Naruto.
208
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,550
Wh-What is it?
209
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,680
I am the leader of this team.
210
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,100
While we are on this mission,
you will obey the orders of your leader.
211
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,720
Kiba, I can’t believe you’re able
to work with that kind of guy…
212
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,600
Well, I’ve gotten used to it…
213
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,510
I’m sure you’ll bond with him too, Naruto.
214
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,600
I wonder about that…
215
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,930
Naruto and the others
left a while ago.
216
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,590
I see.
217
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,220
Didn’t you want to go too?
218
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,590
When it comes to searching
for insects,
219
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,590
Shino, who’s an insect handler,
is number one…
220
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,760
And then Hinata who has Byakugan…
221
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,930
and Kiba and Akamaru who have
sensitive noses are there too…
222
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,140
So there’s really no role that
I could play!
223
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,180
What I must do right now…
224
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,550
is to become a Medical Ninja
as soon as I possibly can!
225
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,510
What’s the matter, Shino?!
226
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,350
The sun’s going down.
We’re setting up camp.
227
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,100
Got it.
228
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,010
– Huh? 					– Okay.
229
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,800
Huh? What…?!
230
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,760
We’re gonna set up
camp already?!
231
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,470
I’m not tired at all yet!
Let’s go further!
232
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,010
Naruto, the leader of
this team is me.
233
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,430
I-I understand!
234
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,720
Okay then…let’s sleep.
235
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,640
Huh…we’re gonna sleep already?!
236
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,260
Many animals and plants
go to sleep at sunset
237
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,600
and awake at sunrise.
238
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,760
In order to search for insects,
239
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,470
we must understand the rhythm
of living creatures with our own bodies…
240
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,180
But…the sun’s just set…
241
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,390
Naruto, I am the leader of this team…
242
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,180
Okay, okay. I got it!
243
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,470
There’s no way
I can sleep so early…
244
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,590
Yeah, right…
245
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,100
All that complaining and guess
who's the first one to fall asleep?
246
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,590
I have to pee…
247
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,590
Huh?
248
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,640
Huh?
249
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,430
What’s that?
250
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,550
It’s a waterfall…
251
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,590
Hey… Is somebody there?
252
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,590
S-Say…
253
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,590
Damn it…!
254
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,010
S-Sorry. Did I scare you?
255
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,220
Huh?
256
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,100
There’s nobody there…
257
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,590
Huh, Naruto…
Did you catch a cold?
258
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,010
Yeah…a little…
259
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,680
After sleeping so much
you’re still tired?
260
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,550
Well, uh…
261
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,590
When I woke up last night to pee,
I saw something awesome…
262
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,970
Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?
263
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,300
No, I’m okay…
264
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,590
And…what was that awesome thing?
265
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
It was a beautiful woman
in the middle of the waterfall!
266
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,590
Huh?
267
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,850
When that person moved her arms,
the water would suddenly move too!
268
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,590
It was awesome!
269
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,010
And what happened then…
270
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,590
When I tried to speak to her,
she suddenly vanished.
271
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,590
You must have been dreaming
or something.
272
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,800
It's starting to feel that way…
273
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,390
You idiot!
274
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,890
Your face is red, Hinata.
275
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,720
You might have really
caught a cold.
276
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,260
Huh…really, I’m fine…
277
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,590
This fruit is edible.
This will be our meal today.
278
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,220
Got it.
279
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,550
We can save on
our food supplies too.
280
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,590
There’s one thing
I need to warn you about.
281
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,470
On rare occasions, this fruit grows
to the size of a human being.
282
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,390
However, those fruits
are damaged inside.
283
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,010
Don’t tamper with them
under any circumstance.
284
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,590
There’s nobody who would
eat something that huge.
285
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,140
N-Naruto…!
286
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,050
He’s eating it…
287
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,680
Naruto… We’re going on ahead…
288
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,550
I’ll…I’ll be right behind you!
289
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,890
Sorry to keep you waiting!
290
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,600
Wait just a second!
291
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,930
Hey…aren’t we there yet?
292
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,640
Yes.
293
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,600
We're here!
294
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,590
What…?
295
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,590
Wow!
296
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,590
I’ve never seen anything
like this before.
297
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,010
This certainly isn’t a place
where humans could inhabit.
298
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,590
That’s right…
That’s why it’s paradise for insects.
299
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,590
D-Don’t tell me…
300
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Could it be that…over there…?
301
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,260
You mean that’s where
the Bikochu are?
302
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,590
No problem.
lt’s better than the Chunin Exam.
303
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,850
Damn…The foothold crumbles easily…
304
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,430
– Naruto… 					– What?
305
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,640
As the leader, I’m warning you…
306
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,850
At a time like this,
what is it?!
307
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,470
Don’t fall.
308
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,220
I already know that
without your telling me!
309
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,930
Naruto!
310
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,350
No way…!
311
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,010
That was close…
312
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,590
Those were insects, huh…
313
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,590
That’s why I warned you.
314
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,890
When this mission is over,
315
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,510
I’m definitely gonna kick
that guy’s butt!
316
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,850
This is…the Bikochu forest.
317
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,220
Let’s go.
318
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,590
There’s no mistake.
Those are Leaf Shinobi.
319
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,140
The fact that those guys came to
a place like this
320
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,970
means their objective is…
321
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,140
Yeah…it’s the same as ours…
the Bikochu.
322
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,550
We’re not gonna let them
take any Bikochu.
323
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,590
The Bikochu, …
belong to us, the Kamizuru Clan!
324
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,640
Crappy news pass us by
325
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,220
And you become speechless
326
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,220
My voice is way too soft
327
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,510
So you don’t answer
328
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,140
You’re crying   Crying alone
329
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,970
What can I do?   I’m crying too
330
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,590
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
331
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:07,680
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
332
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:17,430
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
333
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:26,590
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
334
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:38,390
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
335
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,350
Huh! If you’re talking about
the insect in this photograph,
336
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,590
I’m very familiar with it.
337
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,850
– Huh? 					– Really?!
338
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,470
Damn…Don’t tell me
that was a Bikochu?
339
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,220
Where did you see it?
340
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,640
I heard some rustling in the kitchen
in the middle of the night,
341
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,760
and I unintentionally threw
a slipper at it…
342
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,590
Wait a second…
343
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,010
N-Naruto…
344
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,760
What you’re talking about
is an ordinary cockroach.
345
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,550

Don’t All Insects Look Alike?”

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,930
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,550
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,140
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,550
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,550
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,220
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,050
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:44,350
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,720
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,010
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,180

Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,600
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,840
A hot spring?
21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,220
Yeah, just off of this road
there’s a nice town with a hot spring.
22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,390
Yunosato Hot Springs…
23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,100
They say it does a world of good
for fatigue and beauty.
24
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,300
Aren’t we going straight home?
Everyone’s waiting!
25
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,840
Naruto’s right.
26
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,930
Our hometown is in
a state of emergency,
27
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,550
there’s no time to procrastinate.
28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,850
It won't make much difference
if we’re one or two days late…
29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,600
It’s really popular with girls,
and it’s mixed bathing…
30
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,550
Hey?! Pervy Sage?
31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Sometimes it’s necessary for humans
to take breathers.
32
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,390
We’ll take one bath!
33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,970
That’s not what you said before!
34
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,840
It’s okay. Well, let’s go!
35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,640
That’s her, no mistake.
36
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,720
We’ve finally…found her.
37
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,050
Kidnapped!
Naruto’s Hot Spring Adventure!
38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,840
We have the pleasure of
a visit from four people and one piglet.
39
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,680
– Welcome! 					– Welcome!
40
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,720
Even though this has mixed bathing…
41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,970
I’m all alone with this brat.
I’m so unlucky.
42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,470
Well then, shall we play pachinko
or something?
43
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,930
We have plenty of time before dinner.
44
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,510
You’re not going to the hot spring?
45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
If we go right now, there are fools…
46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,100
So, let’s go, let’s go.
47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,800
I’m going to get out already.
48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,390
Not yet, not yet.
Not until the girls get here.
49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,180
Oh, I see…
50
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,930
Well, c’mon girls.
All of you, come on…
51
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,390
Welcome!
52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,100
Ah, that was refreshing.
53
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,840
W-We've been robbed!
54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,840
The necklace I got from
Old Lady Tsunade is gone!
55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,140
Where! Where is it?!
56
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,300
"If you want your necklace back,
give back the money"?
57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,930
"Will wait at the three cedars on
the mountain behind."
58
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,550
Signed, the Akagi Family.
59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,390
Money?
60
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,220
What are they talking about?
61
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,800
Girls came in, all right.
62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,390
But…
63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,850
they’re all female monkeys!
64
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
I want to bathe with people.
65
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,850
Hey, here I am!
66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,220
Come out! Akagi Family!
67
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,930
What do you want, kid?!
68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,800
That’s my line!
69
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,100
I haven’t borrowed any money
from you people!
70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,840
So give me my necklace back!
71
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,640
“My” necklace?
72
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,390
Did we mistake his stuff
for that woman's?
73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,350
Ah, that’s it!
Give it back!
74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
W-Wait!
75
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,890
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
76
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,300
Go!
77
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,180
You thieves!
78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
– Take this! 					– Go!
79
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,840
H-Help…
80
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,850
People came, all right…
81
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,600
But…
82
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,600
They’re all men!
83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,470
– Bring it on! 					– Cheers!
84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,760
I want to bathe with women…
85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,390
Huh? So the one who borrowed money
is Old Lady Tsunade?
86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,970
Yes…nicknamed
“the Legendary Sitting Duck.”
87
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,350
She played at the Akagi gambling den
until she was penniless.
88
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,840
We loaned her what she lost.
89
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,640
That’s right, and there’s an I.O.U.
90
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,350
Wha--?! There are so many zeros!
91
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,840
I’m Senta, this guy is called Bunzo.
92
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,260
The boss ordered us to collect
on the debt three years ago…
93
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,350
We set out on a journey
from Akagi Mountain
94
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,050
prepared not to return
until we get the money back.
95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,840
We’ve heard rumors about
the lady here and there…
96
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,930
But, she sure was something.
97
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,970
She was elusive and quite hard to find.
98
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,840
Then recently, we caught
some information that she’d appeared.
99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,350
We were waiting on
the side of the road…
100
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,840
That’s when we came along
with Old Lady Tsunade.
101
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,100
But why did you raid the room
so stealthily?
102
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,720
Rumor has it that
103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,470
that ordinary means don't work
against the “Legendary Sitting Duck.”
104
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,680
We didn’t think that
if we tried to collect amicably,
105
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,430
she would pay us.
106
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,010
She’s certainly stingy…
107
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,260
We heard that she cherished the necklace
next to her life,
108
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,010
so we thought she’d pay
in exchange for it.
109
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,720
No way. After all, you raided my room.
110
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,930
We never even dreamed that the owner
of the necklace would have changed…
111
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,970
Err… Can’t you ask the lady to pay?
112
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,140
Uh, even you say so...
113
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,640
Please! If we don’t get the money back,
we can’t go home!
114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,010
Our wives and kids are waiting for us
to come home!
115
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,800
– Please…I’m begging you!
– Please…I’m begging you!
116
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,470
It’s all gone…
117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,100
Bad luck…
Darn it. I’m stone broke.
118
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,550
Well, let’s call it quits with pachinko.
119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,850
It’s about time for a bath…
120
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,390
– Shizune… 					– Yes?
121
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,050
My bag is at the front desk of the inn.
122
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,350
What?!
Y-You can’t mean to bring it here?!
123
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,600
Everything to your name is in it…
124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,220
I’ve just lost! I can’t repress this feeling!
125
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,600
Just bring it without complaint.
126
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Yes, ma'am!
127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,220
Huh? Could you be…
128
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,800
Y-You are…!
129
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,600
There are women, all right…
130
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,680
But…
131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I was hoping for younger,
more titillating women…
132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,350
This one, right?
133
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,510
Thank you…
134
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,100
Are you with Ms. Tsunade?
135
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,510
Yes.
136
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,260
This came for her not long ago…
137
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,260
To Tsunade
A letter? I wonder who could’ve…?
138
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
139
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
Lady Tsunade!
140
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,890
Huh? Lady Tsunade!
141
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,220
She’s not here…
142
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,050
Okay, Tonton…
143
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,970
You know to search for
Lady Tsunade, right!
144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,100
What, impossible? Why?
145
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,100
I see! The smell of the sulfur
from the hot spring interferes…
146
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,930
Well then, the only way
to search for her is on foot!
147
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,840
Lady Tsunade!
148
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,350
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
149
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,510
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
150
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,840
Where are you!
151
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,800
We have a problem!
152
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Lady Tsunade!
153
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,300
Oh, what in the world should I do?
154
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,430
We have Naruto Uzumaki.
155
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,840
If you want him returned unharmed,
please return all of the money you owe!
156
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,350
We'll wait by the three cedars on
the mountain behind. The Akagi Family
157
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,470
What should I do?
I have to help Naruto.
158
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,010
On top of that, if it’s discovered
that Lady Tsunade has a huge debt,
159
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,180
talk of her installment as
the Fifth Hokage will probably end.
160
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,840
That’s right, we have
to handle this by ourselves.
161
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,850
Right, Tonton?
162
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,930
Do you think it’s going to work out well?
163
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,800
No problem.
164
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,180
Here she comes.
165
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,050
Old Lady Tsunade!
166
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,970
Stop!
167
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,680
You know who we are, right?
168
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,050
You’re the henchmen of the Akagi.
169
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,300
Then I'll make it brief.
170
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,050
Pay back your debt
in one lump sum.
171
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,930
Or else…
172
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,840
his life is over!
173
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Help me!
174
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,760
Whatever.
His life doesn’t matter much to me.
175
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,600
– Huh!
– What did you just say?!
176
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,840
Well then, the money…
177
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,840
Why did it come to this?
178
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,840
This isn’t titillating,
this is just tight!
179
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,840
Drats! Let me have patience!
180
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,300
Didn’t you hear me?
181
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,890
It doesn’t matter to me
what happens with his life.
182
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,970
You… darn old hag!
183
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,760
Was what I would have said,
until just a little bit ago, I think.
184
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,220
Once I become the Hokage,
he’d be a precious subordinate.
185
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,390
I can’t leave him in the mess.
186
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,840
Old Lady Tsunade…
187
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,550
Right now, this is all I’ve got.
Take it.
188
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,260
Let me make sure of this.
189
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,680
I don’t mean it’s paid off in full,
but that’ll do it for the interest, right?
190
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,850
Fake!
191
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,010
You’re not going to pay
the money back?
192
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
It's none of your business.
193
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,220
These guys can’t go home!
Don’t you feel sorry for them!
194
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,140
You couldn’t possibly?
195
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,050
In that case, I’ll have to use force
to get it back!
196
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,680
Naruto’s Shadow Clones?!
197
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,550
I see, Naruto has joined hands
with the Akagi Family…
198
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,180
So, where did Naruto and company go?
199
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
As expected…
200
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,140
I didn’t think she’d hand
the money over meekly.
201
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,640
But to be that much of a coward…
202
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,220
What should we do?
203
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,970
Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase.
204
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,840
No doubt there’s money in it.
205
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,390
We have to do something
to get our hands on that suitcase.
206
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,430
Shoot!
207
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm supposed to be kidnapped,
and she’s casually drinking sake.
208
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,890
It’s that suitcase.
209
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,220
How do we get it out?
210
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,680
Leave it to me.
211
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,840
Lady Tsunade, you’ve returned.
212
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,600
Ah, here’s the suitcase.
213
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,680
It’s dangerous,
so let’s leave it at the front desk.
214
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,840
Well then…
215
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,550
Look, I went and got it!
216
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,850
– You did it! 					– You did it!
217
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Old Lady Tsunade!
218
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,140
Shoot… If you’re the Hokage…
219
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,640
If you’re the Hokage,
220
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,850
then pay your debt back
like a Hokage would!
221
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,180
A Hokage is meant
to protect everyone!
222
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
These guys can’t return their home,
they are desperate!
223
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,470
Why don’t you do something?!
224
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,260
Naruto…
225
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,840
Or do people from other countries
not matter to you?
226
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,140
That kind of Hokage…
I cannot accept!
227
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,760
Now!
228
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,100
Here!
229
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,970
Hurry up and run away!
230
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
– Right! 					– Okay!
231
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,800
Oh, she’s already catching up!
232
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,840
It’s all or nothing!
233
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,100
Huh?
234
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,640
– You did it! 					– You did it!
235
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Tonton?!
236
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,970
Naruto!
237
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,550
Just hand over the suitcase! Or else!
238
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,300
F-Fork over the suitcase!
239
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,840
If we take a direct hit from
Old Lady Tsunade’s attack,
240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,430
then it’s over!
241
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,300
Out of the way, out of the way!
242
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,220
Purse snatchers?
243
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,760
Excuse us!
244
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Hey what’s going on?!
245
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,010
Hey! Don’t cause trouble
for the general public!
246
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,300
It’s because you’re following us!
247
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,180
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
248
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,680
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
249
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,050
What’s going on…?
250
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,470
Naruto, we leave it up to you.
251
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,840
This is no good.
252
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,550
If the contents of that suitcase
become known,
253
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,840
it will be a disaster…
254
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,720
That’s right, that happened too.
255
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,100
And I was young then too.
256
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,720
Gulp it down.
257
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,100
Excuse me, Boss.
258
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,970
What is it? You’re in front of a guest.
259
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,510
W-Well…
260
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
A clone!
261
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,640
That’s a clone too?
262
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,220
Wrong again.
263
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,260
Sheesh, which is the real one?!
264
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
The rest…
265
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,140
– Where are the rest?!
– Where are the rest?!
266
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,890
Over there!
267
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,840
– Hold it! 					– Hold it!
268
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,430
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!
269
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,100
– Wait! 					– Wait!
270
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,100
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!
271
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,840
Prepare yourself!
272
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,680
Shoot, let me go! Let me go!
273
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Settle down!
274
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,840
G-Got it!
275
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
The money!
276
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,180
Okay, they got it!
277
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,350
IOU’s?!
278
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,800
It’s not money?!
279
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,470
– Oh no…
– This is too much!
280
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,760
What are you doing?!
This is in the middle of town!
281
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,800
Huh!
282
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,470
T-Two Old Ladies?!
283
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,100
You’re mixed up in
this commotion as well?
284
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,840
I’d like to hear your reason
for it, Shizune!
285
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,220
Hello… Lady Tsunade…
286
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,300
What?! Shizune…
287
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,220
And you guys belong to the Akagi.
288
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,510
B-Boss Jirocho!
289
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Who?
290
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,930
You don’t know?!
291
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,840
He’s the number one gang boss,
Jirocho from the Land of Tea!
292
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,100
He’s an old friend of mine.
293
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,890
As luck would have it,
we met by accident on the street.
294
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,840
You’re Bunzo and Senta
if I’m not mistaken.
295
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,260
Just in time.
I have something to say to you!
296
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,970
– What?! 					 – What?!
297
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,850
You mean the debt to the Akagi Family?
298
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,260
I paid it back a year ago.
299
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,970
Is that true?
300
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,800
That was last year,
when we were near Akagi’s.
301
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,840
Did you forget?
302
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,470
I-I’m sorry.
303
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,470
Hey!
304
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,600
It’s a circular from Akagi
addressed to me.
305
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
I’ll just read the part addressed to you.
306
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,300
“Senta and Bunzo,
307
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,600
“The debt is paid, come home soon.”
Signed, Shugoro Akagi.
308
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,840
See?
309
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,930
You've gotta be kidding.
310
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,050
All that energy spent, for nothing.
311
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,600
– Thank you for helping us.
– Thank you for helping us.
312
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,470
– Now we can go home relieved.
– Now we can go home relieved.
313
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Go in good spirits.
314
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,840
– You too, Naruto. Take care!
– You too, Naruto. Take care!
315
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,390
Hey, if the suitcase
doesn’t have money in it,
316
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,970
why were you so serious
about getting it back?
317
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,050
That’s…
318
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,510
If the IOU’s were discovered
by the people in the village,
319
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,640
they’ll oppose Lady Tsunade’s
installment as Hokage.
320
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,260
You worry too much.
321
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,970
The Hokage and the debt
are unrelated.
322
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,840
Not only that,
she said she returned the money,
323
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,970
so there’s nothing to worry about.
324
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,510
At least the Akagi debt was…
325
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,470
What?
326
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,260
Don’t worry, don’t worry!
327
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,140
What? We forgot something?
328
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,510
Finally, the time has come.
329
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,010
Communal bathing with girls…
330
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,890
Patience paid off…
331
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,300
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
332
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,800
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
333
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,840
On your still shoulder
334
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,600
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
335
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,100
The city lights are like pieces of stars
336
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,850
That hold us together
337
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:57,720
“Each one of us glows differently,”
338
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,300
you say laughingly
339
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:06,260
but you look most dazzling
340
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,180
Like a comet,
341
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,390
like the rainbow after the storm
342
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,600
You bring light into my heart
343
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:34,840
Being lost can be the answer
344
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:43,840
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
345
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
346
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,050
You're awesome,
Old Lady Tsunade!
347
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,800
Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke
are all right now!
348
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,680
You can't rejoice yet.
349
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,640
The current situation
in the village is serious.
350
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,970
You're right.
I have to do my best,
351
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,510
And work hard for
the village as well.
352
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,430
Hey! N-Naruto,
where do you think you're going?!
353
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,350
I have to fill my stomach first!
354
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,100
You have no sense of emergency…
355
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,640
Next time: "Tsunade's Warning:
Ninja No More!"
356
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,220
What is that supposed to mean?!
//%

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,960
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

Hit it straight like a line drive!

Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,250
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,090
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:44,380
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,750
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,050
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12

We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,790
Hey, Pervy Sage. What Jutsu are you
gonna teach me this time?
21
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,420
The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu,
so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?
22
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,670
Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?
23
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,340
Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!
24
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,130
You keep calling me Pervy Sage.
25
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,250
So you have no idea that
I’m a superb person, huh?
26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,790
Huh…? A superb Pervy Sage?
27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,300
Nhaagh… Listen carefully!
28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,790
Toad Sage is only a disguise!
29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,420
As a matter of fact…!
30
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,790
North and South and East and West!
31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,920
I’m the white-maned toad charmer,
32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,790
and one of the legendary Sannin whom
even celestial beings can’t defeat.
33
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,920
Such a stud!
34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,920
That he strikes fear…
in the hearts of people!
35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,630
I am no other than “Master Jiraiya”!
36
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,790
Yes… 					I’m talking about me!
37
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,790
Huh…
38
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,880
Jiraiya:
Naruto's Potential Disaster
39
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,750
Atafuku Town?
That’s ten kilometers from here!
40
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,840
It’s “O”tafuku Town!
41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,960
Hey…hey… 					Hey, Pervy Sage!
42
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,550
I’m telling you, it’s Jiraiya.
Gimme a break…
43
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,800
So the fact that such
a bigwig Pervy Sage like you
44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,630
is taking me along as
his travel companion means…
45
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,790
that I’m potentially a genius?
46
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,250
Just as I thought!
47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,420
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Why did you choose me?
48
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,790
A long time ago,
the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.
49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,550
And you resemble the Fourth Hokage
so much, it’s almost funny.
50
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,880
That’s the only reason…
51
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,250
I…?
52
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,250
The Fourth Hokage…?
53
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,050
Yeah!
54
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,630
Yeah! Yeah!
55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,170
W-What is it?
56
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,090
Yeah!
57
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,790
The fact that I resemble
the Fourth Hokage means
58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,340
that I also possess genius
of his level, right?
59
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,790
I’ll become the Hokage, after all!
All right!
60
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,250
W-Wait…
61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,420
I stepped on some dog poop!
62
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,090
About the only areas you resemble
the Fourth Hokage
63
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,790
are your hair and your stubbornness!
64
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,550
What was that?!
You senile Pervy Sage!
65
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,460
Not again!
66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,550
Sakura? Come here!
67
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,790
Okay!
68
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,790
Please take these rice sweets
over to Ino’s house.
69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,790
Ino’s house?
70
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,380
These?
71
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,590
That’s right…
72
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,790
Don’t bother them
by staying too long.
73
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,790
Because everyone is
very busy at this time.
74
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,790
I know that!
75
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,500
See you later!
76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,790
Oh, yeah…
77
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,420
I’ll bring some over
to Sasuke later on too.
78
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,460
I wonder if he likes sweets…?
79
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,130
And to Naruto too…
80
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,790
Naruto looks like
he would eat anything…
81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey Kakashi Sensei!
Teach me Chidori too!
82
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,380
You may say teach me,
but it’s not that easy.
83
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,790
What the heck’s that?!
84
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,790
That’s not fair, show me how!
Teach it to me.
85
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,960
Sasuke… Thank you…
86
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,420
You rescued me from
the Sand Ninja, right?
87
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,130
No…
88
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,340
Huh?
89
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,380
For a start, why don’t you try gathering
Chakra in your palms!
90
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,790
All right!
91
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,750
The person who rescued you…
was Naruto.
92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,670
Like this? Like this?
93
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,790
Oh come on, Sasuke,
you’re being overmodest again.
94
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,250
It’s true that Naruto has gotten stronger,
but against that Sand Ninja…
95
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,790
I’m telling you the truth.
96
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,920
That kid fought desperately
to rescue you.
97
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,630
He showed a kind of strength that
he had never shown before.
98
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,550
Naruto rescued…me.
99
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,550
Oh, it’s coming…
100
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,920
Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!
101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,790
All right! I’ll bring some to Naruto too!
102
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,500
I wasn’t…
I wasn’t able to do anything…
103
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:05,920
I don’t want to watch a precious comrade
die right before my eyes ever again…
104
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,670
No matter what,
I will protect you!
105
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,880
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
106
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,380
Summoning Jutsu!
107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,840
Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.
108
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,090
Compared to him, I…
109
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,790
While you may able to
manage against him,
110
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,920
I couldn’t possibly…
111
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,630
He’s in a completely different level…
112
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,170
Yeah…
113
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,790
If we go at each other,
we’ll either both be killed or at best,
114
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,550
kill each other simultaneously.
115
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,130
Even if we increased the numbers,
that wouldn’t change.
116
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,920
I didn’t expect the kid’s guard
would be a legendary Sannin.
117
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,050
With him as the opponent…
118
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,710
the names of Leaf Village’s Uchiha Clan
119
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,790
and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of Mist would be tarnished.
120
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,420
Yeah. However…
121
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,210
Any strong one has a weakness…
122
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,630
Stop! You will get cursed!
123
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,920
Hey, hey, Pervy Sage…
124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,210
Huh?!
125
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,250
What kind of a student was
the Fourth Hokage?
126
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, I guess one could say
127
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,630
that he developed to that extent
because he was my student…
128
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,790
You’re one lucky guy
to be taught by me!
129
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,840
– Hmmm… 					– Hmmm…
130
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,880
Are you dubious?
131
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,300
A good teacher will develop
good disciples.
132
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,000
That goes without saying.
133
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,460
Then, then, who taught you,
Pervy Sage?
134
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,790
Me?
135
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,500
I learned from the Third Hokage.
136
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,800
The Third Hokage?
137
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,590
That’s right…
138
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,050
The Third Hokage was
still young and lively.
139
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,170
– The Third Hokage…young and lively?
– The Third Hokage…young and lively?
140
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,210
That’s right!
I was young and lively too!
141
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,210
Young and lively?!
142
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,790
I…I got tangled up.
143
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,590
See… You got cursed…
144
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,380
So you learned from Kakashi.
145
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,500
Then you experienced
the “Bell Training,” right?
146
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,750
Huh…?
147
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,630
Yeah! I did! Yes I did!
148
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,790
Only I was tied to the tree trunk
and had one deuce of a time…
149
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,250
What? You too?
150
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,790
Huh? What do you mean
by “you too”?
151
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,710
Huh?
152
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,790
What do you mean by “you too”?
153
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,840
Why don’t you just hurry,
get up and return those things.
154
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,500
Even if you were to say that…
it’s pretty difficult…
155
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,340
There are two bells.
156
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,670
The fact that there are
only two means…
157
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,790
That one of us has to go
to the tree trunk…
158
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,590
You’re quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.
159
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,670
All right! I’ll make it!
160
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,130
Come at me with the intent to kill!
161
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,550
Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn’t I?
162
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,090
You got tied to the tree trunk,
after all.
163
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,210
Shut up!
164
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,210
You flat-chested like a cutting board.
165
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,790
What did you say?!
You nerdy perv!
166
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,790
Okay, Okay, that’s enough.
167
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,790
Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
168
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Okay!
169
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,000
You are hopeless…
170
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,790
Ninja shouldn’t be getting caught in
obvious traps like that over and over again.
171
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,920
But…
172
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,250
Why don’t you learn a little
from Orochimaru?!
173
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,050
Sarutobi Sensei, you’re always
saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!
174
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,380
Hm?
175
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,790
When it comes to snooping,
I’m really good at Transparency Jutsu.
176
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,790
Gimme a break…
177
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,750
I don’t even wanna know
178
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,880
what level of Transparency Jutsu
you possess…
179
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,790
I’ve never been caught once!
And that’s the truth!
180
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,460
If you’re that sure of yourself,
I’ll go with you next time…
181
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,630
You’re such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei…
182
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,750
Huh?! Huh?
183
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,790
What, what?
184
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,960
Hey!
185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,210
What’s so funny?! Pervy Sage!
186
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,210
Huh?
187
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,130
It’s just as I said, a good teacher
will develop good disciples.
188
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,550
Huh…? I don’t understand
what you’re saying!
189
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,300
Come on, let’s go.
Did you put it back properly?
190
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,050
Yeah, I fixed them!
191
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
See!
192
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,250
It appears that they haven’t
found Naruto yet.
193
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,380
But don’t you think that’s strange?
194
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,630
Those guys had already
infiltrated the village.
195
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,630
It should be easy to find Naruto
in this village.
196
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,550
Itachi knows Naruto’s face.
197
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,670
Kakashi…
198
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,710
Why is Kakashi sleeping?
199
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,790
Besides, only Jonin are gathering here…
200
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,630
What are you doing?
What in the world happened?!
201
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,550
Nothing…in particular…
202
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,170
Is it true that that
ltachi has returned?!
203
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,960
And moreover,
that he’s after Naruto…?!
204
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,300
Oh…
205
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,550
Idiot…
206
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,790
Why does this always happen?!
207
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,960
So that guy returned to this village?
And moreover, he’s pursuing Naruto?
208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,420
What does all this mean?!
209
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,340
Sasuke?!
210
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,590
Where’s Naruto?!
211
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,250
Huh? I just got here too.
212
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,500
I wanted to give Naruto…
213
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,790
Some sweets…?
214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,300
If Naruto is caught by that guy,
that will spell his end.
215
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,840
I’m not gonna let him do that!
216
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,420
Hey old man!
Naruto must have come here!
217
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,090
And do you know
where he went after that?
218
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,210
Oh, Naruto, right…
219
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,250
If I remember correctly…
220
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,460
Master Jiraiya came here
around noon and…
221
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,000
They ate ramen together,
and he said he was going somewhere…
222
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:13,880
Where?!
223
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,340
Hmm…I think he said to a post station
some distance from the village…
224
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,880
And then he left with Master Jiraiya.
225
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,500
Jiraiya?
226
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,750
Jiraiya – one of the genius Sannin.
227
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,460
Well, in appearance,
228
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,960
he just looks like
a big white-haired old man.
229
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,800
Big and white-haired…
230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,380
H-Hey!
231
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,840
Geez… If you’re gonna
ask somebody a question,
232
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,050
it’s only polite to stay
and have a ramen or something.
233
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,880
Candies are here.
234
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,460
This town is pretty weird.
235
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,000
Naruto!
236
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,880
Huh?
237
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,790
We’re staying here tonight!
238
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,800
What?! I can still walk!
239
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,500
A disciple should obey his master!
240
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,960
I just want to learn the Jutsu!
241
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,630
That’s what’s called a disciple!
242
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,790
Huh?!
243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,790
Oh, oh…!
244
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,300
Naruto!
245
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,590
Yes?
246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,710
Here, this is the key to the room.
247
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,250
Go to the room ahead of me,
practice Chakra,
248
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,790
train some and go to sleep!
249
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,750
Got it?!
250
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,750
What?!
251
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,170
“The adult world is gonna begin
from this point on”…
252
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,750
Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?!
That’s not fair!
253
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,090
That post town isn’t that far…!
254
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,000
This! Somehow this always happens
when I’m with that Pervy Sage!
255
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,750
Darn…
256
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,500
Here…
257
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,340
Candies are here!
258
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,300
I’ve got to check door by door!
259
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,590
Cheers!
260
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,800
I wonder if he really has any inclination
to oversee my training?
261
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,960
What about that one? Yeah that.
262
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,960
See! A hundred out of a hundred!
263
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,790
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age
264
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,590
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?
265
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,460
This is an inn for women only…
266
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,250
I’m looking for someone…
267
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,790
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age
268
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,960
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?
269
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,750
Today, we only have old people.
270
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,790
Hmm…this is kind of crisp
on the tongue…
271
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,790
Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?
272
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,960
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age
273
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,630
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?
274
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,840
White-haired…?
275
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,790
Are they here?!
276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,380
Eh…Do I remember seeing
some people like that earlier
277
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,550
when shifts changed…?
278
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,420
This tastes bitter…
are you all right with it? Cheers!
279
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,380
Oh! A blond kid and
a white-haired old man!
280
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,630
They’re here?!
What’s their room number!
281
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Um…
282
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,840
Room number one at
the end of the hallway
283
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,300
on the second floor…
284
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,630
What’s up?
Has she already dumped you?
285
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,750
Okay, Okay!
286
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,750
Okay, Okay, I’ll open up!
287
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,670
Naruto!
288
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,790
It’s not him…
289
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,710
A cycle of hardship, right?
290
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,670
Inside, we were crying, right?
291
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:39,790
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
292
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,840
It's a secondary role,
293
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,790
a role in the shadows
294
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,050
But in reaching for that dream,
295
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:59,790
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
296
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
297
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,800
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
298
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:19,090
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
299
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,500
Over and over,
we've seen fools
300
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:56,340
Darn it! My body is frozen!
What is this creepy feeling?
301
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,250
This guy is absolutely not
an ordinary person.
302
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,500
He’s got the same Sharingan
as Sasuke.
303
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,790
He’s a member of Uchiha clan.
304
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:09,840
Is this the guy Sasuke
was talking about?
305
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,420
Next time: “Roar, Chidori!
Brother vs. Brother!”
//%
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:09,770
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:18,020
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,310
One more time
4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,020
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,560
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,270
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,940
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,560
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,810
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,890
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:18,020
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:26,890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,890
One more time
15
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,890
– Start the operation!
– Start the operation!
16
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,730
Zero Hour!
The Destruction of
the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!
17
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,900
Lord Hokage!
18
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,270
Leave it to me!
19
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,650
Lord Kazekage!
What is going on?
20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,940
Lord Hokage!
21
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,690
Gaara!
22
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,270
Squad One, above.
23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,850
Squad Two, below!
Protect the lords!
24
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,810
You’re in the way!
25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,020
Lord Hokage… 					Please…flee…
26
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,850
It’s finally our time to
come on the scene.
27
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,350
We’ve been transformed
such a long time.
28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,060
I’m totally pent up with frustration.
29
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,890
You guys smell all sweaty!
30
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,650
Come on, we’re all comrades, right…?
31
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,100
Sound Ninja…!
32
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,100
Raido…
33
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,270
We’re heading out to
back up Lord Hokage.
34
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,310
Be careful of any traps!
35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,940
Do it…
36
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,890
Yes sir!
37
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,100
– Ninja Art! 					– Ninja Art!
38
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,310
– Four Flames Formation!
– Four Flames Formation!
39
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,890
Barrier…!
40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,980
Lord Kazekage…
41
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,440
Barrier Ninjutsu, huh?!
42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,890
To think that they could outwit Anbu…
43
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,020
They're not just ordinary…
44
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,940
What are you doing here?!
Lord Hokage is in danger!
45
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,310
What a nuisance…
46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,190
To think that the enemy was
masquerading as our Anbu…
47
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,310
So it was also that guy
who used Genjutsu!
48
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,060
Yeah…there’s no mistake.
49
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,810
I didn’t expect that…
50
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,890
Sand Village would betray Leaf Village.
51
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,730
The treaty is simply a camouflage to
make the enemy let down their guard.
52
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,060
The petty little battle game ends now.
53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,770
From this point on, the course
of history will change!
54
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,890
Are you saying that
you’re starting a war?
55
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,190
That’s right.
56
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,890
One should avoid resolution
through armed force
57
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,310
and should rather seek
a solution through negotiations.
58
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,890
There’s still time…Lord Kazekage!
59
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,890
Perhaps one gets addicted to
peace as one grows older…
60
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,730
Sarutobi Sensei!
61
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,100
You’re…
62
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,270
Just my bad luck…
63
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,270
to have lookout duty
on a day like this.
64
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,890
I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too.
65
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Stop fussing.
66
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,890
The Chunin Exam takes
place twice a year.
67
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,890
You’ll have many more chances
to see it.
68
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,100
But this year, that kid from
the Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?
69
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,940
And I won’t have
a chance to see that…
70
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,520
I won’t be able to die peacefully.
71
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,230
What’s that?!
72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,650
It’s time! Begin!
73
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,060
The Summoning has succeeded.
74
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,890
Huge boa!
75
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,940
Notify Lord Hokage immediately!
76
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,890
I’m not letting you in the village!
77
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,190
Dispatch the reinforcements immediately!
78
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,980
Yes sir!
79
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,890
Sand Ninja!
80
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,440
What’s going on?
81
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,940
Stop that, Gaara!
82
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,650
I’ll kill him…!
83
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,520
There’s no meaning in
continuing this fight!
84
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,190
Don’t forget our mission!
85
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,690
Out of my way…!
86
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,560
What are you guys doing?!
87
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,310
The operation is already underway!
88
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,100
What in the world is going on?
89
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,890
Gaara!
90
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,100
What’s the matter?!
91
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,730
His wound is deeper than
I thought!
92
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,890
And moreover his Chakra
is pretty drained!
93
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,190
In that case,
what about using that thing…?
94
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,150
That’s impossible to do right away!
95
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,890
Idiot! It’s all because
you didn’t wait for the signal
96
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,980
and tried to become
the Perfect Possession…
97
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,890
What should we do?!
98
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,890
Are you saying we have to do
this without Gaara?
99
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Isn’t Gaara here yet?!
100
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,810
Gaara is Sand’s trump card.
101
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,190
We have to get Gaara to do his work,
no matter what!
102
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,600
You guys leave for the moment and
tend to Gaara’s wounds!
103
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,400
As soon as Gaara’s Chakra has
been restored…
104
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,310
the operation will recommence!
105
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,890
Got it!
106
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,890
What about you, Sensei?!
107
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,480
I’m gonna suppress those guys!
108
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,400
Do you think things will
go according to your plan?
109
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,020
I’ll make them so…
110
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,440
Go!
111
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,310
Okay!
112
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,890
Is Orochimaru the host of this party?
113
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,600
Dunno… In any case,
let’s heat this thing up.
114
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,520
Sasuke…
115
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,890
Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.
116
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,900
You’ve already achieved Chunin level.
117
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,060
If you’re a Leaf Shinobi,
be of service to the Leaf!
118
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,230
In other words, I’m supposed to
take down that jerk Gaara, right?
119
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,890
A continuation of earlier on, right?
120
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,560
Don’t pursue too far.
121
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,890
From here on, it’s no longer an exam.
lt’s the real thing!
122
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,890
What I have to do though…
is the same!
123
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,890
I won’t let him through!
124
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,270
Sasuke…!
125
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,100
Boy oh boy…
126
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,060
We intended to take Sasuke
while Gaara was causing the trouble.
127
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,900
But not everything goes as planned.
128
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,730
I see… Is that so?
129
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,890
So Leaf Village and…
Sasuke were the target, huh?
130
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,150
Is the Leaf such a big catch?
131
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,900
More importantly,
if Gaara wakes up,
132
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,190
I’ll be able to show you something
much more interesting.
133
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,400
Well, anyway…
134
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,850
Your thick-headedness has caused
the Leaf to be outmaneuvered.
135
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,230
It’s my win.
136
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,940
Nothing is decided
until the very end.
137
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,890
I believe that’s what I taught you…
138
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,520
Orochimaru.
139
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,890
I thought this day would
eventually arrive.
140
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,890
However…
141
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,770
You won’t get my head that easily!
142
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,890
I told you, didn’t I?
143
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,890
It is preferable to decide
the Fifth Hokage quickly…
144
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,890
Third Hokage…
145
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,350
because you will…die here.
146
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,890
I wonder how the Chunin Exams
are going?
147
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,650
I wonder if Naruto’s match is over yet?
148
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,690
The first match was
with Neji, right?
149
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
I want him to win that
match somehow or other.
150
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,850
That’s no good!
151
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,100
A teacher mustn’t root for
one particular student!
152
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,100
All the graduating students
are dear to him!
153
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,980
I must root for all of them equally!
154
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,890
But I still…want Naruto to win…
155
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,850
Are you worried about Naruto?
156
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,400
Well, of course…!
157
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,810
As I thought…
158
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,150
Y-You guys…
159
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,890
I told you to do ten laps around
the school grounds, didn’t I?!
160
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,400
We finished that long ago.
161
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,100
While you were daydreaming, Sensei.
162
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,890
When our teacher is in that state,
he can’t teach a class!
163
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,520
So let’s call it quits for today!
164
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,150
N-No, no!
I’m continuing with class.
165
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,520
I wonder what that smoke is…?
166
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,520
That’s coming from the direction
of the exam arena…
167
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,310
Isn’t there some disturbance
to the east?
168
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,270
I wonder if something happened?
169
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,890
That Orochimaru…
170
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,560
What should we do?
171
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,190
Should we send reinforcements?
172
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,890
No… It’s dangerous to make a move
when we don't really know
173
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,940
what the situation is.
174
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,890
If the mastermind is Orochimaru…
175
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,900
even more so.
176
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,440
Is Orochimaru…
that dangerous a guy?
177
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,350
Originally…he was a student
of the Third Hokage.
178
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,480
So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?
179
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,520
Long ago, when the Fourth Hokage
was decided…
180
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,230
Orochimaru apparently asserted that
he was capable of taking on that role.
181
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,810
But his request was denied.
182
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,600
And shortly afterwards,
that guy slipped out of this village.
183
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,850
Orochimaru most likely holds
a grudge against
184
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,650
the Third Hokage because of that.
185
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,230
Revenge…is it?
186
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,770
Probably.
187
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,890
Long ago, when I was a kid…
188
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,810
there’s one thing I remember
thinking when I saw that guy…
189
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,350
That he didn’t seem human…
190
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,150
That he seems to be something
that just took on a human form…
191
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,270
Frightening…
192
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,890
Simply…frightening.
193
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,600
Reporting!
194
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,520
A large boa has appeared near
the eastern gate of the Leaf Village!
195
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,350
And behind it, some one hundred
Sand Ninja are infiltrating the country!
196
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,890
They are currently engaged in
armed conflict with our Shinobi
197
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,690
who were patrolling nearby!
198
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,350
The Sand…?!
199
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,690
Leave Squad One and Two behind
and make for the eastern gate.
200
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,440
Immediately!
201
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,480
– Yes sir! 					– Yes sir!
202
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,690
We won’t let you past this point!
203
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,890
There’s quite a large number.
204
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,060
We were careless!
205
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
And even Lord Hokage has been…
206
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,890
Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier!
207
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,890
Yeah.
208
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,480
What…?
209
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,730
Orochimaru!
210
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,270
Orochimaru?!
211
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,150
Why is that guy…?
212
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,850
Don’t tell me that
they’re after Sasuke again?!
213
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,350
Sasuke!
214
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,480
Huh?
215
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,600
He’s not there…?
216
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,890
Sakura, stay there for a while.
217
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,890
I’m gonna go reduce
the number of enemies.
218
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,310
Darn! I’m worried about
Lord Hokage, but…
219
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,060
Leave above to Anbu.
220
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,810
Besides…
221
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,850
Lord Hokage isn’t the kind of guy
who can be taken down that easily.
222
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,890
But…
223
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:36,060
After all, he is the Hokage of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
224
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,600
Are you so happy, you’re crying?
225
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,560
Or…
226
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:59,400
do you have an iota of sadness
in your heart to kill me, your teacher?
227
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,980
No…
228
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,190
Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy…
229
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,600
but I’m finally awake.
230
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,940
That’s what I thought.
231
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,890
I know you aren’t someone
who would hold a grudge.
232
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,770
You have neither a goal nor motive.
233
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,400
Hmm… I guess…
234
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,690
I do kind of have a goal.
235
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,940
If I were to explain it…
236
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,730
It’s interesting to watch things
that move.
237
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,770
I get no pleasure if
something doesn’t move.
238
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,690
Like a windmill that doesn’t turn…
239
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,060
Well, it may have some kind
of appeal once in a while.
240
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,060
But usually,
it’s not worth looking at it.
241
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,600
Right now…with a wind called
“Destroy the Leaf Village,”
242
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,100
I want to turn that windmill.
243
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,890
You’re the same as always…
244
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,150
Sakura!
245
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,890
It was worth teaching you Genjutsu
survival training
246
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,350
during the Genin Exam.
247
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,890
You truly have a talent for it.
248
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:49,890
Huh?
249
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,900
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
250
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,850
Naruto will be delighted.
251
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,100
He’ll be getting a mission
after such a long while.
252
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,900
What do you mean by a mission?
253
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,060
Be careful…
254
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,890
It’s the first A-ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.
255
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:30,230
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
256
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:41,560
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
257
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,230
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
258
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,350
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
259
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,690
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
260
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,890
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
261
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:22,980
Everyone makes mistakes
It’s nothing to be ashamed about
262
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:33,890
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
263
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:44,440
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
264
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,980
Forge on strong
264.01	02:38:02:02	02:38:05:10	Yes! I've been waiting for this!
265
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,350
Finally, it’s the first A-Ranked mission
in a while!
266
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,150
Listen, Sakura and Shikamaru!
267
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,890
As long as I’m with you,
it will be an easy one.
268
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,810
I’m the super hero who
can wake a sleeping lion.
269
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,940
Just keep watching
Mr. Naruto’s stellar performance!
270
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,900
Next time: “Village in Distress:
A New A-Ranked Mission!”
271
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,890
Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!
//%
1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:09,810
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:18,060
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,360
One more time
4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,060
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,610
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,310
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,980
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,610
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:54,850
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,850
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,900
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:18,060
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,850
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,900
One more time
15
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,270
Master Jiraiya…I believe in you.
16
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,690
The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!
17
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,190
Well well…
18
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,690
You don’t sleep at all?
19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,940
What do you want?
20
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,150
I thought I’d crush you now.
21
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,150
If I do that,
there’d be the possibility for me,
22
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,850
after the first battle,
to be able to fight Sasuke.
23
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,150
I know your Sand attack.
24
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,940
I wonder which is faster,
yours or my Sound.
25
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,810
In the full moon…
26
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,110
in the full moon, his blood boils.
27
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,810
W-What the heck…are you?
28
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,770
Amazing… So that’s his true form?
29
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,850
But…is it okay?
He’s a Sound Ninja …
30
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,190
It’s all right.
He’s long since served his purpose.
31
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,850
I thought he was a guinea pig
in order to see…
32
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,850
the power of the boy
called Sasuke or something…
33
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,020
Why…is he with the Sand Ninja?
34
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,150
No, that’s not necessary anymore…
35
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,850
Actually, I’d already been ordered
to seize Sasuke.
36
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,400
But I failed…
37
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,060
What did you say?
38
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,900
That’s right.
39
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,020
…for the likes of you?
40
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,440
Are you looking to take me on?
41
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,310
You willful little brat…
Don’t mess around with grown-ups.
42
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,860
Don’t be so arrogant.
The situation is in my favor.
43
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,850
It’s also been found out that
I’m a minion of the Sound.
44
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,850
Then…if they find out that you’re
having a secret meeting here with me…
45
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,520
the plan to destroy the Leaf Village
and everything will be for naught!
46
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,560
I heard…
that you’re Orochimaru’s right-hand man.
47
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,060
Being revealed to them and coming
nonchalantly to meet with me…
48
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,360
You must be a fool.
49
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,610
Well…to be exact, my true identity
wasn’t found out…
50
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,360
I let them find out.
51
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,060
I wanted to see how far
the Leaf Village would go…
52
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,310
Even after that it wouldn’t
be too late to seize Sasuke.
53
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,690
If you guys are going to fail,
we’ll back off immediately…
54
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,440
It’s a plan that was originally
posed by the Sound, so.
55
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,480
The Sand is invisible until
the last moment.
56
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,850
This is the will of the Kazekage.
57
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,850
Holy smokes…
58
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,980
That’s fine.
59
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,690
This is the carry-out plan from Sound.
60
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,850
Okay.
61
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,730
And please…tell them about
this plan soon.
62
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,480
Yeah.
63
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,850
I know.
64
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,190
Okay, I’ll be going.
65
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,850
To think our allied nation,
the Village Hidden in the Sand,
66
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,060
has been already associated
with the Sound…?!
67
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,850
I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick.
68
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,770
Oh, by the way…
69
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,860
I’ll take care of the clean up.
70
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,610
No, I’ll do it…
71
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,610
As the member of Sand Village
of the Land of Wind,
72
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,980
I must do what I can for my allies…
73
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,110
Besides…it’s just one mouse.
74
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,190
It’ll be easy.
75
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,270
Well well, it’s Mr. Proctor.
76
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,060
What in the world are you
doing here alone?
77
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,520
It seems I have no choice,
but to fight.
78
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,360
Leaf Style…
79
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,810
Crescent  Moon Dance!
80
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,940
I can’t pull it out.
81
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,610
This technique is…
the Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance.
82
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,110
Being able to manage it
at such a young age.
83
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,850
As expected,
this village is full of talented Ninja.
84
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,850
Your talent with a sword is superb.
85
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,020
But, a real sword with substance
can be stopped.
86
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,230
However…a Wind sword can’t
be stopped by anyone.
87
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,020
Take that!
88
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,730
That does it!
89
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,270
Nice, nice.
90
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,850
Hey…
91
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,850
This is paradise.
92
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,230
Hey, I said.
93
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,980
Isn’t it time for you to turn
this way already?
94
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,900
If you join my training,
I’ll give you lots of “service.”
95
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,850
P-l-e-a-s-e.
96
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,610
So you finally came out…
I was waiting for you.
97
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,690
What?!
98
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,190
Are you making fun of me?
99
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,310
Right back at you.
100
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,520
I’m hungry.
101
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,440
Let’s get back to the inn.
102
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,310
Owww, darn it!
103
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,230
Okay…I’ll teach you a technique.
104
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,190
Do you really mean that?
105
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,270
Do you remember what I told you
yesterday about the two types of Chakra?
106
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,850
Huh? Yesterday’s talk?
107
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,900
You know, what you said about blue
and red Chakra or something.
108
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,850
Oh… What about it?
109
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,400
You said that when a great power
came out, you felt red Chakra.
110
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah, it was like that.
111
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,190
Try building up that red Chakra right now.
112
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,110
Hmm. Even you say so…
113
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,360
I’ll give it a try, but…
114
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
How about it?
115
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,850
Hmm, it’s not right.
116
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,900
It’s the same Chakra as always.
117
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,850
Jeez, you have no talent.
118
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,900
Don’t be talking all high and mighty!
119
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
In the first place,
120
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,560
I really don’t understand those
two types of Chakra myself!
121
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,060
Just keep trying.
122
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,150
Humph… So he doesn’t understand it…
himself, eh.
123
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,310
It seems Naruto himself still hasn’t
realized that
124
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,060
the red Chakra is
the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra.
125
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,860
Well, guessing from his story…
126
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,520
it seems the excitement of danger
and heightened emotion
127
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
are the key to summon
the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.
128
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,060
No good, not good.
129
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,850
Only the usual Chakra’s coming out.
130
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,850
Say, Pervy Sage…
131
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,060
What the heck does the red Chakra and
the technique you’re going to teach me
132
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,270
have to do with each other?
133
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,850
Listen, boy.
134
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,770
For the technique
I’m about to teach you,
135
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,400
the Chakra you’ve had until now
is not nearly enough.
136
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,610
Therefore, you’ll have to able to
pull out and use the “other” Chakra
137
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,730
that has been dormant within
you at any time you need.
138
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,110
But how do you know that
I have such a Chakra?
139
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,980
Oh, just what I wanted to hear.
140
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,400
Actually…
141
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,560
it’s because I’m a sage.
142
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,310
Jeez…that’s no answer.
143
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,520
Anyway, the special Chakra
that only you have
144
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,850
will become your greatest weapon.
145
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,900
Greatest weapon?
146
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,850
Not using that is like wasting treasure.
147
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,520
There’s no need to forcedly do
the same training as everyone else.
148
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Everyone has what they’re good at
and poor at.
149
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,980
You have your own style.
150
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,770
Your training until now, maintaining
and releasing a set amount of Chakra,
151
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,150
was in other words,
152
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,650
training to control the suppression of
Chakra so that you wouldn’t get exhausted.
153
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,610
But you who have a lot of stamina
154
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,360
should be about power rather
than a cheap trick.
155
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,730
You, who has two types of Chakra
and doesn’t exhaust easily,
156
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,850
should release the largest amount
of Chakra you can
157
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,400
and train to increase the absolute amount
of Chakra that you can use.
158
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,900
Then there are tons of Jutsu
and techniques you can use.
159
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,730
What, for example?
160
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,230
For example…summoning Jutsu
that I’m going to teach you now.
161
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,150
Summoning?
162
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,520
Right.
163
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,850
It’s a type of spatio-temporal technique
164
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,360
where you sign a contract in blood
with all kinds of living creatures
165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,310
and summon whenever you like
with Ninjutsu.
166
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,770
Oh! That sounds awesome.
Teach me quick!
167
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,980
Before that…
168
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,730
first, it’s necessary to
use up all of your usual Chakra.
169
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,770
Okay!
170
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,850
Leave it to me.
171
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,060
Well… So you can use the
Shadow Clone Jutsu.
172
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,310
I have a good idea how to get rid
of my Chakra quickly.
173
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,940
Well, you’ve multiplied quite a bit.
174
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,650
Listen up. We’re going to have
a battle royal now.
175
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,150
The last one left will be
the strongest me…
176
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,520
We’re going to determine
the me among me!
177
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,110
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
178
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,850
I see.
Good thinking considering he’s stupid.
179
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,650
Okay, let’s go!
180
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,270
My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.
181
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,770
The finale is near at last.
182
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,850
Well done.
183
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,850
Sure enough, I’m the strongest me.
184
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,810
It looks like you’ve finally used up
almost all of your Chakra.
185
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,850
Now, at last I’ll teach you
the technique.
186
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Oh, I’ve been waiting!
187
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,850
First, I’ll show you.
188
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,850
Watch carefully.
189
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,860
Summoning Jutsu!
190
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,980
Ooh, so cool.
191
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,150
Open that scroll.
192
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,850
It’s a contract with the
summoning toads
193
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,310
that I’ve taken over from generations.
194
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,900
Sign your name in your own blood
195
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,480
and stamp the fingerprints of one hand
in blood under that.
196
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,440
Then build up Chakra in the place
you want to summon
197
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,690
and set down the hand you contracted.
198
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,230
The Sign is
Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
199
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:34,190
NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.
200
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,060
Okay…This is fine, right?
201
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,730
It’s easier for you to release
red Chakra right now.
202
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,850
So give it a try.
203
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,850
I already am.
204
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,060
Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.
205
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,770
Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.
206
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,480
A tadpole…
207
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,650
This kid…has no talent, after all.
208
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,940
Hayate…what in the world happened?
209
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,690
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
210
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,940
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
211
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,560
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
212
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,850
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
213
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:46,230
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
214
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:53,610
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
215
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,440
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
216
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,850
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
217
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,110
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
218
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,520
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
219
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:23,810
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
220
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:31,060
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
221
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,730
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
222
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:44,850
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
223
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,400
Ino! When I was going to visit
Sasuke at the hospital by myself…
224
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,650
why are you coming along?
225
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,850
Besides, what is that flower all about?
226
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,850
A "rose for love"?
That's so lame.
227
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,440
I chose this daffodil for him,
hoping Sasuke will get better soon.
228
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,850
Next time, "A Feeling of Yearning,
A Flower Full of Hope"
229
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,110
Cha! This is it!
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,220
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,120
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,000
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,170
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,210
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,050
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,420
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,750
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,260
Curse Sealing!
20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,810
Out of character.
21
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,550
It appears he’s quite tired…
22
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,520
To think you’ve become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu…
23
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,390
You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?
24
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,430
You...
25
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,710
Long time no see, Kakashi.
26
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,780
Orochimaru…
27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,850
Kakashi vs. Orochimaru:
Face to Face!
28
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,250
Sorry, but…
29
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,560
I have no business with you, Kakashi.
30
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,860
But I do with the kid behind you.
31
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,770
Why are you after Sasuke…?!
32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,510
It’s good for you.
You already got it, right?
33
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,110
You didn’t have it before, did you…?
34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,550
That.
35
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,550
That...
36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,550
left eye Sharingan!
37
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,730
I want it, too…
38
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,560
The Uchiha power.
39
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,110
Come on. Get up.
40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,560
W-What?!
41
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,550
B-Bugs?
42
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,320
They burst through the skin…
from inside his body?!
43
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,220
What a creepy guy!
44
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Heh! What kind of bluff
are you trying to pull?
45
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,550
These things are called Parasitic Insects.
46
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,720
They attack their pray in groups
and eat Chakra…
47
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,690
If attacking in this amount…
48
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,690
you’re finished, no mistake.
49
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,900
If you don’t like that, give up.
50
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
That would be in your best interests.
51
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,070
If you use your left arm
technique on me,
52
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,910
I’ll simultaneously have the bugs exploit
the opening from behind.
53
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,210
Conversely, if you use
your technique on the bugs,
54
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,940
I’ll simultaneously exploit the opening…
55
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,150
Either way, you won’t be able
to get through this.
56
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,360
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside.
57
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,600
Hey! Hold it!
58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,970
You little thief!
59
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,280
Someone! Grab him!
60
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,220
Uh-oh.
61
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,220
Man, what a pigheaded kid.
62
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,750
Making us go to trouble!
63
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,550
You have potential, boy.
64
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,140
I liked your eyes earlier…
65
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,550
If you come with me,
you can become strong.
66
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,890
Follow me.
67
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,570
If you come with me,
you can become strong.
68
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,970
You can become strong.
69
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,030
Fight for me. If you do that…
70
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,560
I’ll make you stronger.
71
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,060
Now, please live up to my expectations…
72
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,540
No longer...
73
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,070
will I...
74
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,850
It seems like you’re proud
of your arms. You!
75
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,590
S-Stop it!
76
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,060
Stop!
77
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,960
No longer...
78
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,440
can I make things
blow up in my face!
79
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,550
Don’t... underestimate me!
80
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,470
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside, right?!
81
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,920
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside, right?
82
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,090
What?! He could already
use his right arm?!
83
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,170
So the first half of the battle was
a strategic move
84
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,900
to make us think he couldn’t
use his right arm.
85
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,710
Not bad…Zaku.
86
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,980
What’s your purpose?
87
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,890
The recently built Sound Village.
That’s my village, you see…
88
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,260
You already understand, don’t you…?
89
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,560
Humph! Ridiculous ambition.
90
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,970
Oh, my… you said it.
91
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,510
But, for that I need various pieces
who will obey my every whim.
92
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,640
Take this!
93
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,820
So Sasuke is one of those pieces?
94
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,350
No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.
95
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,820
And the ones who are taking
the exams now…
96
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,460
are mere throw-away pieces.
97
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,680
My arms!
98
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,860
What’s this?!
99
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,460
Earlier when I recommended
that you give up…
100
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,900
as a precautionary measure,
I gave a suggestion to the bugs…
101
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:47,540
to block that troublesome wind hole
with their bodies and remain still.
102
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,540
This is what a real ace in the hole is.
103
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,550
Punk!
104
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,550
Don’t…come any closer... to Sasuke!
105
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,400
Even if you’re one of
the legendary three Ninja,
106
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,170
at the least,
I can kill you as you kill me!
107
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,950
What’s funny?
108
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,590
What you say and what you do,
are all off.
109
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,890
What?
110
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,220
There’s no point at all in
attempting such a seal.
111
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,930
You understand, don’t you?
112
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
The heart to seek out
in pursuit of the goal,
113
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,730
no matter what obstructive power
there may be…
114
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,000
He is the possessor of that quality.
115
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,310
He’s an avenger…
116
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,710
So you took advantage of that, eh?
117
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,610
However, Sasuke is…
118
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,550
At some point,
he will definitely seek me out…
119
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,250
in search of power.
120
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,460
Oh, and, you’re going to kill me…?
121
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,560
Why don’t you try?
122
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
That is, if you can…
123
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,680
Kill you as you kill me…?!
124
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,980
Am I an idiot…?
125
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,540
It seems…it’s over.
126
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,540
The winner! Shino Aburame!
127
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,090
W-What is he, Neji?!
128
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,520
Byakugan!
129
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,570
He’s something else…!
130
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,000
I can understand him calling bugs
with a Summoning Jutsu…
131
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,340
but he harbors bugs all over his body.
132
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,710
S-Say what?!
133
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,710
He’s of the bug tamer race that
is passed down in the Leaf Village.
134
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,150
Speaking of which,
I’ve heard of it…
135
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,320
The story of a race that as
they come into this world,
136
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,390
possess the secret technique of loaning
their bodies to bugs
137
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,560
as a nest and fight using these bugs.
138
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,500
They fully control the bugs and
entrust most of the battle to the bugs…
139
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,900
I hear that they contract to keep
giving the bugs their own Chakra
140
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,540
as food for compensation.
141
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,520
So he’s…the successor?
142
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,220
That was unfortunate, Zaku.
143
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Why’d that happen to Zaku’s arms?
144
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,560
Probably, that guy called
Shino or whatever…
145
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,730
exploited the opening and
stuck those bugs
146
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,670
into the exhaust opening in Zaku’s hands.
147
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,540
If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave
in that condition,
148
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,110
the energy with no way out
would expand in search of an exit…
149
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,050
His arms that are
gun barrels blow up…
150
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,460
and become useless.
151
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,000
Our relationship was only that
of having been given the same mission…
152
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,540
but... I’ll even the score for you.
153
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,380
Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed…
154
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,710
What?! What?!
155
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,550
So Shino, you were that strong,
weren’t you?! Dang it!
156
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,020
I thought he was
a creepy person from long before, but…
157
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,360
Oh…
158
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,930
S-Shino, good…work…
159
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,770
Hey, you did it!
160
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes… I’m counting on you guys, too.
161
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,450
He comes back like he’s
the team leader or something! Dang it!
162
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,220
Umm, now then, I would like to
get right to the next match.
163
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Kakashi Sensei!
164
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,360
Yo!
165
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,790
Not, “Yo!” Kakashi Sensei!
166
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,300
What about Sasuke? Is he okay?
167
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,930
Well, he’s fine.
168
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,900
He’s sleeping soundly in the infirmary.
169
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,540
However, with Anbu Ops
standing as guards…
170
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,510
Oh.
171
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,550
Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro
172
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,550
It’s finally my turn.
173
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Kankuro, he’s totally underestimating this…
174
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,260
Humph. Idiot…
175
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,510
It’s him…!
176
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,090
Unlike Yoroi, I don’t get
careless with kids at all.
177
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,090
I’ll say this first, once I do my technique…
178
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,560
give up no matter what…
179
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,570
I’ll bring it to an end swiftly.
180
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,540
If so, I’ll also…
181
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,540
bring it to an end swiftly!
182
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,650
Now then, please begin…
183
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,820
the third battle!
184
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,100
Hey, can you hear it?
185
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:34,470
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
186
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:43,980
The ocean spans limitlessly
187
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,360
Please keep that smile on your face forever
188
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,260
Or else I’ll cry
189
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,130
You won't have to search around you
190
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,670
It’s all ok now.
191
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:15,550
Everyone is inside
this hand
192
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:21,080
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
193
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,560
When you forget what happiness is
194
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,460
Just sing.
195
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,730
Light is born, and darkness was born
196
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,070
The two are one
197
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:43,510
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
198
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:49,010
Hey, can you hear it?
199
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
I believed in your words the whole time.
200
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,260
I wanted to be like you.
201
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
I thought it would be nice
if that happened.
202
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,130
So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you.
203
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,960
I’m no longer like I was before.
204
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,270
There’s no point if I don’t
exceed the serious you.
205
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,270
Next episode: “Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious!”
206
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,580
Let’s have a fair fight.
//%
1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,160
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,030
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,200
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,620
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,620
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,630
Now
12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,450
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,790
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,620
…bring it to an end swiftly!
20
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,390
I won’t let you do anything.
21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,990
First move, a surefire victory!
22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,740
Wow! That’s amazing!
23
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,540
What’s with his body?!
24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,110
I dislocate every joint
25
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,450
and with Chakra, I can control
my softened body at will.
26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,620
With Chakra…?
27
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,630
I can also squeeze until
your bones break.
28
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,660
I’ll rapidly tighten as long
as you don’t give up.
29
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,600
I don’t know what kind of
ninja tool you’ll use…
30
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,600
but if I keep doing this to your body,
it will make no difference.
31
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,370
I can break your neck right now.
32
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,510
So hurry up and give up.
33
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,580
No.
34
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,620
Do you want to die?!
35
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,090
Idiot. You’re the one who’s
going to die.
36
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,330
His neck is broken.
37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,500
What?
38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,740
How ridiculous…
39
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,910
Phew…
40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,610
Idiot.
41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,110
I went a little overboard and
ended up killing you.
42
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,120
W-What?
43
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,790
Okay, now it’s my turn.
44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,500
T-This is a Puppet!
45
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,510
T-That’s the real body?
46
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,620
He’s…a Puppet Master…
47
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,920
He’s controlling the puppet with
Chakra from his hand!
48
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,830
G-Give up…!
49
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,840
If your bones get crushed,
you’ll be able to bend even more, huh?
50
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,750
For once, I was close to stopping
the match in the middle.
51
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,260
The winner, by an inability
to continue the match by the opponent,
52
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,260
is Kankuro.
53
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,590
Two against one is hitting
below the belt!
54
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,500
Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!
55
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,630
It’s not particularly hitting
below the belt.
56
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,470
It’s a puppet, after all.
57
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,570
That’s the Puppet Master Jutsu.
58
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,670
He’s controlling the puppet with Chakra.
59
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,610
It’s the same as using
a ninja tool-- like shuriken.
60
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,480
They’re all great Chakra users…
61
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,290
I thought I could make it
kind of far with Chakra.
62
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,790
Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious!
63
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,680
Ino…!
64
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,180
You’ve got the jitters,
don’t you, Sakura?
65
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,280
Wha…?!
66
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,820
Even Sasuke collapsed.
67
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,760
I mean, it felt like it was because
it was Sasuke that it ended at that.
68
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,630
What’ll happen if you take part?
69
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,830
It might be best if you quit!
70
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,040
Something like that
won’t work on me!
71
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,390
It’s okay! I can tough it out
this time around, too.
72
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,460
Quit? Who?
73
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,540
I can hardly wait.
74
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,410
Cha! Bring it on!
75
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,620
Now then, to continue,
we will begin the fourth battle.
76
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,860
Man, man, nothing but
weirdoes all over the place!
77
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,630
Don’t you say that!
78
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,630
You’ve got a point.
79
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,470
You, too, Sakura?!
80
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,840
This isn’t the time to be laughing.
81
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,140
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
82
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,740
I never thought…
I’d be fighting you, Sakura.
83
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,710
And what’s more, so soon.
84
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,680
Ino was a standout
among the rookie Kunoichi.
85
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,250
With Sakura as her opponent,
86
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,890
will she go…no,
can she go with serious intent?
87
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,960
To think it would be those
two of all people.
88
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,830
Things have gotten gloomy.
89
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,500
I wonder if Ino’ll be okay.
90
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,470
That’s for sure.
91
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
What’re you going to do, Ino?
92
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,540
Sakura! Good luck! Don’t lose!
93
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,610
Begin!
94
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,030
Oh, no. I knew it.
95
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,500
Sakura’s totally blowing Ino away!
96
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,570
Idiot.
97
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,600
Say what?!
98
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,040
If you’re not an idiot,
you must be sleeping, aren’t you?
99
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,170
Who…?!
100
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,610
Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.
101
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,910
So this is their level of
hand-to-hand combat?
102
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,750
What?!
103
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,620
It’s not because they’re Kunoichi.
104
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,820
Huh?
105
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,020
It’s just that those two are lukewarm.
There’s no man or woman in battle.
106
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,330
Lukewarm…?
107
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,780
There!
108
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,620
Kunoichi must learn
not only Ninjutsu…
109
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,260
but also a wide range of
knowledge and refinement as women.
110
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,330
If you don’t blend into enemy territory
and conduct yourselves as a normal woman…
111
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,300
you’ll have it rough on occasions
such as when you work as spies.
112
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,170
Today’s class is flower arranging.
113
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,670
Now then, everyone.
114
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,280
Let’s gather flowers we like.
115
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,780
Yes, ma’am!
116
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,420
Ino, wait up!
117
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,460
You’re such a klutz.
118
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,140
I’m... not good at stuff like this.
119
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
What about you, Ino?
120
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,780
That’s no good, considering
your name’s Sakura.
121
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,110
Listen. There are tricks
to things like this.
122
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,750
You know, as for flower arranging,
123
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,320
after you’ve decided on a main flower,
you add other flowers to decorate.
124
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,390
All flowers can’t be
asserting themselves.
125
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,260
For example…look.
126
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,970
You can see those cosmos
flowers over there, right…?
127
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,700
For example, if they were
the main flowers…
128
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,610
the thoroughwort flowers
you picked are throw-ins!
129
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,380
As contrasted with
spring cherry blossoms,
130
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,450
cosmos flowers have the
name of autumn cherry blossom
131
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,250
and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.
132
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,820
Also, they’re flowers with
the original meaning of “harmony,”
133
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,720
so any autumn grass would
go perfectly with them.
134
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,540
So? Do I look as nice
as the cosmos flowers?
135
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,240
Say, say, am I cute?
136
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,440
Uh…yeah.
137
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,610
Say. What’s with the pause?
138
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,280
You look like you’re having
so much fun.
139
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,790
Billboard Brow!
140
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,460
You’ve recently reached
adolescence, haven’t you?
141
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,500
Don’t get too full of yourself!
142
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,410
Ami!
143
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,880
Sorry! You have such
a beautiful cylinder-shaped body
144
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,710
I mistook you for a vase
and put flowers in you.
145
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,080
Ino!
146
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,620
Shinobi flower aconite.
147
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,260
It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous,
so you’d best spit them out.
148
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,000
Sensei!
149
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,300
Only the root is poisonous, though.
150
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,610
Ino is great.
151
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,810
She knows everything,
is stylish, and is cute.
152
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,620
Even that shuriken skill.
153
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,720
Her Ninjutsu is great, too…
154
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,620
Compared to that, I…
155
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,130
Sakura?
156
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,630
If you’re a cosmos flower…
157
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,300
then am I a thoroughwort?
158
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,610
What’re you saying?!
159
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,580
What?
160
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,110
Let me see…
161
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,480
In a manner of speaking,
you are not a flower, but still a bud!
162
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,590
You’re right.
163
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,710
At this point in time…
164
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,750
I don’t even plan to fight
over Sasuke with you.
165
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,610
What did you say?
166
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,620
You and Sasuke don’t go together,
and I’m totally stronger than you!
167
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,460
You are beneath my notice!
168
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,660
Sakura! Do you know who
you’re lipping off to?!
169
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,230
Don’t press your luck, crybaby Sakura!
169.01	01:14:49:11	01:14:50:24	I feel like...
170
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,610
I feel like Sakura
was out of line!
171
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,770
Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.
She’s scary.
172
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,450
Hmm. That's not it...
173
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,080
Huh?
174
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,620
Sakura’s not the kind of
kid to do things
175
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,090
like needlessly flaunt her
own power and hurt people.
176
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,960
She doesn’t like having Ino
taking pity on her and pulling punches.
177
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,630
I’m a bud, huh…?
178
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,630
Say, Ino…
179
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,600
What?
180
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,540
Why…did you give this ribbon to me?
181
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,810
Actually…
182
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,450
I thought it’d be a waste for
you to wilt away as a bud.
183
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,630
There’s no point if flowers don’t bloom.
184
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,510
For all we know…
185
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,680
it just might...
186
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,490
become a flower
more beautiful than a cosmos.
187
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,670
Thank you...
188
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,770
Ino!
189
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,710
Okay Sakura.
Let’s hurry and go pick flowers.
190
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,380
O-Okay.
191
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,620
What’s wrong, Sakura?
192
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,150
I got some dirt in
my eye when I fell…
193
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,120
You’re so clumsy.
194
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,630
Ino…
195
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,600
All along, I believed in the
words you gave me then.
196
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,670
I really thought that it would
be nice if it were so.
197
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,610
It would be nice if I could get
a beautiful flower to bloom…
198
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:21,080
I set my sights on you because
I wanted to be like you all along.
199
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,290
Thanks to that, I’m here now.
200
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,630
So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.
201
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,670
If I can’t surpass you at your
most serious, there’s no point.
202
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,570
W-What’s with Sakura?
203
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,040
Hmm.
204
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,680
Why are those two getting that heated?!
205
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,180
Alas, he doesn’t even understand
the reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.
206
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,620
Well, a rival is a mysterious thing,
is the point.
207
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,290
Huh?
208
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, hi…
209
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,230
My rival from youth, Kakashi…
210
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,610
Oh, how hip and galling that
nonsensical reaction is.
211
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,080
I…
212
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,380
got on the same team as Sasuke.
213
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,620
Why are you telling me now…?
214
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,020
I won’t lose to you anymore, Ino.
215
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,660
No matter what happens,
I won’t lose to you either, Sakura!
216
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
The ribbon…
217
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,270
I’m giving back the ribbon.
218
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,820
I gave you that ribbon.
219
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,550
Besides, a headband is something
you put on your head, right?
220
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,330
From here on, I’m no longer
a girl who will run after you, Ino.
221
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,630
When I put this on my head,
222
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,070
it will be as a female Shinobi
who can’t lose to you.
223
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,610
That’s a good idea…
224
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,660
Me, too…
225
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,990
until that time.
226
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,070
I understand…Sakura.
227
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,450
– This time for sure...
– This time for sure...
228
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,620
– with full strength…
– with full strength…
229
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,630
– a fair…fight!
– a fair…fight!
230
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,890
Hey, can you hear it?
231
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,470
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
232
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:39,940
The ocean spans limitlessly
233
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,320
Please keep that smile on your face forever
234
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,260
Or else I’ll cry
235
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,030
You won't have to search around you
236
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,670
It’s all ok now.
237
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:11,610
Everyone is inside
this hand
238
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,080
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
239
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,620
When you forget what happiness is
240
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,460
Just sing.
241
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,690
Light is born, and darkness was born
242
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,030
The two are one
243
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,500
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
244
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,010
Hey, can you hear it?
245
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,420
Since when did she get this strong?!
246
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,880
Sure enough, Ino’s great.
247
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,620
But I won’t lose.
I absolutely will not lose.
248
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,620
It can’t be. She’s evenly
matched with me now?!
249
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,090
I’m not who I used to be.
250
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,060
– The next hit is the decisive blow!
– The next hit is the decisive blow!
251
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,300
Next episode:
“The Ultimate Battle: Cha!”
252
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,170
I cannot concede this battle,
even if it’s the last thing I do!
//%
1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:09,750
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:18,000
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,290
One more time
4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,000
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,540
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,250
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,920
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,540
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:54,790
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:02,870
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,870
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,870
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,870
One more time
15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,790
Hey! Geez.
16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,750
Hey, Pervy Sage!
17
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,630
Weren’t you going to
watch my training?!
18
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,870
I’m researching now.
19
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,420
Do it yourself!
20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,080
All right, then I’ll summon a frog,
a frog so big you’ll be shocked!
21
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,210
The Summoning Jutsu!
22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,290
Hmm? What’s wrong?
Did a frog appear?
23
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,500
W-Wait a minute!
24
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,630
What part of that’s a frog?!
25
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,040
If you don’t get serious,
I won’t help you!
26
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,540
Shut up! I am being serious!
27
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,290
Then somehow find your Chakra
as if your life depended on it!
28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,380
That’s what I’m doing!
29
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,380
Huh?!
30
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,870
Sasuke…
31
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,920
Hey Sakura!
32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,830
Huh?!
33
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,790
Sakura! It’s about time you wake
and help me over here!
34
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,670
I’m not sleeping!
I’m busy right now!
35
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,670
Yes, yes…
Then when won’t you be busy?
36
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,460
Later!
37
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,870
I can’t believe it… Geez!
38
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:11,330
A Feeling of Yearning,
A Flower Full of Hope
39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,870
Some of you have probably
already heard but…
40
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,170
Gekko Hayate’s corpse was
found near Kikyo Castle…
41
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,130
What… Hayate?
42
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,500
No way…
43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,870
That’s ridiculous!
44
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,210
Is the opponent Orochimaru?
45
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,500
No…we shouldn’t jump to
that conclusion so easily.
46
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,130
The one Hayate was following
was likely a Sound spy called Kabuto…
47
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,500
Well, it’s certain that Orochimaru
is trying to do something but…
48
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,920
So…we’ll cancel Chunin Exam
and go after Orochimaru…?!
49
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,040
No, he revealed his identity to Anko…
50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,870
sending us a threat not to cancel.
51
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,870
Not to cancel the Chunin Exam
52
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
for which all of the Ninja of
the Alliance have gathered!
53
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,960
What does it mean?
54
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,500
Orochimaru possesses enough power
to take down a small Land on his own.
55
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,920
He’s a Ninja that probably
every land has eyes on.
56
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,130
Moreover, he conveniently holds
a grudge
57
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,870
against this Village Hidden
in the Leaves.
58
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,580
Any Land would desire him.
59
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,870
So could it be…
60
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,290
that any Land in the Alliance
would unite with Orochimaru
61
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,250
and betray the Village Hidden
in the Leaves?!
62
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,880
Well, the Alliance Treaty is at
the same level as a verbal agreement!
63
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,870
As was in the former Great Ninja War…
64
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,290
In any case,
65
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,790
there’s too little information
right now.
66
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,080
Let’s end these unnecessary
suspicions.
67
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,290
We’ve already dispatched Anbu,
68
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,710
the black ops to each Land
to collect information.
69
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,250
It’s dangerous to act carelessly…
70
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,460
That could be what the enemy
is aiming for.
71
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,750
And also…
72
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,870
I trust all of you!
73
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,870
When the time comes,
74
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,830
we’ll bring all the powers of Hidden Leaf
Village together and simply fight!
75
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,330
At that time…
76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,210
Be quiet about this bruise!
77
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,710
Should I have stopped him forcefully…?
78
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,960
No visitors…?
79
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,870
That’s correct.
I’m sorry but…
80
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,870
I know he’s been hospitalized,
but no visitors…?!
81
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,250
What’s going on?
82
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,080
We’re also not aware of the details so…
83
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,210
There’s no use worrying about it here.
84
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,170
Huh?
85
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,830
Should I bring get-well flowers?
86
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,920
So pretty.
87
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,960
Oh no!
88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,670
Oh… How unusual for you to come
by to buy our flowers.
89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,920
N-Not really!
Why would you care?
90
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,460
Besides, isn’t it unusual that
you’re minding the shop?
91
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,080
I’ll choose quickly.
92
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,870
People don’t like flowers with
roots when they’re in the hospital
93
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,870
since they don’t want to
be “rooted” in the hospital…
94
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,630
So cut flowers are fundamental.
95
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,630
W-What are you talking about…?
96
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,330
Playing dumb won’t work.
97
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,080
You’re going to see Sasuke, right?
98
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,630
Mom! I’m going out for a bit!
99
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,870
I-Ino?!
100
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,830
I won’t let you be the first to visit!
I’m going with you!
101
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,380
A get-well visit!
102
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
Shucks… Ino pig!
103
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,380
I’m taking this flower…
104
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,710
One “rose” of love!
105
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,210
That’s so cliché…
106
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,790
Then I’ll make mine this.
“Narcissus”!
107
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,540
A noble flower that doesn’t
succumb to the cold of the winter,
108
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,250
but hopes for the spring and
waits with dignified presence…
109
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,880
with the wish for release from
the hospital as soon as possible.
110
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,790
You’ve gotten pretty knowledgeable.
111
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,790
I told you I wouldn’t lose to you!
112
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, yes yes, so one narcissus, right?
113
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,870
Uh… I need two.
114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,750
Why? One is fine.
115
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,130
No… One for Lee too.
116
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,540
More please!
117
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,460
– Huh?! 					– Huh?
118
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,920
Ten orders of kalbi!
119
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,080
You sure can eat.
Just watching you makes me feel ill.
120
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,880
Here you are!
121
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,870
It’s here!
122
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,870
This is mine, all right?
Don’t eat any of it, Shikamaru!
123
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,130
I won’t eat any!
124
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,380
What’s going on with you guys,
barbecue in the middle of the day?
125
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,420
– Oh…? 					– Huh?
126
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,000
Ino and Sakura…
127
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,540
Shikamaru, shouldn’t you be going through
some special training or something
128
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,870
to prepare for the final exam?
129
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,080
I am…
130
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,880
Every single day…
131
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,670
Asuma is so persistent.
132
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,670
Actually, Choji’s been joining us
in the special training.
133
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,080
Really?
134
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,250
So you took it on?
135
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,580
Yup! In exchange, he’s treating me
to as much barbecue as I can eat!
136
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,420
I see…
137
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,040
Oh, I shouldn’t have held on
for the Final Round.
138
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,870
Don’t be ridiculous!
139
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,870
There are numerous people who
want to participate, but can’t!
140
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
That’s right!
141
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,210
From what I’ve heard,
142
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,670
they’re doing some awfully
difficult things
143
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,380
over at Guy and Kurenai’s team!
144
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,460
W-What’s that?
145
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,630
Even though we’ve made
it this far,
146
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,130
to get totally thrashed
wouldn’t be very cool…
147
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,420
Aw man, what a drag…
148
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,790
Whatever the circumstances,
149
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,830
we’ve exceeded
a human being’s limits.
150
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,250
So I’ve used too much Chakra…
151
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,460
Neji, are you all right?!
152
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,870
Summoning Jutsu!
153
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
What?! A tadpole again?!
154
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,880
You haven’t made
any progress whatsoever!
155
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,380
See how it’s bigger
than the ones earlier?!
156
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,580
How the heck should I know?!
157
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,150
So you want to see Sasuke Uchiha…?
158
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,960
Just five minutes.
159
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,710
I can’t allow you to visit
any longer than that.
160
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,830
His body still needs to rest…
161
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes…
162
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,870
Sasuke. You have visitors…
163
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,790
Two cute young ladies…
164
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,750
Oh…!
165
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,630
– Huh? 					– Huh?
166
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,750
Sasuke, Sasuke?
167
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,500
His clothes are gone!
168
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,290
– What?! 					– What?
169
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,580
It’s terrible! He’s in no condition
to be walking outside yet!
170
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,870
Doctor! Doctor!
171
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,380
Sasuke…
172
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,420
No way…
173
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,170
Sasuke will, without
a doubt, desire me…
174
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,040
Sasuke… Where in the world
have you gone…?
175
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,170
Could cliff-climbing be so taxing…?
176
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,870
Damn, my body is sluggish…
177
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,880
Will I make it in time…?
178
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,000
Open!
179
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,290
Huh?
180
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,870
Yo!
181
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,540
Huh… You finally made it here…
182
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,920
We’ll search for Sasuke
on our end.
183
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,080
But if you happen to see him,
please contact us.
184
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,170
– We will. 					– Yes.
185
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,750
And also…you wanted to see Lee, right?
186
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,630
– Yes. 					– Yes.
187
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,630
He’s also in no condition to move,
so please make your visit brief.
188
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,040
Lee, you have visitors.
189
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,420
Two cute young ladies…
190
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,670
Oh?!
191
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,580
– Huh?! 					– Huh?!
192
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,870
Really… even Lee!
193
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,000
Lee! Lee!
194
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,290
Lee…
195
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,330
Huh?
196
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,870
Look!
197
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,870
Huh?
198
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,380
Lee…?!
199
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,170
Sakura, let’s go!
200
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,460
Okay!
201
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,960
200 one-armed pushups…
202
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,580
If I can’t do them,
100 one-legged squats…
203
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,710
190…!
204
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,750
Lee! Stop it! 					Lee! Stop it!
205
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,870
191…
206
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,880
Lee!
207
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,420
Please don’t touch me!
208
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,420
Don’t…interfere…
with my training…
209
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,380
I need two…
210
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,920
Why? One is fine.
211
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,630
No… One for Lee too…
212
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,630
Speaking of which, Sakura,
did you hear about that Lee?
213
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,750
What? Hear what?
214
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,870
Well, that Lee…
215
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,790
his injuries were serious and
he can no longer…
216
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,960
continue as a Shinobi.
217
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,870
195…
218
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,330
196…
219
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,710
197…
220
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,870
198…
221
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,210
I’m…not finished…yet!
222
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,500
There’s no value in making
an effort for someone
223
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,500
who doesn’t believe in himself!
224
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,870
One…one hundred…ninety…nine…
225
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,870
One… One more…
226
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,170
One more time…!
227
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,460
– Huh?! 					– Oh!
228
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,170
Lee…!
229
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,830
I’ll…go get the stretcher.
230
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,960
Please keep an eye on him.
231
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.
232
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,420
Hey…lno…
233
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,830
Huh?
234
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,000
Why do boys…
have to push themselves?
235
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,420
Don’t ask me that.
I’m a girl you know!
236
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,130
Sorry…
237
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,750
The Human…Boulder!
238
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,920
Ninja Art: Shadow Possession Ju…!
239
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,870
Darn it, I don’t have enough Chakra!
240
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,080
What’s the matter, Shikamaru?!
241
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,710
Have you hit your limit already?
242
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,710
Man! What a drag…
243
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,130
All right, Choji!
One more time!
244
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,250
Who brought that…?
245
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,670
The rose I went to the trouble
of bringing was a waste.
246
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,170
My narcissus too…
247
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,870
Oh… How boring.
248
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,870
Hey, Naruto!
249
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,580
The swimsuit gals have gone,
so why don’t we call it a day?
250
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,870
What? Let’s stay a little longer!
251
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,130
Come on, a little longer…
Just a little longer!
252
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,580
I’m hungry. And I’m pretty tired too.
253
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,460
You haven’t even done anything.
254
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,040
You should be thankful
I hung out with you!
255
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,000
He’s getting ticked off at me.
256
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,170
All right, I got it… Sexy Jutsu!
257
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,380
Oh!
258
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,880
What, that’s it?
259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,830
What I want to do isn’t the Sexy Jutsu,
but Summoning Jutsu!
260
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,670
All right, all right…
Then try it out.
261
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,210
Here goes--!
262
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,380
Summoning…Jutsu!
263
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,290
I did it!
264
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,290
You should die!
You have no talent!
265
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,870
Take a careful look!
266
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,670
Huh?
267
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,000
See, it has rear legs!
268
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,000
You idiot! Conjure one up with
hands, feet and ears!
269
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,960
Shut your mouth!
Having legs is better than before!
270
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,870
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
271
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,170
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
272
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,790
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
273
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,920
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
274
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,460
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
275
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,830
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
276
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,670
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
277
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,880
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
278
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,330
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
279
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,750
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
280
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:23,870
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
281
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:31,290
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
282
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,870
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
283
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
284
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,330
Ichiraku's ramen is
as good as usual!
285
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,460
If the training continues like this,
I don't mind doing it forever!
286
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,580
Eat, keeping eating more because
this will be the last…
287
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,870
What? Did you say something?
288
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,870
Do you like the food?
289
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,870
Hey master, one more bowl
of ramen please!
290
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,920
Good. Just keep eating away so
you'll have no regrets about your life.
291
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,710
Next time, "Live or Die:
Risk it All to Win it All!"
292
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,920
Is this sage hiding something from me?
//%
1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,180
One more time
4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,840
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:45,430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,680
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,840
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
One more time
15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,510
Sakura!
16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,600
It was worth teaching you Genjutsu
in survival training
17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,300
during the Genin Exam.
18
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,840
You truly have a talent for it.
19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,050
Huh?
20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,970
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,140
Naruto will be delighted.
22
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,720
He’ll be getting a mission
after such a long while.
23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,350
What do you mean by a mission?
24
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,640
Be careful…
25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,390
It’s the first A-Ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.
26
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,350
Village in Distress:
A New A-Ranked Mission!
27
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,840
Sensei! What do you mean by A-Ranked
mission in the condition we are in?!
28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,510
What do we have to do?!
29
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,840
Sasuke is chasing Gaara and company
of the Sand Village.
30
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,260
Sakura…
31
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,840
Release the Genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru,
32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,640
and go after Sasuke.
33
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,970
I feel uneasy…
about that unusual Chakra.
34
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,640
But then,
35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,850
we should wake up Ino and Choji
and go in a large group.
36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,260
There may already
be quite a large number
37
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,840
of Sand and Sound Shinobi
who have infiltrated this village.
38
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,220
Actions lose quickness when there’s more
than the fundamental four in a squad…
39
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,840
and it becomes difficult to
hide from the enemy.
40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,890
You learned that in the Academy's
patrol practical training, right?
41
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,840
Oh, I see! Then four means
that you’ll come with us…
42
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
No, I must not leave here.
43
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,350
Summoning Jutsu!
44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,840
As for the rest, this Pakkun will
track down Sasuke by scent!
45
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,220
C-Could it be…
the one other member is this puppy?!
46
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,390
Hey! Little girl!
Don’t you be calling me a cute puppy!
47
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,850
I didn’t say…cute.
48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,300
Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru!
49
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,680
Okay!
50
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,100
Release!
51
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
What is it…Sakura?
52
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,600
Get down!
53
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,390
I’ll tell you later!
Just stay down!
54
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,760
Shikamaru…you were…
from the beginning…
55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,390
Owwee!
56
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,010
You were able to release Genjutsu, too!
57
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!
58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,550
Humph! I don’t want to
end up getting involved!
59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,050
Heck no…
I could care less about Sasuke!
60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,180
Owwee!
61
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,470
W-What's going on…?
62
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Naruto! Behind you!
63
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,840
F-Fast…
64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,510
Not just fast…
65
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,930
Guy Sensei!
66
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,300
Now, I’ll announce the mission!
67
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,720
As soon as you’ve heard what
the mission is, go through that hole.
68
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,850
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!
69
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,930
Then await next orders
in a safe place.
70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,970
Huh? Did something happen
to Sasuke?!
71
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,010
I’ll tell you the reason en route!
72
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,840
Let’s go!
73
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Jeez… Why me?
74
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,390
Hey, boy!
75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,430
Huh…?
76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
If this mission is a success,
77
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
as a reward I’ll let you
touch my paw-pads.
78
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,720
So don’t sulk like that!
79
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,640
Huh?
80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
See?
81
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,100
They’re soft and supple!
82
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,970
Su..pple…?
83
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,840
Yes, very…
84
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,430
Soft and Supple!
85
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,840
Let’s just go!
86
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,050
H-Hey!
87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,390
Will it be okay with just them?
88
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,140
They’ll be okay.
Pakkun is with them.
89
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,510
As long as they don’t pursue too far…
90
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
To think I’d be able to fight you again…
91
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,260
This barrier can’t be broken
unless it’s from the inside.
92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,140
If Lord Hokage would just
take out one of those four,
93
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,640
we could help…
94
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,300
Hey, it’s gonna start soon.
95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,970
Put up a barrier on the inside, too!
96
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,350
Sure!
97
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,010
Hm… It doesn’t look like
I’ll be able to get out this easily.
98
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,050
You don’t really mean that.
99
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,600
It’d be tougher for you if someone
came in and got in the way, right?
100
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken!
101
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
That’s too easy!
102
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,140
Striking Shadow Snake!
103
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,300
With such a weak technique…
104
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,840
It sucks to get old, eh,
Sarutobi Sensei?
105
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,640
Substitution?!
106
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,180
Earth Style: Great Mud River!
107
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,180
Is this it?
108
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,840
I don’t think so!
109
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,220
Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb!
110
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,430
Fire Dragon Bomb!
111
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,550
He’s combined Earth and Fire!
112
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,550
Excellent, Lord Hokage!
113
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,220
Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru.
114
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,600
Very good…
115
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,050
Really, I’ve been grossly underestimated.
116
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,140
Did you think you could kill me
with that level of Jutsu?
117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,840
Humph… A hateful fellow as usual!
118
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,140
Don’t say that.
119
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,430
A high maintenance student is cute.
Right, Sarutobi Sensei?
120
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,430
Something’s strange…
121
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,140
All of the Academy’s classes
doing self-study.
122
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
And that smoke…
123
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,840
That's coming from the direction
of the exam arena.
124
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,840
Isn't there some disturbance
to the east?
125
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,840
I wonder if something happened…
126
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,840
This is definitely strange!
127
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,300
But sudden self-study is
sure a smack in the eye!
128
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,470
It’s been like this for a while!
129
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,970
Yeah. Iruka Sensei
and everyone are late…
130
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,260
Aren’t they, Konohamaru?
131
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,840
Konohamaru?
132
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,430
Yikes!
133
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,640
Jeez, what is this?!
134
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,760
And Mom just bought this for me!
135
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,550
I’ll loan you my colored pencil.
136
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,840
What’re you saying?!
This color is this spring’s new color!
137
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,390
Aww, what'll I do?
138
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,840
That is…?
139
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,260
I wonder if Naruto and the others
went to stop Sasuke?
140
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,930
Those brats?
141
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,680
But surely, some Genin won’t
be able to make any difference…
142
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,510
Hm? Is this the data of
that kid back there?
143
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,180
You give him too much credit.
144
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,100
Think again!
145
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,890
You’ll trip up if you underestimate him.
146
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,100
Teachers' Office
147
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,840
There is information that several units
have already infiltrated the village…!
148
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,010
We should evacuate the students
to a safe place right away!
149
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,800
Yes… And without causing panic
among the students!
150
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,840
Then let’s evacuate the students
151
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,850
as soon as possible under
the pretense of an evacuation drill!
152
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,890
Isn’t it about time
we stopped playing around?
153
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,890
This isn’t an Academy class, so…
154
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,510
You have a point.
155
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,600
Did you foresee your final moments?
156
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,840
I won’t go easy on you
just because you’re doddering.
157
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,100
I look forward to it.
158
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,550
Depending on your Jutsu,
159
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,100
I might have to have you
start over at the Academy!
160
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,930
Please don’t disappoint me too much!
161
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
W-Wow…
162
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,840
What Chakra?!
163
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,930
Yeah… It seems the air is
bearing down within the body!
164
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,720
Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!
165
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,840
Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation!
166
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,010
That technique!
167
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,180
One!
168
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
He is using a Summoning Jutsu
as a shield.
169
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,140
And this dead person is…
170
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,220
Two!
171
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,680
I must stop the third one at any cost…!
172
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,840
Three!
173
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,140
It looks like the third one was no good.
Oh well…
174
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,840
It looks like I stopped the third one.
175
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,100
Now, this is where it gets tough…
176
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,220
He summoned those two of all people…
177
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,840
I-It can’t be!
Those personages are…!
178
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,050
Those personages are?
179
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,220
Now, what will you do,
Sarutobi Sensei…?
180
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,760
No…
181
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,760
Lord…Third Hokage.
182
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,350
Okay! Everyone, please move quickly!
183
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,890
Oh, what a day!
184
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,390
My favorite colored pencil
didn’t have to break like that!
185
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,840
Lousy evacuation drill…
Self-study was better.
186
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,100
Konohamaru’s been quiet, hasn’t he?
I wonder what’s wrong?
187
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,890
Huh? Yeah.
188
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,180
After the whole school does
a long self-study,
189
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,010
the whole school does
an evacuation drill.
190
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,140
This is too strange!
191
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,840
Okay! Stop! Get in line!
192
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,600
That look on Iruka Sensei’s face…
193
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,840
Something’s definitely going on here!
194
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,680
And also…
195
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,760
Okay, everyone!
Don’t go off on your own.
196
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,300
That rainbow… It's been
bugging me for a while!
197
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,840
What’s that, Old Man?
There’s a strange rainbow!
198
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,140
It’s an unusual rainbow!
199
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,430
Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?
200
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,680
Yeah! And I’ve never seen
such a pretty rainbow!
201
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,220
I see, I see.
But, Konohamaru…
202
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,390
Hmm?
203
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,850
Rainbows used to symbolize snakes…
204
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,180
And it’s said that they bode evil.
205
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,050
Such a pretty thing? That’s a lie!
206
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,100
I see, I see.
207
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,930
Symbolizes snakes…
ls something happening?
208
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,930
Long time no see…Saru.
209
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,550
Oh, it’s you…
You’ve gotten old, Sarutobi.
210
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,720
I never thought I would meet
the great brothers in this manner…
211
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,260
It’s regretful.
212
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,890
This is bad.
213
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,850
That Summoning Jutsu…
214
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Who in the world are they?!
215
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,470
Please prepare yourselves…
216
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,930
Lord First Hokage…
217
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,930
Lord Second Hokage!
218
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,350
That’s right…
219
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
The one with the black hair
is the First Hokage.
220
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,050
The one with the white hair
is the Second Hokage.
221
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,890
They are both reputed to
be the highest Shinobi
222
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,890
and they are the Hokages
who built the today’s Leaf Village!
223
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,510
Reanimation, huh?
224
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,050
This youth summoned us with
the Forbidden Jutsu, then?
225
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,970
He’s something else…
226
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,850
Then, Sarutobi!
227
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,050
Does this mean we must…fight you?
228
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,430
Let’s stop the old people
get-together talk…
229
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,470
Shall we get started?
230
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,890
There’s always fighting…
no matter when you live.
231
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,050
You like that, don’t you?
232
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,970
No good will come by deriding the dead
and playing around with time!
233
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,840
I get it! So that’s what happened!
234
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,600
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
235
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,760
So, why am I pulled into this?!
This is such a drag!
236
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,300
It can’t be helped!
lt’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.
237
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,930
This way!
238
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,640
That brat, huh…
239
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,760
Let’s go!
240
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:27,970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
241
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:39,300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
242
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump
243
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you
244
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught
245
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
246
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
247
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:31,640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile
248
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:42,180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on
249
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,840
Forge on strong
250
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Darn it! The pursuer is too fast!
251
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,260
Once we Genin get caught,
that will be the end.
252
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,840
In that case,
we should ambush and attack them.
253
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,850
I already thought of it,
but it’ll probably be no use.
254
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,140
Then, what should we do?!
255
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,680
There is only one choice.
256
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,930
Next time, “A Shirker’s Call to Action:
Layabout No More!”
257
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,180
It isn’t my style,
but we have no choice, I guess.

Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,480
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,310
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,600
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:58,270
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,890
The same Jutsu as me?!
23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,020
Why have you shown up too?
24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,350
Well…I asked you to take care
of them earlier.
25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,560
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,150
What business does
a Rogue Ninja like you
27
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,770
have in this village now?
28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,150
Kakashi Hatake…
29
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,890
Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan
30
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,520
What?! Why?! Why?!
31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,940
Why do I have to go on a research trip
with you, Pervy Sage?
32
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,890
Oh no, this isn’t just any research trip.
33
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,980
There’s a woman whose data
I want to collect.
34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,650
So we have to look for her first.
35
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,690
I really don’t have time to accompany you
on your perverted research trip!
36
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,730
Because I have training!
37
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,600
Hm? Training?
38
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,770
I will take lessons from Kakashi Sensei
and learn a variety of things, like Chidori!
39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
Kakashi Sensei has been
playing favorites lately!
40
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,480
Well, I think that technique
is impossible for you to learn.
41
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,890
More importantly…
That woman is really beautiful.
42
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,190
You want to meet her, don’t you?!
43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Not at all.
44
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,850
I’m not some kid who can
be cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!
45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,810
Anyway, no!
46
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,900
Well, it can’t be helped…
47
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,060
Oh, well… I know Jutsu more amazing
than Chidori, but…
48
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,890
It can’t be helped…
Maybe I’ll take Sasuke?
49
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,100
Of course I’ll go!
50
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,100
I’ll pack my bags right away.
51
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,440
Pervy Sage, don’t move!
52
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,150
I’ll be darned… He’s really a cute kid.
53
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,100
Those eyes are exactly the same
as they used to be in the past.
54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,230
That being said,
he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan…
55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,270
I have to assume the worst-case scenario,
just in case.
56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,150
This is a surprise…
No wonder you copied my Jutsu…
57
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,310
So there really is a fellow
besides Itachi who has that eye.
58
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,940
Your name is Kakashi,
the Copy Ninja, wasn’t it?
59
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,850
I’m the one who was surprised.
60
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,650
I saw strange men in the tea house
and wondered who they were…
61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,890
There they were Itachi Uchiha and…
62
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,190
the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village,
Kisame Hoshigaki.
63
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,270
Well, well… You know even my name.
lt’s an honor.
64
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,150
I see. You’re one of the
“Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.”
65
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,350
That huge sword is the “Shark Skin,” right?
66
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,810
I heard that kid Zabuza
had it out with you?
67
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,770
Yeah…
68
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,770
You are someone who’s
well worth lopping off…
69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,810
Stop it… Kisame.
70
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,600
If you were to go at it with that man,
it won’t end without cost.
71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,890
And if you spend too much time,
another Shinobi would come running.
72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,940
However…
73
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,890
Don’t lose sight of the goal…
You didn’t come here to get injured!
74
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,150
Let me hear that “goal” then…?
75
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,350
Just came to find something
we’re looking for.
76
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,900
Something you’re looking for?
77
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,100
The thing you’re looking for…
What is it?
78
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,020
I’m different from Kisame,
I won’t take time.
79
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,730
Ninja Art: Water Style.
Water wall!
80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,060
That’s some Jutsu speed.
My eyes couldn’t follow the Sign.
81
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,020
That Shuriken in the right hand
was a decoy…
82
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,900
to use a Water Style Jutsu to launch
an attack below my foot …
83
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,690
That’s what to expect from you, Kakashi.
84
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,940
Your power of analytical eye…is great.
85
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,650
A Shadow Clone?!
His Jutsu speed is too fast!
86
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,940
A water clone?!
87
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,060
The Copy Ninja has done well this far
with Jutsu of my village.
88
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,940
Nice! Kakashi!
89
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,600
Get down, Kurenai!
90
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,560
This one is the Shadow Clone…
91
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,060
Huh?
92
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,020
Kakashi! Kurenai!
93
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,020
He made the Shadow Clone
body explode?!
94
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,980
A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.
95
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,940
Sakura’s going to start to like me…
96
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,890
Maybe!
97
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,890
Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke
will be surprised!
98
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,890
Kakashi…!
99
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,980
Don’t lower your guard…
100
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,690
He’s the guy who became a division chief
of Anbu Black Ops at 13 years old…
101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,980
To think he’s this powerful…
102
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,230
No, you haven’t seen
this guy’s strength yet.
103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,650
I didn’t expect that you who are not
a member of the Uchiha clan
104
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,270
would have mastered
the Sharingan to that extent…
105
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,310
But your body isn’t the “Uchiha clan” body
that goes with the eye.
106
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,400
That’s right. As a result,
my stamina doesn't last…
107
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,520
There’s a reason why the Uchiha Clan
was deemed the strongest and feared…
108
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,980
I’ll demonstrate the true strength
of Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!
109
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,270
I-It can’t be!
110
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,890
This is bad!
111
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,350
Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!
112
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,890
Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!
113
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,900
Both of you,
absolutely do not open your eyes…
114
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,310
It’s all over now if your eyes meet.
115
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,190
Only people with Sharingan
can have a go with that technique.
116
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,890
Indeed with Sharingan,
117
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,400
you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan
to a certain extent.
118
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,480
However…
119
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,890
this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,
120
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,890
Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm,
is unbreakable.
121
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,060
The only person who can bring me down
is someone
122
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,890
using the same Kekkei Genkai,
a Sharingan user…
123
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,890
Sasuke…
124
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,730
I wonder how much you can take
without the Kekkei Genkai?
125
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,770
The one just now was…Genjutsu?
126
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,890
In the world of Tsukuyomi…
127
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,890
Both space and time…
128
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,560
and mass…
I control them all.
129
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
For the next 72 hours…
130
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,890
I’ll stab you continually with swords.
131
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,150
That’s…
132
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,890
In the world of Tsukuyomi…
133
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,310
Both space and time…
134
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,020
and mass…
I control them all.
135
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,150
Calm down… This is Genjutsu.
136
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,900
It’s best not to be optimistic
and think it’s an illusion.
137
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,100
This pain is not an illusion.
138
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,890
This pain is absolutely
no different from reality.
139
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,940
How long will your spirit sustain?
140
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,770
There’s…
71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left.
141
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,940
Wha…?!
142
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,730
S-Since then…?!
143
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,350
That’s all the time that has passed?!
144
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,270
What happened, Kakashi?!
145
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,020
Are you saying we should keep
our eyes closed still?!
146
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,690
N-Not…yet…
147
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,770
What happened?!
148
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,310
Just as that guy finished speaking,
you suddenly fell over!
149
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,440
Three days in that world is less than
a moment in the actual world, huh…
150
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,440
But…why doesn’t he kill me?
151
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,650
He could easily do so, if he wants to…
152
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,980
Whoa…To take that Jutsu without causing
his spirit to collapse.
153
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,900
But Itachi…
154
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,940
it’s also dangerous for you
to overuse those eyes.
155
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,940
The thing you’re looking for…
156
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,060
is it Sasuke?
157
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,980
No…the legacy of the Fourth Hokage…
158
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,020
These guys.
What the heck are they planning…?
159
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,440
So, Naruto, is it…?
160
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,600
It’s been a long time…
161
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,940
How many years has it been
since you returned to the village?
162
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,980
Kakashi…
163
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,850
I will keep Naruto under my care.
164
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,770
It was an understandable decision
of the Third Hokage
165
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,310
who appointed you to
the role of watching over Naruto…
166
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,310
But even at your level,
you may not be able to handle it properly.
167
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,850
What in the world are you saying?
168
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,690
I’ve been observing Orochimaru
ever since he left the village…
169
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,350
It was obvious that he would return
to this village sooner or later.
170
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,400
All told, at first I was concerned
only about him, but…
171
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,310
What is it?
172
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,890
The guy joined an organization.
173
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,100
An organization?
174
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,890
What are the details of the organization?
175
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,890
I don’t know much of the details,
176
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,230
but it’s a small organization known
as Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.
177
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,600
Until recently, they weren’t making
any dramatic moves
178
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,850
except some cloak-and-dagger activities.
179
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,890
The biggest concern is
the members of that organization.
180
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,190
Almost all of them are listed
on the Bingo Book,
181
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,190
all S-rank deviant criminals.
182
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,060
That Itachi is among them.
183
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,520
If the nine of them get together,
their intent will not be volunteer activities.
184
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,900
Since you’ve been told this much,
you already know what it means.
185
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,520
But recently, Orochimaru pulled out
of the organization.
186
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,770
And at that time,
187
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,890
other members of the organization
went in to action in different areas,
188
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,150
in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.
189
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,650
Is there proof that one of those
things is the Nine-Tailed Fox?
190
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,900
It’s possible.
191
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,890
Because it’s one of the spirits
who possess the strongest Chakra…
192
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Kakashi…
193
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,900
Sooner or later, that Naruto will have
to live watching his back…
194
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,890
That’s his destiny.
195
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,350
For now, you should keep
your eyes on Sasuke.
196
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,270
It’s necessary for you to teach him
how to use his Sharingan.
197
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,020
I’ll take care of Naruto for a while.
198
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,400
The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto
is your target?
199
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,850
I know that you two aren’t
the only ones on the move…
200
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,440
The name of your organization is
Akatsuki, right?
201
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,520
Akatsuki?
202
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,020
Kisame! We’ll take Kakashi.
Erase the other two.
203
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,560
Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
204
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,230
Who are you?
205
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,890
The Leaf’s noble, blue fierce animal…
206
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,980
Mighty Guy!
207
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,770
What a sight…
Shouldn’t you be called a strange beast?
208
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,900
Don’t underestimate that man…
209
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,940
That man is Itachi!
210
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,900
You did this to Kakashi…?
211
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,560
Don’t look at Itachi’s eyes, Guy!
You’ll be caught up in his Jutsu!
212
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,890
I know that already!
213
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,350
In order to fight Kakashi,
I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.
214
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,890
Open your eyes, both of you!
215
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,560
B-But…
216
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,230
When you battle with the Sharingan,
217
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,440
it’s not a problem if
you don’t look at those eyes!
218
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,400
You work around it by
gaining insight into his movements
219
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
by looking constantly at his feet.
220
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,890
Now that you mention it,
you’re probably right, but…
221
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,730
You’re the only one who can do that.
222
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,890
That’s true…
223
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,100
There’s a knack to reading
224
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,400
all of your opponents’ movements
only by his feet.
225
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,150
But I can’t teach it to you
in this emergency.
226
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,480
Just get used it right now!
227
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,890
What should we do?
228
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,520
Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.
229
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,690
Asuma, you are my back-up!
230
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,520
Okay!
231
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,310
And until the reinforcements of
Anbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,
232
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,770
I will hang out with you guys.
233
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,890
Interesting…
That’s some nerve…
234
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,190
Kisame… Pull the plug.
235
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,600
We didn’t come to have a war.
236
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,730
It’s too bad,
but no more of this nonsense.
237
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,190
We’re leaving.
238
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,730
Too bad… I was finally feeling motivated.
239
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,270
It can’t be helped.
240
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,230
All right!
241
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,890
Here I go!
242
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,890
Y-You’re putting too much spirit into it.
243
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,020
You’re not training on a mountain retreat,
you know that, right?
244
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,890
A cycle of hardship, right?
245
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,850
Inside, we were crying, right?
246
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:40,940
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
247
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,020
It's a secondary role,
248
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,890
a role in the shadows
249
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,230
But in reaching for that dream,
250
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,890
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
251
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,020
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
252
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,980
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
253
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:20,270
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
254
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,690
Over and over,
we've seen fools
255
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,890
There's a super beautiful
young lady over there!
256
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,020
She just winked at us!
257
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,270
Look, Naruto!
She must be interested in us!
258
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,890
She may be cuter than Sakura!
259
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,890
– All right, Naruto!
– Yeah!
260
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,440
Go back, train,
then go to bed.
261
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,810
You always do that to me!
262
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,900
Next time: "Jiraiya:
Naruto's Potential Disaster!"
263
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,890
What are we gonna do
about my training?!
//%
1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,130
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,630
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,260
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,840
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,260
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,260
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,920
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,760
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,050
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,420
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,720
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,300
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,880
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,380
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,010
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,590
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,300
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,720
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,090
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,420
Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!
21
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,300
Oh! Dad!
22
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,090
This isn’t good!
23
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh no, Gamatatsu!
Let’s get out of here!
24
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,460
What? Why, why?
25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,380
It doesn’t matter, just hurry up!
26
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,630
Manda and Orochimaru,
Katsuyu and Tsunade…
27
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,460
They all bring back memories…
28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,460
Shall we have a reunion
or something, Jiraiya?
29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,130
Fool! I summon you after a long absence
30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,460
and you make these boring jokes.
31
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,720
The time to conclude this long,
fateful confrontation has come.
32
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,670
I'm bringing Orochimaru down,
here and now!
33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,170
Hey Orochimaru…
34
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,880
Why'd you have to summon me
to a place like this?!
35
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,090
You… I’m going to eat you up!
36
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,460
Don’t say that, Lord Manda…
37
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,460
You will be duly rewarded.
38
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,460
Who said I'm talking to you?!
39
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,550
Don’t be so flippant, brat!
40
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,460
Hey, Orochimaru…
41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,050
I expect you to prepare
a sacrificial offering of 100 people later.
42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,050
Though Lord Orochimaru is
Manda’s master,
43
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,590
if Manda learns that Lord Orochimaru
can’t use Jutsu,
44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,970
Manda will no doubt
double-cross him.
45
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,460
Despite the fact that he had
no other choice, in his condition,
46
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,010
it was too risky for Lord Orochimaru
to summon Manda.
47
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,630
Katsuyu… take that kid to Shizune!
48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,880
Yes, ma’am.
49
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,800
All right! I can fight, too!
50
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,050
Shizune, please take care of this child.
51
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Naruto…
52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,880
Also, the battle is going to get
quite vicious from now.
53
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,130
Please go far away with my clone
and conceal yourself…
54
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,300
That’s what Lady Tsunade wants.
55
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,340
Lady Tsunade…
56
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,130
You…
57
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,460
I’ll hang you out until you’re dry!
58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,460
I’ve been wanting a snakeskin wallet…
59
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Orochimaru,
you’ve sunk too deeply into vice!
60
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,220
We are no longer comrades.
61
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,720
Comrades?
62
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,550
That word makes me shiver.
63
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,460
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!
64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
Acid Slime!
65
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,590
I’ll start with this one!
66
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,510
Katsuyu!
67
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,670
Lady Tsunade…
68
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
Here they come!
69
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,010
I know!
70
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,880
Tsunade! Stay away!
71
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
Bunta! Give me some oil!
72
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,260
Okay!
73
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,380
Fire Style!
74
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,460
Toad Oil Flamethrower!
75
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,510
Humph… How’s that?
76
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
Did it work?
77
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,260
No, that’s…
78
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,460
Molten skin! He shed his skin!
79
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Bunta! Under the earth!
80
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,800
What?!
81
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,220
It’s the tail?!
82
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,130
Keep it shut!
83
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,260
They're Sannin, all right.
84
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,340
Dealing with two of them is rough.
85
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,800
Tsunade!
86
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,840
Well now, I can kill you
by wringing your neck.
87
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,800
My Chakra…
88
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,470
At this rate…
89
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,920
Even though you say
you won’t die in battle,
90
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,460
you won't have a choice if
I rip your neck off…
91
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,170
Right, Tsunade?
92
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,260
How many minutes…
93
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,300
How many seconds can I hold on…?
94
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,260
I have to put it on the line!
95
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,340
Fine!
96
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,460
It’s about time we put an end to this!
97
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,550
R-Ridiculous!
98
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,010
Not done yet!
99
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,010
Take this!
100
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Darn it…!
101
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,880
Lady Tsunade… Not that…!
102
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,970
She’s reached her limit…
103
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,170
No…
104
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
This guy…
105
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,050
I’ve hurled him around that much,
yet he’s still…
106
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,630
So this is as far as you can go.
107
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,380
Shut up!
108
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,760
Don’t rest!
109
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,880
Keep beating him.
110
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,720
This is the battle…
111
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,090
where I put my life on the line!
112
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,880
Lord Orochimaru!
113
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,590
I won’t let you go!
114
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,420
You will stay with me until the end!
115
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,880
Take this!
116
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,550
I hit him and hit him.
Something’s different…
117
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,630
What is it?
This…strange sense of discomfort?
118
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,550
However, with this…!
119
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,220
It’s over!
120
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,720
He took a direct hit!
121
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,760
That was it.
122
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,970
Yeah…
123
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,920
Lord Orochimaru…
124
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,970
Putting me in this position!
125
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,840
I want to eat you and kill you,
126
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,460
but I can’t even chew you up
with this hole in my mouth…
127
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,260
Next time, if we meet again,
be prepared!
128
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,010
Tsunade…
129
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:32,300
Even though you won’t heal me,
I still have one way.
130
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,460
A way to resurrect these arms.
131
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,460
The Leaf Village…
I’ll destroy it…without fail.
132
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,460
At that time, it would be nice
if we could meet again…
133
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,460
My comrades…
Tsunade and Jiraiya.
134
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,840
That face…?!
135
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,260
In some way or another,
he took someone else’s body…?!
136
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,550
No wonder,
when we went at it a while ago,
137
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,130
I didn’t get the same feeling
from him that I did in the past…
138
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,260
The true elixir of life.
139
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,130
That’s my…
140
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,260
my immortality!
141
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,460
Some day, in the future…
142
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,130
Wait!
143
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,090
The bones in my ribs and feet
are broken…
144
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,050
The side effects of the Jutsu
are starting…
145
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,380
My body is…already…
146
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,630
Tsunade, you haven’t changed.
You’re no good at wagers.
147
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,800
The Hokage is my dream!
148
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,800
I’ll give you one week.
149
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,800
If you can master that Jutsu,
150
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,460
I’ll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage…
151
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,550
and give you this necklace.
152
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,670
It's no joke!
153
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,300
If I have three days,
I’ll master this Jutsu!
154
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,220
Men don’t go back on their word!
155
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,130
I’m the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!
156
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,420
You said it.
Men don’t go back on their word!
157
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Right! I’ll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!
158
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,300
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
159
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,260
I love this village and my comrades.
160
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,590
So I want to protect them.
161
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,090
An existence that protects everyone.
162
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,460
Becoming the Hokage is my dream…
163
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,420
I’d like you… to take this.
164
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,760
Any time now, the side effects…
165
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,460
Lady Tsunade…
166
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,920
You…
167
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,220
It's nothing… If I rest a bit, I’ll return
to my young form.
168
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,470
I’ll rest in town.
169
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,920
And when Naruto wakes up,
We’ll return to Konoha.
170
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
Tsunade…
171
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,340
Starting now, don’t call me Tsunade.
Call me…
172
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,130
The Fifth Hokage?!
173
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,340
Old Lady Tsunade is
the Fifth Hokage starting today…
174
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,340
What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.
175
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,050
After all, compared to the old man,
the Third Hokage,
176
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,010
there’s something…
177
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,920
rough-natured and kind of selfish…
178
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,970
loose with money, catty and stupid…
179
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,590
Somehow, I’m going to worry
if she can do it properly.
180
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,170
Lady Tsunade, would you like
to order something…
181
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,460
Moreover, a 50-year-old lady
transforming into a young lady…
182
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,460
Is it okay for the person who
will become Hokage
183
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,460
to lie to everyone, I wonder…?
184
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,720
Go outside, brat!
185
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,170
It’s just like before…
186
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,630
Despite how I look,
I’m going to be the Fifth Hokage.
187
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,460
I shouldn’t take
this short brat of a foe seriously…
188
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
This one is enough…
189
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,970
Don’t call me brat!
190
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,090
I may be like this now,
but I’ll be Hokage some day!
191
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,050
Here I go!
192
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,380
Another brow flick?!
193
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Become a fine man…
194
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,590
and, a fine Hokage.
195
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,880
Yeah!
196
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,670
Okay! Shall we go home?
197
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,300
To our hometown the Leaf Village!
198
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,300
What? I haven’t eaten yet…!
199
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,460
Don’t try to distract me by laughing!
200
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,380
Nawaki… Dan…
201
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
the boy who will inherit your dreams,
my beloved ones,
202
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,220
is right here!
203
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,630
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
204
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,130
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
205
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,300
On your still shoulder
206
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,920
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
207
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,460
The city lights are like pieces of stars
208
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,420
That hold us together
209
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:58,050
“Each one of us glows differently,”
210
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,720
you say laughingly
211
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,590
but you look most dazzling
212
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,510
Like a comet,
213
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:17,720
like the rainbow after the storm
214
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,920
You bring light into my heart
215
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:35,380
Being lost can be the answer
216
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:44,220
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
217
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,300
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
218
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,800
Yahoo! Here we are
at a hot spring spot!
219
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,460
While Pervy Sage is gawking at women,
and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,
220
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,550
I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!
221
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,460
What?! Who worked over my room?!
222
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,170
I don't know who they are,
223
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,920
but I'm gonna find them
and kick their butts!
224
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,590
Next time: "Kidnapped!
Naruto's Hot Spring Adventure!"
//%
1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,700
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,450
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,250
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,490
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,580
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,040
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,490
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,000
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,450
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,450
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,660
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,330
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,160
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,790
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,250
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,080
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,410
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,830
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,370
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,500
It’s so quiet, isn’t it?
21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,120
Peace is a wonderful thing, isn’t it?
22
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,750
Being able to…
drink sake tranquilly like this…
23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,160
Please, this isn’t the time
to be drinking sake!
24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,000
Especially at a time when
the village is enjoying peace…
25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,490
you should hurry up and
finish up your work!
26
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,490
Why is it that work
never seems to cease?
27
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,490
That’s because you never bring
a single thing to completion, Lady Tsunade!
28
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,370
There’s disquiet among
the Kamizuru Clan?
29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,490
That’s a communiqué from
the ANBU Unit
30
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,120
stationed in the Land of the Earth,
isn’t it?
31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,040
That’s a name one rarely hears.
32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,290
The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlers
of the Hidden Stone Village.
33
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,490
Long ago, they were so famous
as to be extolled
34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,910
as equals of the Aburame Clan…
35
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,490
But they’ve died out and hardly anyone
remembers their name…
36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,000
I see…
37
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,080
It says there’s been some disquiet,
but there can’t be many of them left.
38
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,540
It’s really nothing to worry about…
39
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,490
What's the difference?
Don't All Insects Look Alike?
40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,830
Wow… There are so many insects…
41
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,490
This is truly a paradise for insects…
42
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,490
We won’t get stung, will we?
43
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,040
Almost none of these insects will
cause bodily harm to humans.
44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,490
I do have some of the Aburame Clan’s
secret recipe insect repellant…
45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,580
but I would prefer not to use it,
if at all possible.
46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,950
Because it would also repel
the Bikochu.
47
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,660
Then you shouldn’t have
brought it out in the first place.
48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,490
There’s no mistake…
49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,490
That kid in the lead…
50
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,830
he’s a member of the Abarame Clan,
after all.
51
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,620
I never imagined that
we’d bump into them in a place like this.
52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,790
Is their objective the Bikochu, Jibachi?
53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,490
Anyone who wants to get their hands
on a Bikochu
54
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,490
has to come to this place
during this particular period.
55
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,490
The restoration of the Kamizuru Clan
rests on the outcome of this mission…
56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,490
We need to get our hands on
a Bikochu, no matter what!
57
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,490
This is a female bikochu.
58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Pound its characteristics into your heads.
59
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,330
Okay!
60
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,580
Got it.
61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Hey, I’ve seen this thing before…
62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,250
Hey, really?!
63
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,790
Where did you see it, Naruto?
64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,910
That was…
65
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,750
When I inadvertently leave some food out,
they start coming out of nowhere.
66
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,370
A whole deluge of them…
67
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,410
So those were Bikochu…
68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,620
If it’s those things,
they should be easy to catch.
69
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Hey…
70
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,790
Naruto…
71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,330
Those are called…cockroaches.
72
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,000
Huh? Cockroaches?
73
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,910
You're comparing apples to oranges.
74
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,750
This thing is completely different!
75
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,750
They look exactly identical to me…
76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,120
– They’re not!
– They're not!
77
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,490
Depending on how one looks of it,
this could be an opportunity.
78
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,910
What do you mean, Suzumebachi?
79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,330
It’s been ten days since we came here…
80
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,490
we haven’t been able to get
any leads on the Bikochu.
81
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,490
However, that kid from
the Abarame Clan might…
82
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,000
That makes sense!
83
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,410
You mean they might be able
to catch a Bikochu…
84
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,830
From their appearance,
it seems they're all Genin.
85
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,660
If they're able to catch
a Bikochu…
86
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,500
we'll just take it from them.
87
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,500
All insects look alike.
88
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,910
Insect Summoning Jutsu!
89
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,040
There aren’t any…here…
90
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,120
This thing here
is different too, huh…
91
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,490
Huh?
92
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,790
Don’t be a burden to everyone…
93
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,910
This mission
is something that I suggested…
94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,250
so I will find it without fail!
95
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,490
Byakugan!
96
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,330
Just as I thought…
97
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,250
it’s difficult to perceive things
as small as insects.
98
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,490
Huh?!
99
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,870
Shino! Kiba!
100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,160
Hinata…Did you notice too?
101
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,490
So…you did too?
102
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,200
I guess…they think they’re hiding…
103
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,160
Unfortunately for them,
104
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,700
we have a whole array of specialists
in detecting enemies.
105
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,910
What should we do, Shino?
You’re the leader of this mission.
106
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,490
If we end up in a battle,
there’s the danger of involving the insects…
107
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,620
and injuring the Bikochu.
108
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,490
As long as they don't make a move,
we'll just watch them closely.
109
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,490
Got it.
110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,580
I wonder if…Naruto noticed.
111
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,580
If he had noticed,
he would have raised a big clamor.
112
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,790
I don’t want to stir things up.
So don’t tell him.
113
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,500
Okay…
114
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,490
Hey, Shino! Shino!
115
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,370
I found it! I found it!
116
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,490
I’m telling you,
I found a Bikochu!
117
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,490
He found it already?!
118
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,410
That’s impossible!
119
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,490
When we spent ten days searching
and couldn’t find one…!
120
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,080
Awesome, Naruto…
121
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,580
Are you sure, Naruto?
122
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
Let me see it.
123
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,660
See…this is it, right?
124
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,120
It’s exactly like the photo, right?
125
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
I might be an insect-hunting genius.
126
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,200
Huh?
127
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,200
Does it look the same to you?
128
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,250
Huh?
129
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,410
That’s called a goliath beetle…
130
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,330
Huh?! It’s not the same thing?!
131
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,830
Bikochu aren’t active at night.
132
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,160
Which means that…
133
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,330
Let’s call it a day then.
134
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,490
Shino… Shino!
135
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,830
I found one!
This time there’s no mistake!
136
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,500
It’s probably a completely
different insect again.
137
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,540
Naruto…
138
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,830
Yeah! There’s no mistake!
139
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,660
Over here! Over here!
140
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,830
If you don’t hurry,
it’ll fly off somewhere!
141
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,950
Hey, didn’t you bring it with you?
142
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I found one that’s resting in a tree.
143
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,490
The shape of its feelers is certainly
the same as Bikochu.
144
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,490
And all the characteristics match.
145
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,040
They do, don't they?
There’s no mistake it’s this thing, right?!
146
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,490
B-But…Naruto…
147
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,750
This thing is different after all, isn’t it?
148
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,410
Why is that?
149
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,490
It's not only size! How would you make
this one sniff scents?!
150
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,490
Like this!
151
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,620
This thing is called
a Fake Bikochu.
152
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,160
It has an extremely
violent temperament…
153
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,080
It gets angry if one touches its nose
and sometimes even eats humans…
154
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,580
What?
155
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,660
Huh?
156
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,870
Hey, Shino! Didn’t you say
there weren’t any dangerous insects!
157
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,370
Almost none… but not zero.
158
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,370
Kurobachi… Jibachi…
159
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you really think they'll be able
to catch a Bikochu?
160
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,490
– That might be difficult…
– That might be difficult…
161
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,330
Unless I control my Chakra
more perfectly
162
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,790
I won’t be able to find something
as small as an insect!
163
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,160
To come all this way and
continue training…
164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,580
That’s quite admirable…
165
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,370
The air pressure has changed.
166
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,950
That’s a sure sign that
the weather will change.
167
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,410
Yeah, I realize that.
168
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,080
A wind charged with moisture
has started blowing…
169
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,160
This means
there’s gonna be rainfall.
170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,330
When it’s such good weather?
171
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,830
But I can see clouds off in the distance…
172
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,580
Hinata…
173
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,200
We need to hurry.
174
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,660
Because it’s said that the Bikochu
only lays an egg when it rains
175
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,500
and larva emerges from the egg
the following morning.
176
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,370
In other words,
177
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,500
if it rains today, it'll become
a mature larva tomorrow morning.
178
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,870
In view of the season,
this may well be our last chance.
179
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,700
If this chance slips by,
180
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,830
it will become impossible to search
for Sasuke using a Bikochu…
181
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,580
Sasuke…
182
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,410
It’ll be fine.
I’ll find it without fail!
183
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,950
Don’t rain… Don’t rain yet!
184
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,490
Damn! Where is it?!
185
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,580
Please come on out
before it rains!
186
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,500
Naruto…
187
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,040
What are we gonna do…
188
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,490
if those guys don’t find
a Bikochu, Suzumebachi?
189
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,250
It was the Aburame Clan
190
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,950
who was the catalyst in
the downfall of the Kamizuru Clan…
191
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,580
In order to avenge our clan's
longstanding grudge…
192
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,290
we will finish them off!
193
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,200
Those guys…
They haven’t made a move yet.
194
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,490
They must know that we’re searching
for the Bikochu.
195
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,540
Which means that they must be waiting
for us to find one.
196
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,580
I see…So their plan is to steal it
from us once we’ve found one...
197
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,120
What cheapskates…
198
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,750
Rain…
199
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,120
Not this one either!
200
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,660
Damn! When I told it not to rain!
201
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,410
There's no more time…
202
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,410
Don’t be a burden to everyone…
203
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,750
So ultimately…
I contributed nothing.
204
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,490
There’s still plenty of time!
205
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,490
Naruto…
206
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,910
I will not go back on my word…
That’s my Way of Ninja!
207
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,410
That’s right…
208
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,700
This mission is something
I suggested!
209
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,910
When Naruto hasn’t given up,
what’s up with me giving up?!
210
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,410
Hinata!
211
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,660
This rain may be
very advantageous to you.
212
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,450
What do you mean?
213
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,370
When the surrounding temperature cools,
214
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,830
living creatures become
easier to discern.
215
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,490
Naruto, I won’t give up either!
216
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,410
Byakugan!
217
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,540
I have to…
I have to concentrate more…
218
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,080
I need to… I need to…
control my Chakra!
219
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,000
I can see them!
So those are insects!
220
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,490
That insect…is wrong…
221
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,160
This insect is wrong too.
222
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,120
That’s…!
223
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,000
There it is!
224
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,250
Naruto! On the side of that tree!
There’s a Bikochu there!
225
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,540
I caught it!
226
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,540
We did it…!
227
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,540
I did it! I caught it!
228
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,490
There’s no mistake.
lt’s a female Bikochu.
229
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,370
– Yes! I did it! 					– Cripes…
230
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,490
Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!
231
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,580
That’s so great, Naruto!
232
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,040
Hinata! It’s thanks to you!
233
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,330
Naruto…is…hugging me…!
234
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,120
What’s the matter, Akamaru?
235
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,700
All right! It’s an egg!
236
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,080
It laid an egg, huh…
237
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,700
Really?
238
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,540
It will emerge by tomorrow…
239
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,580
So then we should make it
recognize Sasuke’s scent, right?!
240
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,370
Sasuke… I’ll find you without fail!
241
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,660
It looks like they finally found one…
242
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,490
The time has come, hasn’t it?
243
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,580
Yeah…
244
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,330
That Naruto… He suddenly…
245
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,490
pressed his face so close to mine…
246
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,000
So…you were able
to dodge that one just now.
247
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,500
That was pretty well done
for a Genin.
248
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,500
They’re the ones who’ve
been trailing us all this time…
249
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,490
However, I wonder if you’ll be able
to escape from this attack?
250
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,490
Ninja Art…Honey Jutsu!
251
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,490
Bees?!
252
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,290
No… that’s…!
253
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,490
It looks like you’ve noticed, huh.
That’s honey.
254
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,490
Honey that adheres like a bonding agent!
255
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,830
I used up all my Chakra earlier…
256
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,490
That thing is a real bee.
257
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,540
Naruto…
258
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,700
What do you think, Akamaru?
259
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,290
I see…
260
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,950
I was convinced that those guys
would make some kind of move.
261
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,200
There hasn’t been any sign
of them since earlier on…
262
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,370
There’s a possibility that
we’ve overlooked something.
263
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,410
Hey, Naruto!
264
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,450
Huh?
265
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,490
Where’s Hinata?
266
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,080
She said she was gonna
go wash her face.
267
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,250
Hmm…
268
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,040
But it’s been quite some time.
I wonder what she’s doing?
269
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,250
Could it be that…?!
270
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,580
Huh? What?
271
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,490
– Naruto! 					– Wha--?!
272
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,040
A letter on a Kunai?
273
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,200
Huh?!
274
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,410
We are holding the Kunoichi
brat hostage.
275
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,000
If you want to get her back,
276
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,000
it’ll be in exchange for
the Bikochu.
277
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,490
Come to the top of
the eastern hill later tonight.
278
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Damn! So that was their move!
279
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,160
Hinata…!
280
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,620
Crappy news pass us by
281
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,200
And you become speechless
282
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,200
My voice is way too soft
283
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,490
So you don’t answer
284
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,120
You’re crying   Crying alone
285
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,950
What can I do?   I’m crying too
286
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,490
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
287
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:07,660
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
288
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:17,410
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
289
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:26,490
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
290
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:38,370
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
291
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,580
Damn! We've run out of options!
292
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,660
It's too soon to give up.
293
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,000
But we don't even know
where Hinata is?!
294
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,040
No, there's one place Hinata
is sure to appear.
295
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,040
I get it! The place where
the exchange will take place!
296
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,950
We have one chance.
297
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,750
Awright! I'll do it!
298
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,160
I'll protect Hinata and
the Faint Scent Beetle without fail!
299
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,660

The Deceivers and the Deceived!”

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,250
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,460
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,790
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,790
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,550
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,380
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,670
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:51,800
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,340
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,790
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,500
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,790
Fighting Dreamers

00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,630
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,210
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,790
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,500
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,710
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,050
The Third Hokage, Forever…
21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,250
Sarutobi…
22
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,630
At the very least this sword…
23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,500
It was a fitting end for somebody like you
24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,710
who has mastered
the Way of the Shinobi.
25
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,380
It feels like my arms are burning…
26
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,880
Master Orochimaru!
27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,300
This is where we call off our plan.
28
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,210
Release the Barrier.
We’ll head back.
29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,340
– Yes! 					– Yes!
30
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,630
– Release! 					– Release!
31
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,710
The Barrier…!
32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,710
It’s released!
33
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,790
Where is Lord Hokage?
34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,750
Let’s go!
35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,590
We won’t let you get away!
36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,880
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!
37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,550
An adhesive type of string
filled with Chakra…?
38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,790
Kakashi! They’re on the move!
Do we go after them?
39
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,250
No, wait, Guy.
40
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,550
That’s right…
41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,790
If you make a move without
any data on the situation up there,
42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
you will get caught in
the enemy’s trap.
43
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,420
I’m totally aware of that.
44
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,420
But regardless of whether
there is a trap or not,
45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,790
we can’t let the enemy get away
at a time like this!
46
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,050
That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!
47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,960
So…are you just going to watch?
48
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,500
Kabuto?
49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,790
So you did know, after all.
50
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,790
So…what are we going to do?
51
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,590
It’s about time that
we made a retreat.
52
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,790
You’re going to run away
from me again?
53
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,460
Right now…
54
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,790
if we show our cards,
they’re most likely going to be copied.
55
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,340
Then again,
56
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,210
it doesn't seem like you’ve completely
mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.
57
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,630
Well then…
58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,840
Temari…
59
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
Kankuro!
60
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,920
I’m leaving Sakura with you.
61
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,340
H-Hey!
62
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,090
Why is…this guy so strong?
63
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
My existence will not disappear…
64
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,790
I will not disappear!
I cannot disappear!
65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,170
I told you not to talk to that guy!
66
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,630
Let’s go.
67
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,130
Oh, there! That’s him…
68
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,750
Go away!
69
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,590
Monster! Monster! Monster…!
70
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,790
You monster! Die!
71
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,750
That’s him… Don’t get involved, fool!
72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,500
Don’t look at him!
73
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,790
Go away!
74
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,500
To them, I’m just a relic of the past
who they want to see disappear.
75
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,630
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?
76
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,790
And that time, I thought of myself that I…
no, that is what I had to think.
77
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,380
And then knew that
it was the most painful thing.
78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,790
That I… that my existence didn’t matter
to anyone else in the world.
79
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,790
D-Don’t come any closer!
80
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:49,460
The pain of…being all alone…
really is unbearable, isn’t it?
81
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,630
The way you feel…
82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,590
I don’t know why,
but I completely understand that it hurts.
83
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,710
But I’ve met people who are
very important to me now.
84
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,670
I won’t allow those important people…
to get hurt!
85
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,790
If not, I will stop you even if
that means…that I have to kill you!
86
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Why…?
87
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,790
How is it that you can fight so much
for other people?
88
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,550
They saved me from the hell
of being all alone.
89
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,380
They accepted me for who I was.
90
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,000
That’s why…they are important to me!
91
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,800
Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,
92
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,710
to love and watch over that person…
93
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,790
Love…
94
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,090
That is why he is so strong?
95
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,050
That’s enough, Naruto…
96
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,090
Sakura is okay.
97
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,590
This guy’s Chakra must
have been depleted as well…
98
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,790
Sakura’s sand crumbled
a long time ago.
99
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,380
Oh, I see…
100
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,790
I’ve had enough… Stop here.
101
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Gaara?
102
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,880
I’ve never seen Gaara in such
a weakened state before…
103
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,550
All right.
104
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,000
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
105
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
LOVE
One of these days, even I…
106
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,880
Temari… Kankuro…
107
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,170
– Huh? 					– Huh?
108
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,170
Sorry…
109
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,800
D-Don’t worry about it…
110
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,340
Rain…
111
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,000
The sky has started to weep as well…
112
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,300
We will begin the memorial service
113
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,790
for the Third Hokage,
who lost his life in this battle,
114
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,550
as well as the other victims
of this battle.
115
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,790
It’s started…
116
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,920
In the end,
all we could do was just watch…
117
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,790
Why?
118
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,590
Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
119
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Why…?
120
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,380
It’s already been a year…
121
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,250
It’s not easy to laugh
hiding your sadness.
122
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,340
I heard from your teacher that
you’re the center of laughter…
123
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,840
I’m not sad at all!
124
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,960
It’s a very honorable thing for
a Shinobi to die doing their duty!
125
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,250
My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
126
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,460
to protect this village
from the Demon Fox…
127
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,840
They’re heroes!
128
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,750
I am the child of the heroes!
I’m not sad to be alone.
129
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,550
And besides, these are tears of joy.
130
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,790
It’s all right.
131
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,790
I know that you’re curled up
holding your knees by yourself.
132
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,210
But you’re not alone…
133
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,000
Huh?
134
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,460
The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village
have the will of fire…
135
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,130
Will of fire…?
136
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,130
It’s the strong will to protect
the Leaf Village.
137
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,710
As long as they have this will of fire,
everybody in this village are all family.
138
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,130
Iruka… I wonder if you have it?
139
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,460
Yeah…
140
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,300
For Hayate…?
141
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,090
The Third Hokage’s funeral
has already started. Make it quick.
142
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,670
You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito…?
143
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,000
If you’re always thinking of
an excuse for your tardiness,
144
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,710
you should just come earlier.
145
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,300
I do…from early in the morning.
146
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,460
It’s just that,
whenever I come here
147
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,670
I just want to punish myself
for being such a fool in the past.
148
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,790
Humph…
149
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,050
Shinobi, no matter what kind
of situation they are in,
150
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,380
cannot show their emotion.
151
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,340
You must always prioritize your mission,
152
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,250
and never shed a tear in
any kind of situation…
153
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,790
Iruka Sensei…
154
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,670
Hmm?
155
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,500
Why do people risk their own lives
for other people?
156
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,300
When one person dies…
157
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,170
their past, their present life, and their future
disappear along with them.
158
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,340
Many people die doing their duty
and fighting in battle…
159
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,550
And shockingly easily, too.
160
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,170
Hayate was one of them.
161
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,800
Those who pass away also
have dreams and ambitions.
162
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,460
But everyone has something else,
just as important.
163
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:50,130
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers…
Those who are dear to them.
164
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,790
They trust each other and help each other,
165
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,790
the people whom they’ve cherished
since the day they were born.
166
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,790
And that string which connects
those people
167
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,630
becomes stronger and
thicker as time goes by…
168
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,790
It can’t be explained by logic…
169
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,170
Those who hold those strings just do it,
because it’s important to them.
170
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,210
Yeah, I kind of get it.
171
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,210
But…
172
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,790
It's tough to die.
173
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,710
It’s not like he just died for nothing.
174
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,380
He left us something very important.
175
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,790
Well, you’ll eventually understand
one of these days.
176
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,790
Yeah, I kind of get that too!
177
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,130
The rain’s stopped.
178
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,300
Bye! Iruka Sensei!
179
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,460
Yeah…
180
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,750
Lord Third Hokage,
the will of fire you spoke of
181
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,790
seems to have been passed on
to the young Leaves.
182
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,960
The flame in their hearts
which you lit
183
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,750
will burn bright and strong…
184
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,130
And it will shine upon this village,
and watch over and protect us.
185
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,170
It will become a new Hokage…
one of these days…
186
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,960
They did manage to avoid annihilation,
187
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,750
but it seems the damage
is pretty extensive.
188
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,000
The village that was once
at the height of its glory…
189
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,880
How sad…
190
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,460
How unlike you.
191
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,840
You have lingering affections
for your old home?
192
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,880
Even you?
193
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,130
No, not at all.
194
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,840
A cycle of hardship, right?
195
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Inside, we were crying, right?
196
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:40,300
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
197
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,210
It's a secondary role,
198
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,960
a role in the shadows
199
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,420
But in reaching for that dream,
200
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,250
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
201
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,210
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
202
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,170
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
203
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:19,460
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
204
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,920
Over and over,
we've seen fools
205
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,630
The ritual ends, and morning mist
will be covering all soon.
206
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,790
Silence…
207
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,500
In that white mist,
the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.
208
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:07,130
It awakens childhood memory,
disappointment, ire, and resolve.
209
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,590
The cog wheel named destiny
slowly begins to turn…
210
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,460
Next time: “Return of the Morning Mist”
//%
1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,410
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,910
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,540
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,120
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,540
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,540
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,200
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,040
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,330
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,700
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:58,000
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,580
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,160
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,660
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,290
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,870
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,580
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,000
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,370
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,200
My body movements
have finally returned…
21
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,620
Blood…
22
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,870
Lady Tsunade!
23
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,750
Say! Say! What’s happening?!
24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,790
Why’s Kabuto fighting
with Old Lady Tsunade?!
25
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,040
Take a good look at the headband!
26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,540
He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
27
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,740
That man is Orochimaru…
29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,410
Shizune, you take care of
the guy with the glasses…
30
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,450
I’ll take care of Orochimaru.
31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,330
Before that, I’d like to have Tsunade
do something about this body.
32
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,410
The effects of that drug
might still last for awhile…
33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,790
There’s nothing that
I can do about it.
34
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,830
What? Really?
35
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,660
Geez. I guess it can’t be helped.
36
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,580
I have no choice
but to fight in this condition.
37
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,450
Tsunade… Rest your body
with Recovery Ninjutsu.
38
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,660
Then… What about me, me?
39
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,000
You guard Tsunade together
with that pig.
40
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,450
What?! I want to fight, too.
Even I can--
41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,620
No, you won’t!
42
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,740
Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
43
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,790
You’re on a different level.
44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,790
The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
45
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,790
and the man who killed
the Third Hokage.
46
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,450
An eye for an eye…
I’m the only one who can fight him.
47
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,620
And that four-eyed guy possesses
the same level of power as Kakashi.
48
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay.
49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,160
Then… Shadow Clo--
50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Hold it!
51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,740
Don’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
lt’d be utterly pointless.
52
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,740
What?
53
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,000
It wouldn’t even become
much of a diversion…
54
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,790
It’d be a waste of Chakra…
55
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,740
with them as opponents.
56
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,740
Now then, let’s get this thing started.
57
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,500
– Summoning Jutsu.
– Summoning Jutsu.
58
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
Hi.
59
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,250
– Huh?! 					– What is this?!
60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,950
– Wha--?!
– What the heck’s going on?!
61
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,740
Long time no see.
62
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,500
On account of the drug,
63
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,500
Master Jiraiya still can’t build up
Chakra very well.
64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,740
It looks like your stupid
still hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya.
65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,740
That’s too much even for you
with no ability.
66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,740
It seems Tsunade got you
with something.
67
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,950
A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
68
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,160
so perhaps she was thinking ahead
and drugged him
69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,740
with something that
would contain his power.
70
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,740
To think she’d make
a sacrifice of Jiraiya…
71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
72
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,740
To think I’d already have
my handicap spotted.
73
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,040
You are such
a disgraceful guy as always…
74
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,740
Dang it. It kind of ticks me off
when the Pervy Sage is mocked.
75
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,830
Summoning…Jutsu!
76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,500
The Nine-Tailed Fox kid
from the Chunin Exam.
77
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,410
I wonder if I should’ve killed him then,
after all.
78
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,740
For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
79
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,120
I acknowledged his achievement…
and let him slide by.
80
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,870
But the only ones who can break
a Five-Pronged Spell
81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,740
are the Sannin members
and the Third Hokage.
82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,500
Which means Jiraiya may have
already taught it to Naruto.
83
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,950
Perhaps.
84
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,620
If he’s able to control
the Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
85
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,740
Oh…
86
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,740
Th-This is…
87
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,790
It doesn’t quite look to be so.
88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,000
He isn’t endowed with Shinobi ability
to begin with, so…
89
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,080
Why?
90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,620
He’s still got a long way to go,
sure enough.
91
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Why?!
92
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,660
Hello.
93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,250
Hey, Gamatatsu.
Why did you come out?
94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,910
Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
95
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,950
It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned.
96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
I-I wonder if I can do my best?
97
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,540
Idiot. Get some snacks
or something and hide.
98
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,500
What? I can get snacks?
Goody-goody.
99
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,750
Here I go.
100
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,580
I’ll take Jiraiya.
101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,740
I leave the rest to you.
102
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,740
It’s unfortunate…
103
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,830
Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya,
one of the Sannin.
104
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,740
Naruto!
105
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,290
Your opponent is me.
106
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,740
Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
107
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,080
Dang it. I can’t completely sink them
with such a puny swamp.
108
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,910
The drug is still working.
109
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,790
But…with this, the snakes can’t move.
110
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,740
Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
111
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,450
I’ll be up a creek if
I take even one breath.
112
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,740
My leg tendons…!
113
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,910
I won’t be eaten twice…!
No way!
114
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,740
Here I go.
115
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,290
Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
116
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,330
Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well.
117
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,540
Even if we both have handicaps,
you won’t one-up me…
118
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,830
Give up now.
119
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,540
It’s unfortunate…
120
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,740
Here I had respected you
as a fellow Medical Ninja.
121
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,330
Stop. Stay back!
122
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,910
Please hang on, Lady Tsunade…
123
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,200
The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru
is also called, will cry.
124
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,620
My body’s heavy.
125
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,740
To think you who were
once called the village madness
126
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,580
would ferry around such a kid
and struggle tirelessly for the village.
127
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,250
You’ve really fallen, haven’t you?
128
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,410
I have a keen eye to discern ability.
129
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,450
And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes.
130
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,750
It’s precisely for this reason…
that I don’t need the Uchiha kid.
131
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,370
It’s no fun raising a genius
who’s good from the start.
132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,450
So you can’t leave him alone
133
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
because it’s like you’re looking
at your old self?
134
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,080
That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inherited
the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
135
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,790
And that’s because Naruto
doesn’t possess the Sharingan.
136
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,950
Shinobi ability is about whether
137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,910
one can use and master
all the Jutsu of the world.
138
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,740
Ninja refers to one
who can use Ninjutsu.
139
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,250
Shinobi ability is no such thing.
140
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,330
You still don’t get it?
141
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,410
A Ninja…is one who endures.
142
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,740
It’s a difference of opinion, huh.
143
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,740
I’ll teach you one thing.
144
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,330
What’s most important for Shinobi ability…
145
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,250
isn’t the number of Jutsu
one possesses.
146
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,910
What’s important is…
147
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,950
The mettle…
148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,740
not to give up.
149
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Enough already…you jerk!
150
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,740
The mettle to never give up…
151
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,200
He possesses that.
152
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,000
Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned,
153
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,740
but you can’t hit me with
such a large motion.
154
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,330
No good.
155
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,040
It won’t easily hit with
a moving opponent.
156
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,830
Owwee!
157
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,620
And the Chakra isn’t
completely held, yet…
158
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,410
It seems you got a cracked thigh bone
in your left leg
159
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,740
from the battle with the snake.
160
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,740
Well, you can still move if
it’s just the bone.
161
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,040
But it’s impossible now…
162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,290
The lateral vastus muscle
in your right leg is totally cut off.
163
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,040
What should I do…?
164
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,830
That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
165
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,080
If even one arm is taken out, it’s over.
166
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,120
Are you scared of me?
167
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,500
Do you want to run away from here?
168
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,750
Naruto, as I recall,
169
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,200
you whooped it up like this
during the first Chunin Exam.
170
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,410
Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away!
171
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,000
"Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away."
172
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,160
"I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…"
173
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,830
"I’ll become the Hokage at any cost,
so it’s okay with me."
174
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,740
"I’m not scared."
175
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,450
Can you…
whoop it up in the same way now?
176
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,160
Unlike you…
177
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,740
I will be the heir to the Hokage name
no matter what!
178
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,660
– Hokage is my dream!
– Hokage is my dream!
179
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,410
You’re not a kid anymore,
so you should stop whooping it up…
180
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,200
Depending on the situation,
181
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,410
when you want to give up and run away,
you should run away.
182
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,450
Oh my… What’s with that look?
183
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,740
You’ll die! If you die,
there are no dreams or anything…
184
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,700
Do you want to die?
185
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,700
You’re still a Genin,
so you should run away on the battlefield.
186
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,120
Don’t tell a man to run away.
187
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,830
Kids think that everything is easy.
188
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,370
That’s why they talk about foolish dreams
like nothing at all.
189
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,740
That’s why they can’t give up.
190
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,370
Jiraiya, was it you
who taught him that Rasengan?
191
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,250
Are you acting like a teacher by teaching
a Jutsu that can’t be learned?
192
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,290
Don’t give him false hopes.
193
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,290
That’s why a moony kid starts joking
that he’ll become the Hokage!
194
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,740
They chase after foolish dreams…
and then die.
195
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,740
If I have three days,
I’ll master that Jutsu.
196
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Then let's make a bet.
197
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,790
Bastard!
198
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,410
As for me… I stand by my words.
199
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,040
That’s…my Way of Ninja!
200
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
A bet?
201
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,790
I’ll give you one week.
202
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,750
If you can master that Jutsu,
203
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,000
I’ll acknowledge that
you’ll be able to become the Hokage…
204
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,410
and give you this necklace.
205
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,660
You should’ve just
stayed out of this…
206
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,330
Why?
207
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,700
Why?!
208
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,450
Old Lady Tsunade…
209
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,660
You’re still going to get up?
210
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,950
Just like our wager
211
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,040
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.
212
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,950
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,750
Shadow Clone won’t do anything now.
214
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto.
Stop it!
215
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,040
I told you that you’d die
if you were obstinate like that, right?
216
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,080
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing.
217
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,080
Just get out of the way. Run away.
218
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,700
Humph… It’s okay.
219
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,950
I…
220
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,740
I absolutely will not die…
221
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,450
until I become the Hokage!
222
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,290
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!
223
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,290
It’s the same Chakra movement
as before.
224
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,740
No, this is…different.
225
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,580
I see.
226
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,910
In order to gain a hand
for suppressing Chakra,
227
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,500
the Shadow Clone…
228
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,290
Compress Chakra and…
229
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,830
hold it completely.
230
00:20:59,330 --> 00:20:59,950
Wha--?!
231
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,740
I-It can’t be.
232
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,870
Rasengan!
233
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,740
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
234
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,040
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
235
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,200
On your still shoulder
236
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,830
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
237
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,580
The city lights are like pieces of stars
238
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,330
That hold us together
239
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:57,950
“Each one of us glows differently,”
240
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,740
you say laughingly
241
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,740
but you look most dazzling
242
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,660
Like a comet,
243
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,740
like the rainbow after the storm
244
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,830
You bring light into my heart
245
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:35,290
Being lost can be the answer
246
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:44,120
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
247
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,200
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
248
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,580
I never forget my ideal…
249
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,950
to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf
and protect its people.
250
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,740
The Hokages have sacrificed
their lives for that dream.
251
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,790
And now,
I also will put my life on the line.
252
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,410
From this moment,
I am the Fifth Hokage!
253
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,740
Next time: "The Fifth Hokage!
A Life on the Line!"
//%
1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,550
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,560
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,560
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,430
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,540
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,540
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,650
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,480
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,890
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,920
It will come, closer
11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,830
Now
12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,410
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,610
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,540
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,120
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,580
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,190
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,560
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,190
Tenten vs. Temari
20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,560
The fifth battle…
21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,230
Tenten, Temari…come forward!
22
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,170
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,880
Now…The second one from
the Land of Sand, huh…
24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Do your best!
25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,880
– Tenten!
– It looks like it's going to be interesting.
26
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,630
Begin!
27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,500
Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru
28
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,810
Go for it, Tenten!
29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,610
Believe in your own strength, Tenten!
30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,750
We’re behind you, Tenten!
31
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,350
Knock her with all your strength!
32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,550
That’s good!
33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,550
Cheer her on more, more,
more with passion, Lee!
34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,020
Yeah!
35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,390
These guys are noisy!
36
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,900
That spacing is just what I’d expect
from Tenten,
37
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,140
not too close, not too far.
38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,710
Attacks or defense,
she can respond to either one.
39
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,980
What happened?
40
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,380
Please begin.
41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,080
Are you planning to wait out and
see how I make my move?
42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,550
Let me just tell you,
43
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,660
once I start my attack
you’ll be over in a second.
44
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,690
You’re trying to be cool and
see what I do first…
45
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,700
A hundred years too early!
46
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,570
It doesn’t matter to me, come first.
47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,470
You said it…
48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,170
Well, I won’t hold back.
49
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,810
They missed?
50
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,110
That’s impossible!
51
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,550
What happened?
ls that a warm-up?
52
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,550
Or are you scared and your aim is off?
53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,190
I thought I would enjoy it
a little bit more,
54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,390
but evidently it’s not promising.
55
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,560
No way!
56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,960
I can’t believe Tenten’s attack missed!
57
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,900
It’s unbelievable indeed.
58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,130
Tenten’s weapons...
59
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,900
always hits the mark
ten out of ten times.
60
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,540
There no reason for them to miss.
61
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,840
That’s right...
She didn’t miss.
62
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,550
She was made to miss.
63
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,120
As always, she’s being disagreeable.
64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,550
How foolish…
65
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,350
How disgraceful!
66
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,560
Huh?
67
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,890
Sand wins again.
68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,360
We don’t know that yet.
69
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,200
We know.
70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,060
How? 					How do we know?
71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,130
Explain it so I understand!
72
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,470
Stupid... As if I'd do
such a bothersome thing.
73
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,980
Shikamaru said it so,
surely that’s how it is.
74
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,980
These guys are hard to understand.
75
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,250
Calm down…
76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,160
Don’t let her get to you…
77
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,390
One.
78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,260
Two.
79
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,430
Three…
80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,600
If it’s gonna get dodged,
81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,570
I just have to make
it impossible to!
82
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,710
So she’s measuring the spacing,
next one is going to be the big attack.
83
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,540
I get it…
84
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,540
So, that fan is the secret.
85
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,650
If so…
86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,960
How about…this?!
87
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,480
No way!
88
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,310
My flying weapons!
89
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,150
Is there a secret mechanism
in the fan…?
90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,250
This is…
91
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
the first star.
92
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,190
There are two more.
93
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,760
When the third star appears,
94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,060
you will lose.
95
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,070
Tenten!
96
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,070
Don’t be taken in by
your opponent, be calm!
97
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,940
Be calm!
98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
I know…
99
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,540
Lee, I really intended to use
this in the main battle,
100
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,210
not the preliminary round--
101
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,550
but it looks like I can’t do it that way.
102
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,420
She’s already going to use it?
103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,230
Pulling out two scrolls?
104
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,300
What does she intend to do?
105
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,140
Hah! No matter what you do,
it won’t work.
106
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,480
Rising Twin Dragons!
107
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,910
Even if you increase the amount,
it’s still the same!
108
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,110
Second star!
109
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,680
I’m not done yet!
110
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,540
Did I do it?
111
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,260
Third star.
112
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,760
She disappeared!
113
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,570
Where is she?
114
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,540
I’m over here!
115
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,740
Darn--!
116
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,650
Ninja Art!
117
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,720
Wind Scythe Jutsu!
118
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,560
Tenten!
119
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,840
Chakra is enfolded in that wind.
120
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,580
Huh?!
121
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,810
Tenten fought well…
122
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,180
But she won’t be able to escape from
that twister.
123
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,190
T-That’s awful.
124
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,130
Tenten…!
125
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,530
How boring... really.
126
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,540
To think she completely intercepted
Tenten’s weapon attacks.
127
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,370
This is ridiculous!
128
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,340
What’s going on with her…?
129
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,980
It’s just like Shikamaru said,
it’s the Sand’s win.
130
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,350
That’s why I said it.
131
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,260
There’s no reason for us to lose here.
132
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,360
The Land of Sand is to be feared…
133
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,570
Temari wins the fifth battle.
134
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,540
Oh no!
135
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,720
Nice catch.
136
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,020
What are you doing?!
137
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,030
Is that something you do to
an opponent who fought to the utmost?!
138
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,560
You’re annoying!
139
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,860
Take that trash away already!
140
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Stop! Lee!
141
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,170
Leaf Hurricane!
142
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,200
What?!
143
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,070
You’re just like you look…
144
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,580
You’re dull too.
145
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,980
What did you say?!
146
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,880
Stop! Lee!
147
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,810
Guy Sensei!
148
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,380
Temari.
149
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,550
Come up quick, you’ve been
declared the winner.
150
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,960
Don’t keep company with that awful-looking
guy and his chaperone forever.
151
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,730
What…?!
152
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,140
That’s enough, Lee.
153
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,150
Gentlemen of Sand…
154
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,180
I wonder if I may give you
a word of warning.
155
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,150
This kid is strong.
156
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,560
You should prepare yourselves.
157
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,560
Picking a fight with the Sand…
158
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,270
I absolutely wouldn't want to
do it with those guys.
159
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,400
T-They’re all awesome guys…
160
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,580
Don’t lose to those guys!
161
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,550
Naruto!
162
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,510
S-Sakura.
163
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,720
Sakura… Are you okay already?
164
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,550
Never mind that,
you should worry about yourself!
165
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,760
Huh? Me? I don’t have
an injury or anything.
166
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,390
That’s not what I mean.
167
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,560
If you lose here, it’s a point of dishonor.
168
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,570
You’d be ashamed to face Sasuke!
169
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,430
Y- Yeah.
170
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,770
And…
171
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,540
Thanks for earlier…
172
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,540
No!
173
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,710
Sakura!
174
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,750
You did your hardest
to get here!
175
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,550
You’ll disgrace women if
you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
176
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,590
If it weren’t for your stupid cheering
at that time…
177
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,560
I would have been soundly
beaten by Ino.
178
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,590
Yeah, that's right.
179
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Y-You!
180
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,970
Okay, hurry hurry! 					Me next!
181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,570
Next! 					Next is my turn!
182
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin
183
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,340
Darn!
184
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,180
It’s me.
185
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,110
Shikamaru, don’t lose!
186
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
– Show us that you’re a real man!
– All right, all right.
187
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,320
Get her with the 16 combo, go!
188
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,690
– Win Shikamaru!
– Ino’s become super energetic.
189
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,130
You go for it!
190
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,730
That guy manipulates shadows.
191
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Be careful of the shadows…
192
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,440
I won’t be beaten by
a stupid technique like that.
193
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,210
Shikamaru!
194
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,180
Bash that one around!
And while you're at it...
195
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,010
Man, what a pain.
196
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,250
Furthermore, my opponent is a woman…
lt's hard to get to it.
197
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,420
If that’s what you think,
I’ll end this quickly.
198
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,190
Go, go! Shikamaru!
199
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,090
Well, you could say that
I know these guys’ raw power
200
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,730
from that incident from the second test…
201
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,570
I don’t know anything about this one’s Jutsu.
202
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,440
On top of that, she’s seen my Jutsu…
203
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,780
– The sixth battle.
– That being said, for me…
204
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,380
Shikamaru versus Kin!
205
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,510
Begin!
206
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,380
I can only do this.
207
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,720
One trick pony, huh…?
208
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,090
Shut up!
209
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,560
Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!
210
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,690
That Jutsu!
211
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,560
It’s nothing if I just pay attention
to the movement of your shadow!
212
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,640
Bells…?
213
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,510
Heh, that’s a classic.
214
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,540
Next, you’ll throw Senbons with bells
215
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,350
and Senbons without bells
at the same time, right?
216
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,420
I’ll respond to the sound of the bells,
intending to dodge them.
217
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,150
But I won't notice the quiet Senbons,
and, ouch.
218
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,090
Is that right?
219
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,560
You’re a chatty guy!
220
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,400
So in order to not get caught
by the shadow Senbons…
221
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,300
I'm alert to the trick
and look closely…
222
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,130
What?!
223
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,530
Behind?!
224
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,540
String?
225
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,840
Darn it!
226
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,540
Too late!
227
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,650
Shikamaru!
228
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,480
He took that pretty bad.
229
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,080
It wasn’t tat bad, look closely.
230
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,550
Huh?
231
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,690
F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.
232
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,720
Now it’s my turn!
233
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,560
That’s not going to happen.
234
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,610
W-What’s this?
235
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,550
That happens to anyone
who hears my bell.
236
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,550
The sound vibration of
this special bell
237
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,720
reaches the brain directly
from the ear drum.
238
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,330
And then it will make you hallucinate.
239
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
It’s useless!
240
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,530
You can’t avoid the sound of
my bell by doing...
241
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,540
that... that... that... that... that...
242
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,010
Shoot! Which one?
Which is the real one?
243
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,040
You can’t do anything, can you?
244
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,250
Your shadow, which was your faint hope,
doesn’t even know where to stretch to…
245
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,890
Well… I’ll cook you slowly.
246
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,560
Taking me lightly…!
247
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,540
This time it’s five,
next time seven…
248
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,940
I’ll continue until you become
a hedgehog.
249
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,510
Y-You’re lying, you brat!
250
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,110
Huh?!
251
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,450
You’d end it soon…
252
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,880
That’s what you said
in the beginning, isn’t it?
253
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,690
I see, you can’t endure the pain
and want to be eased.
254
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,690
Well, I’ll finish it here.
255
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,360
It’s your death warrant.
256
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,730
W-What?!
257
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,530
M-My body…
258
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,540
At last, Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success.
259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,640
W-What are you saying?
260
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,610
No way!
Your shadow isn’t anywhere...
261
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,420
You don’t realize it yet?
262
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,550
I-It can’t be…
263
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,450
It's just that, you fool!
264
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,430
A thread at this height
can’t have a shadow.
265
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,060
I can stretch and shrink
my own shadow.
266
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,270
The shadow is gradually getting thicker.
267
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,540
This wasn’t the shadow of the thread…
268
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,470
That's right. I stretched my shadow
and made it narrow,
269
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,280
so it looked like the shadow of
a thread and stuck it on you.
270
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,720
But… How do you win with that?
271
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,420
I’m just gonna move
the same way as you.
272
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,850
Annoying.
273
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,390
Be quiet and watch.
274
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,230
Stupid!
275
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,900
If you continue like this and attack…
276
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,470
You, too, 					will be wounded!
277
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,440
I know that.
278
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,270
No way! You're...!
279
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,580
We’re gonna throw shuriken
at each other.
280
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,850
How far will we go…?
281
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,810
Fool, stop it!
282
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,990
You're only talk...
283
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,460
And that one's a goner.
284
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
If you’re a shinobi,
285
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,560
you have to grasp the situation
and the layout when you battle.
286
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,400
Even though we made
the same movements…
287
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,670
the distance of the walls behind
each of us was different.
288
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,070
I just used the shuriken and
289
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,310
called attention away
from the wall behind us.
290
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,180
Winner! Shikamaru Nara.
291
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,380
Good job Shikamaru!
292
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,890
Cool!
293
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,920
Me next…
294
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,390
Me next… Me next…!
295
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,060
That guy’s dull and plain,
but that was kinda cool.
296
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,930
Shoot!
297
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,460
I’m the only one left.
298
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,400
And the next match.
299
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,270
The people left are one Sound ninja,
300
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,610
me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.
301
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,540
And that Sand guy…
302
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,380
Just please spare me from that guy.
303
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,180
This year’s rookie looks quite challenging…
304
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,370
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
305
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,000
It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!
306
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,740
What we’ve been waiting for!
307
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,540
It’s finally my turn!
308
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,980
Yeah! Lucky us!
309
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,810
If it’s this guy
we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!
310
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,910
Yahoo!
311
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,420
– If I’m not next, Sakura will despise me...
– I'm gonna do it!
312
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,720
– and call me Bushy Brow.
– I'm gonna go for it!
313
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,020
– If I’m not next. Sakura will...
– Just watch me! Yay!
314
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,030
This Lee kid, he’s just like
Guy was in the past…
315
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,930
Do your best, Naruto.
316
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,170
Leave it to me.
317
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,970
Well Naruto, show us…
318
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,380
how much you’ve grown.
319
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,550
I’m going to do it!
320
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,490
Hey, can you hear it?
321
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:32,840
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
322
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:42,550
The ocean spans limitlessly
323
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:50,720
Please keep that smile on your face forever
324
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,630
Or else I’ll cry
325
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,560
You won't have to search around you
326
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,300
It’s all ok now.
327
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:14,140
Everyone is inside
this hand
328
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,550
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
329
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,050
When you forget what happiness is
330
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,860
Just sing.
331
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,360
Light is born, and darkness was born
332
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,570
The two are one
333
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:41,910
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
334
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,540
Hey, can you hear it?
335
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,250
Darn that Kiba!
336
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,990
I hold back a little bit and
he rides my brain.
337
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,560
Yap, yap, yap, yap,
it’s annoying! Believe it!
338
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,560
Just quit talking tough, and use your dog
or whatever, and come at me!
339
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,460
I don’t know what kind of
training you’ve done,
340
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,960
but I’m the man who’s going
to become Hokage.
341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,630
You’re the one who’s going
to get his butt kicked.
342
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,900
Next time: “Akamaru Unleashed!
Who’s Top Dog Now?”
343
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,210
Don’t take me lightly!
//%
1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,180
One more time
4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,890
Are you really happy
5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,810
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:45,430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,680
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,760
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,760
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:17,890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,760
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
One more time
15
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,770
Where am I?!
16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,640
I’ve been saved.
17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,470
Oh?
18
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,760
Awesome… He’s pretty darn big…
19
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,140
Oh yeah…
20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,760
This is a…frog…isn’t it…?
21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,220
Oopsadaisy…
22
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,600
Let’s see now…
23
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,310
No tail!
24
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,180
This is…!
25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,020
Not like this one.
26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,310
Or that one.
27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,970
It’s really…
28
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,100
A real…
29
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,760
Frog!
30
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,770
He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks!
Chief Toad Appears!
31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Looks like he extracted the
Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox
32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
all on his own this time.
33
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,930
But still, one certainly can’t
say he’s stable yet…
34
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,760
He overused the large Charka…
35
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,060
To think that of all the frogs
he summoned that one…
36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,310
I did it…
37
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,760
Hey, you little brat!
38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Huh?
39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,430
Huh? Huh? Huh?!
40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,760
You little brat…
41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,220
On whose head do you think
you’re raising a ruckus!
42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,760
This is the top of Gamabunta,
the Chief Toad’s head! You idiot!
43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Quiet down…
44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,390
Oh!
45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,060
W-What the heck is this guy?!
46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,850
He seems pretty awesome, but…
47
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,430
Gimme a break!
48
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,850
Just when I’m breathing the air of
the free world after a long time,
49
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,310
some weird kid is raising
a ruckus on top of my head.
50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,680
Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!
51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,770
What the heck do
you think you’re doing?!
52
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,930
Hmm… This doesn’t look good…
53
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,520
’Cause even I can’t handle
that Gamabunta…
54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,390
Jiraiya! Hurry up and
show yourself, you idiot!
55
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,520
Hmmm…lt would be troublesome if
that Gama found me out…
56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
I better get my ass out of here
without any further delay.
57
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,560
Hey, little brat!
58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,760
Y-Yes…?
59
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,220
Where’s Jiraiya?
60
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,060
Huh…? Jiraiya…?
61
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,560
Who’s that…?
62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,850
I’m talking about that lecher who
calls himself Toad Sage or something!
63
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,930
Where’s Jiraiya? Huh?!
64
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,560
S-Scary…
65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,680
If you just follow my orders,
66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,310
I wouldn’t mind making you
my henchman!
67
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,020
Hurry up and answer me!
68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,760
Okay! If you’re talking about
the Pervy Sage,
69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,100
he’s on the cliff up there,
Chief Toad.
70
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,970
Up there, huh…?
71
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,680
Um… Can I ask you one question?
72
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,220
What is it?
73
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,520
What business do you have
with that Pervy Sage?
74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,140
That’s the question I want
to ask that pervert!
75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,100
What the heck does he want
summoning me to a place like this?!
76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,100
B-But…
77
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,220
What is it?
78
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,760
I’m the one who summoned
you, Chief Toad..
79
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,100
I fell off the cliff…
80
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,680
and thought maybe you
could come to my aid…
81
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,100
Please…
82
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,560
Hmm…?
83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,470
What does a kid like you think
he’s saying out of the blue.
84
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,760
There’s no way a little squirt like
you could summon a guy like me.
85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,640
It’s…it’s true…
I really truly summoned you…
86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,760
Believe it!
87
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,470
You jerk frog!
88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Huh…?
89
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,310
You’ve been condescending to me
90
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,390
and saying whatever you
please since earlier on!
91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Since I summoned you,
I’m your master!
92
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,100
Huh…? What was that?
93
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,350
Hey, who do you think
you’re talking to?!
94
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
A little squirt like you,
95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,760
who isn’t even able to exchange cups
of sake as a pledge of friendship,
96
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,020
is saying to Lord Gamabunta,
that you’re his master?
97
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,930
I could kill you for that! Hey!
98
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,350
Huh…
99
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,930
Oohhh…
100
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,890
It looks like he emerged on top,
that Gamabunta…
101
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,850
Awesome…
102
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,760
I hate to tell you this, little brat,
103
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,020
but even if I were to concede
a hundred steps to you…
104
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
No, concede a thousand steps to you,
105
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,810
and even if it really was true that
it was you who summoned me…
106
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,140
If you’re the kind of guy who
falls off my back that easily,
107
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,020
there’s no way I could
admit you as my master…
108
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,760
Huh?! Huh…?!
109
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,760
Now then…I’m here in the
free world after a long time…
110
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,180
If Jiraiya doesn’t have
any business with me,
111
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,100
I think I’ll kick back for a while.
112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,100
Hey! Wait!
113
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,640
Why don’t you just go home
and sleep or something?
114
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,640
’Cause it looks like you’re incapable
of serving even as my henchman.
115
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,350
Darn it!
116
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,810
W-What the heck do you think
you’re doing, you little brat?
117
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,310
If my making you recognize that
I summoned you
118
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,390
depends on my not falling
off your back, then…!
119
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,680
Then I won’t get off your back
the entire day today no matter what!
120
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,020
What?!
121
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,760
And by my doing that I’ll make
you recognize me as your master!
122
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,640
You little brat! Don’t get all carried away
thinking I’ll go easy on you!
123
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,850
Huh?!
124
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,760
Fall!
125
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,970
Chakra adhesion!
126
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
There’s not enough Chakra!
127
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Listen carefully, Chief Toad!
128
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,390
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
129
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,270
I’m a man who will become Hokage
in the future. Don’t forget that!
130
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,270
Who cares!
131
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,930
This is getting pretty interesting.
132
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,270
Hey!
133
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,760
Oh my gosh!
134
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
Sorry Naruto,
but I’ve gotta get back to work!
135
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,600
Research…research…
136
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,310
Bust off!
137
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,760
Welcome!
138
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,350
I'm gonna eat my fill.
139
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,470
Huh... Those guys are
eathing barbecue again, huh?
140
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
A reward for having trained
earnestly…maybe?
141
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,350
I thought you were told not to
let Gaara out of your sight…
142
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,390
Don’t worry…
even somebody like him…
143
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,970
wouldn’t dare to do anything
in broad daylight.
144
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,930
More importantly,
that guy Shikamaru or whatever,
145
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,390
he’s the first guy
you’re fighting, right?
146
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,060
Shouldn’t you be formulating
a battle plan?
147
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Humph… There’s no way I would
lose to a guy of that level…
148
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,850
Besides…
149
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,220
You botched it, didn’t you?
150
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,850
Huh?
151
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,390
If you had taken the exam
one year earlier,
152
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,810
you would have made
the Chunin easily…
153
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,350
Don’t say it…
154
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,720
What was that?!
155
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,100
The upcoming Chunin Exam…
156
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,520
I’ll have the three of you from
our Sand Village take the exam…
157
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,760
But the reason for doing that
is not to pass the Chunin Exam!
158
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,850
It is to use the opportunity
of the Chunin Exam…
159
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,600
to crush Leaf Village!
160
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,760
But why…? Don’t we have
a treaty with Leaf Village?!
161
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,430
That treaty is the problem.
162
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,060
Oh.
163
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,350
What do you mean?
164
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,520
You Genin are not aware of
the detail but…
165
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
At the time the treaty was concluded,
166
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,060
that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind
not only aggressively scaled down
167
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,470
the arsenal of
the Hidden Sand Village…
168
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,390
he delegated to the Leaf Village
169
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,930
matters that should have been handled
by our country, and moreover,
170
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:14,220
significantly cut our country's budget
and slashed the number of Shinobi.
171
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,390
When we have an idiot leader,
172
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,850
we, the arms and legs
of the country, suffer.
173
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,560
The only choice we had left
was to improve the quality
174
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,350
of each and every Shinobi in order
to maintain our country’s military power…
175
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,350
That’s why Shinobi like
you were created…
176
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,760
Gaara…
177
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,720
The Land of Wind’s security is
in extreme danger right now!
178
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
But the aides
of that idiot feudal lord…
179
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
don’t have a clue!
180
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,060
Lord Kazekage ,
181
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,270
who detected the weakening in the military
strength of the Hidden Sand Village,
182
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,680
joined hands with
the Hidden Sound Village
183
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,470
and decided to take down
the Hidden Leaf Village…
184
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,100
In addition to restoring Sand
Village authority…
185
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,760
this needs to be done in order
to make that idiot feudal lord
186
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,270
aware of the importance of
crisis preparedness…
187
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
If any more time passes,
our Sand Village will totally lose
188
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,060
its military capabilities
against the Leaf Village …
189
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,270
Now is the only chance …
190
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,100
The success of that mission…
Gaara…depends on your work…
191
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,810
Yeah…
192
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,770
If the strategy is carried out,
193
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,930
it will certainly lead to war
with the Leaf Village.
194
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,310
We’ll be at war again…?
195
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,760
The cost to human life in implementing
the treaty was very great…
196
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,810
and if it is broken…then again…
many people will die…
197
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,810
H-Hey…Temari…
198
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,430
This is the will of Lord Kazekage.
199
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,020
Of Lord Kazekage?
200
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,470
After all, Shinobi are simply
tools for fighting.
201
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,680
The treaty did nothing more than
jeopardize our very existence.
202
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,270
This is a super A-rank mission.
203
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,560
See it through with great care!
204
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,850
Okay.
205
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,020
Yes…
206
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,430
A day sure is long when
one’s not doing anything.
207
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,140
I guess…
208
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,890
Darn… What an obstinate little squirt.
209
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,100
Goodness…that Naruto seems
like he’s in agony…
210
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,060
He must have exhausted
most of his Chakra
211
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,470
when he summoned Gamabunta…
212
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,760
Look, look, isn’t that pretty…
213
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,770
The rainbow…
214
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,770
Gorgeous…
215
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,930
Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn’t it.
216
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,760
Good work, Baki.
217
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,560
Lord Kazekage, I successfully
moved all three pawns
218
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,760
to the real battle as planned.
219
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,760
The agreement with the Sound Village side
has been progressing with no problem too.
220
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,680
Yes, sir.
221
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,350
This is…
222
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,760
A decisive action plan from
the Sound Village.
223
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,850
You still have something you want?
224
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,310
Well…
225
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,760
What is it? Come out with it.
226
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,220
Yes, sir…I was wondering if you
could position some soldiers
227
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,760
near the border on the pretext of
undertaking a tactical exercise.
228
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,100
With only the four of us…
229
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
The Leaf Village isn’t idiot either.
230
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,760
Their Anbu black ops
are moving about.
231
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,760
If we do that, they will see right through
what we’re contemplating.
232
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,140
But with only our current
military capability…
233
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,220
That’s why I sent Gaara and
the others out there.
234
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:57,470
The restoration of the authority of
the Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.
235
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,180
Well… Go.
236
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,850
Yes, sir.
237
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,890
There’s only a little more time remaining
until the sun sets completely…
238
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,270
and if I don’t fall off…
239
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,760
I’ll be the master!
240
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,720
What’s that to me?!
241
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,390
You came up with this
whole thing unilaterally.
242
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,930
I’m not falling off, no matter what!
243
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,850
That Naruto…
he’s already way past his limit…
244
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,760
I wouldn’t be surprised if
he fell off any minute now…
245
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,760
I could simply ignore what
a brat like him says…
246
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,760
but taking a lick really irritates me.
247
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,140
I'm gonna bring this
to an end once and for all...
248
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,770
Hey, brat…what’s your name?
249
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,220
Naruto!
250
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,270
It’s Naruto Uzumaki!
251
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,560
Naruto Uzumaki… Naruto!
252
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,470
Don’t hold it against me if you die!
253
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,270
Oh…
254
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,100
That Gamabunta!
255
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,760
Now it’s a matter of pride for him, too!
256
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,060
Huh?!
257
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,270
This won’t do!
258
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,520
No! This is the sizzling young ladies’
entertainment spot!
259
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,100
I’m not falling off when
I’m so close to succeeding!
260
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,520
Hey!
261
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,220
Oh…
262
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,560
What?!
263
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
That Naruto…
264
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,430
He’s squeezing out yet more Chakra
from that condition he’s in.
265
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,180
I’m falling…
266
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,600
How do you like that, Gamabunta?
I’m still on your back!
267
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,640
It’s my victory!
268
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,720
Oh no! If he falls like that he’ll die!
269
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,180
Too bad for you… You almost made it.
270
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,680
To think that he could hold out like that
against a tough opponent like Gamabunta…
271
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,100
Hm?!
272
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,470
That, Jiraiya, meddling in…
273
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,600
I am fully aware of the fact that…
274
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,720
this guy here summoned
me all on his own.
275
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,470
I mean, it’s the first time since
the Fourth Hokage
276
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,060
that somebody climbed on my head.
277
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,600
As might be expected,
he must be totally drained.
278
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,680
I don’t mind dispensing some
of my power to him but…
279
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,930
Taking him to that place would be best.
280
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,850
Huh? What!
281
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,310
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
282
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,760
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
283
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,180
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
284
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,560
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
285
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,850
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
286
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:53,220
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
287
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,060
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
288
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,520
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
289
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,760
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
290
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,140
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
291
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:23,430
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
292
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:30,760
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
293
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:37,350
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
294
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:44,640
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
295
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,020
The hospital room
where there is no one.
296
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
The uninvited visitors…
297
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,720
The childhood phantasms
are repeated in the daydream.
298
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,680
The moment when
the forbidden door is opened…
299
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,060
That guy appears.
300
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,470
Next time, “Hospital Besieged:
The Evil Hand Revealed!”
301
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,720
Who is the next victim?!
//%
1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:09,830
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:18,080
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,380
One more time
4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,080
Are you really happy
5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,630
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?
6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,330
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be
7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,000
Will you always have a great smile?
8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,630
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up
9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:54,870
and someday, I'll live on my own.
10
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,870
Yes, precious things are never in shape
11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,920
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it
12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,080
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength
13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,870
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking
14
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,920
One more time
15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,870
Summoning Jutsu!
16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,710
This time for sure, the frog will…
17
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,750
What’s a frog anyway?!
18
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,870
From which stage do you
call it a frog?!
19
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,870
Live or Die:
Risk it All to Win it All!
20
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,130
Hey! Hold up a hope
on me a bit, would you?!
21
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,290
Whew… he collapsed again…
22
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,880
That’s no surprise…
23
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,500
For three weeks, he’s continued
his training on guts alone…
24
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,960
Lord Hokage.
25
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,790
Anko, is it…?
26
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,710
I’m sorry, I’m...
27
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,750
Regretting returning alive
from the Forest of Death?
28
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,630
That’s a needless thing because you and
Orochimaru have no connection at all.
29
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,750
There is no Shinobi who can compete
against that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.
30
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,630
Even if I was the one to face him…
31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,870
If the Fourth Hokage were still alive…
32
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,960
Don’t say that.
33
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,870
He already saved this village and died…
34
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:38,000
That’s a story from 13 years ago.
He’s no longer here.
35
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,460
We have to do something
with our power.
36
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,960
Yes.
37
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,790
I’m going to get some fesh air…
38
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,380
Don’t blame yourself.
39
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,870
C’mon, open your eyes already.
40
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,830
W-What’s that…?
41
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,630
To be clear, you have no sense.
42
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,670
Oh! Pervy Sage!
43
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,460
After you’ve been training for 3 weeks,
you are still this level.
44
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,040
If you continue like this it’s pointless.
45
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,460
That’s not how it is!
I’m doing this with all my might!
46
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,080
I understand that, if you really want
to succeed at Summoning Jutsu,
47
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,130
you have to do it like you’re going
to die or it’s no good at all.
48
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,870
That’s what I’m doing!
49
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,170
I drill my Chakra every day
like I’m going to die.
50
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,420
If you have time to complain about it,
teach me a trick or something!
51
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,830
A trick, huh… A trick.
52
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,960
What?! You’re going to teach me?
53
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
You need to risk your life on it.
54
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,540
L-Life…?
55
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,750
It’s not a joke.
Even so, will you do it?
56
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,290
O-Of course!
I always risk my life!
57
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,870
I see…
58
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,870
Huh…?
59
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,870
Well then, follow me.
60
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,960
What are we doing at a place like this?
61
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,920
You’re not gonna peek again,
are you?
62
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,210
Well, that would be nice,
but today it’s a bath.
63
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,000
First, we purify our bodies…
64
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,130
Huh?
65
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,870
There’s something strange going on…
66
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,870
This is such a nice bath.
67
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,500
Like heaven… Truly heavenly…
68
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,040
Hey, Pervy Sage.
69
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,870
I’m Toad Sage.
70
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,330
Whatever, but how are taking
a bath and Summoning related?
71
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,870
Hey, hey, hey, hey--!
72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,960
What is it?!
73
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,790
Hey, Naruto.
74
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,830
Huh?
75
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,630
Is there something you want to eat?
76
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,580
I’m going to eat!
77
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,540
It’s good! If the training is like this,
I’ll do it every day!
78
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,250
Eat up! Because this is the last…
79
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,960
Huh?
80
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,040
No, nothing. Anyway, eat!
Eat a lot!
81
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,870
Like there’s no looking back!
82
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,500
I don’t know what’s going on,
but I should eat, right? Okay!
83
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,870
Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!
84
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,870
Gotcha!
85
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,290
One more!
86
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,420
Coming right up!
87
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,960
This time miso char siu!
88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,870
Yeah!
89
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,040
I ate, I ate.
90
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,210
Thank you, Pervy Sage…
91
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,870
What?!
92
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
Thanks for your patronage!
93
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,420
I won’t even get blood from it…
94
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,870
Yo, are you full?
95
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,870
Don’t mess with me, Pervy Sage!
96
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,870
Weren’t you treating me
with the meal!
97
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,040
Fool! Who said that
I was treating you?!
98
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,170
Aren’t you a grown-up?! Bastard!
99
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,790
By the by, Naruto,
isn’t there a girl that you like?
100
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,170
Huh?
101
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,870
I asked if you have a lovely girl?
102
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,380
Well…you could say she’s there,
you could say I like her…
103
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,210
You could say it’s Sakura.
104
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,420
So there is?
105
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,170
It’s Sakura!
106
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,960
Okay! Then go and
hug that girl tight!
107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,500
What?!
108
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,880
Is that a part of the training?
109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, close enough.
110
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,870
Okay! Right away…
111
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,870
But if I do that, Sakura will…
112
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,500
No! This is training too!
I have to do it or I won’t be strong…
113
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,750
But if I do that, Sakura will…
114
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,420
For a while she won’t talk to me…
115
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,580
No! If I’m going to master
Summoning Jutsu,
116
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,040
this can’t be helped!
117
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,540
But…Sakura will…
118
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,000
No! But…
119
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,130
Hurry up and go!
120
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,130
What do you want?
121
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,170
No, uh…well…
122
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,040
If it’s money you want,
I won’t lend it to you.
123
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,870
I may not look it,
but I’m stingy with money.
124
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
No, that’s not it…
125
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,540
Well…
126
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,210
Uh, if I tell her it’s for my training,
she’s sure to beat me.
127
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,870
If there’s nothing you want,
then I ’ll go home.
128
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,580
W-Wait a minute!
129
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Oh…
130
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,460
This is it!
This is my chance!
131
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,670
Sakura! I’m sorry!
132
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,870
Hey!
133
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,420
What are you doing?!
134
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,250
Cha!
135
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,250
Ow… Ouch…
136
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,540
This is a part of being young…
137
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,750
Hey, if I do this I’ll really get a frog?
138
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,630
Yes, that’s a definite.
139
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,210
Really…?
140
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,790
Is there anything you’ve left undone?
141
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,790
Huh?
142
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,580
None?
143
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,710
What are you talking about…?
144
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,580
To pull out enormous Chakra
and use it.
145
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,330
It is certain that it is difficult
to have the control to do it…
146
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,670
It is also certain that this body
is a vessel too small
147
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,920
to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…
148
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,750
It’s likely that Naruto’s body normally
tends to reject
149
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,040
the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox
in order to avoid too much strain.
150
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,870
If the excitement of danger and
emotion are the key
151
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,670
to drawing out the
Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…
152
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,380
he has to learn physically until
he can automatically use that key.
153
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,290
Nothing personal…
Fourth Hokage!
154
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,460
Huh? Where…is this…?
155
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,170
Stand up!
156
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,290
W-What’s going on?!
157
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,000
Your training ends here.
158
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,330
Huh? I haven’t done anything yet…!
159
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,250
Naruto!
160
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,870
Go die and come back.
161
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,380
Die?
162
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,130
From within the dreadfulness of death,
squeeze out enormous Chakra!
163
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,870
Experience it with your own body,
and grasp the technique of it!
164
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,960
If you don’t want to die,
do something about it yourself… Got it?
165
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,630
Now…we’ll see if the strength given
to you is really yours.
166
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,040
If I don’t grab onto this… I’ll die!
167
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,460
Now!
168
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,330
It’s impossible…
169
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,210
This rock surface is slippery
from the seepage of the waterfall.
170
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,870
Besides, falling in that speed
with the control of Chakra that you have,
171
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,210
you can’t cling to the rock.
172
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,080
Naruto, after this…
173
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,580
you can only depend on
the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
174
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,960
Open up the key…
This time from your side!
175
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,420
If I go on like this!
lf I go on like this! I’ll seriously die!
176
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,710
Die!
177
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,870
Die…
178
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,750
Today, we’ll have
a history lesson outside.
179
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,210
As you know, this rock face has
the faces of the Hokage line.
180
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,670
In order from the left,
they’re lined up fom the First,
181
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:43,000
the Second…
the Third…and the Fourth.
182
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,130
So different from the present old man.
183
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,960
Especially the receding hairline…
184
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,000
Iruka Sensei! Who’s the Fifth?
185
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,130
Hmm?
186
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,080
Well, that hasn’t been decided yet…
187
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,870
Perhaps it’s your teacher here!
188
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:12,000
Hmm… Weaving an occasional joke
to make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?
189
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,710
L-Lord Hokage!
190
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,920
Oh, it’s the Third.
191
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,790
Hey! Old man!
What did you come to do?
192
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,420
I wanted to see the rock faces too.
193
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,870
You’ve come at a good time.
Over this way, my lord.
194
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,870
This is the real man of
the third rock face!
195
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,870
The Third Hokage!
196
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,040
The third was called the strongest,
a genius,
197
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,500
called “professor” among
past Hokage!
198
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,130
– What?! 					– Huh?!
199
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,870
Hey! Iruka, don’t say it
in the past tense.
200
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,870
S-Sorry.
201
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,290
Are you really strong?
202
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,880
Yeah, you don’t look it!
203
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,420
Yep! That’s right!
204
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,210
Enough!
205
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,920
To take over the name of Hokage
means you’re the strongest in this village!
206
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,710
Okay! I’m going to become
the Fifth Hokage!
207
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,210
After all I’m really strong,
and handsome too!
208
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,870
It won’t work with
the scores you have now!
209
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,460
You’ve got a lot of confidence!
210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,380
You all are quite young,
unlike me!
211
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,460
There might be someone who will
take the name of Hokage is in this group.
212
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,870
You only have one life!
213
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,170
Don’t choose an impossible road.
214
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,750
It doesn’t matter if you live as
you like and die as you like.
215
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,630
However…
216
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,000
no matter what route you take,
217
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,210
remember to protect the
people important to you!
218
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,040
Important people?
219
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,080
That you acknowledge…
trust and love from your heart.
220
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,630
Do you have people like that?
221
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,870
Y-Yeah… Dad and Mom…
222
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,870
and I hate him a little,
but my big brother too.
223
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,330
And… 					my dog Gonta…
224
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,630
For me, it’s friends!
225
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,630
Me too!
226
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,170
Lord Hokage, you have
people like that too?
227
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, of course I do!
228
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,420
Really! Who, who?
229
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,790
I have my grandchild…
Konohamaru over there and…
230
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,710
All of the people in this village!
231
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,870
Like you did too, once…
232
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,580
Huh?!
233
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,870
This feeling… It’s that Chakra…
234
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,080
This is…
235
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,000
Seal
236
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,540
I-It’s huge… What is it?
237
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey kid, come closer!
238
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,250
I want to eat and kill you,
but this gate won’t open…
239
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,630
Bloody spell that seals…
240
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,170
You're…
241
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,000
the Nine-Tailed Fox!
242
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,920
I see… the red Chakra
was this guy’s Chakra.
243
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,040
For you to approach me…
244
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,130
What business brought you here?
245
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,170
Hey! You stupid fox!
246
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:17,870
Since you’re staying in my body,
as your rent, lend me your Chakra!
247
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,630
After all, if you die I die.
248
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,630
That’s some impressive courage
for threatening me!
249
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,040
That’s fine…
250
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,380
As a reward for making it this far…
I’ll give it to you!
251
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,710
This is the feeling!
252
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,580
Summoning Jutsu!
253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,870
Well done.
254
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,870
Where am I?!
255
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,420
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
256
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,870
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
257
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,290
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry
258
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,670
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
259
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,960
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
260
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,330
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
261
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,170
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships
262
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,630
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
263
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,870
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
264
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,250
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!
265
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,540
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
266
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,870
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
267
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,460
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too
268
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,750
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
269
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,790
Yay! This time for sure,
I’ve finally brought out the real toad.
270
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,710
Listen, you giant toad,
I am your master from today!
271
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,290
Huh? No, nothing.
272
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,170
I will be your henchman, boss.
273
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,870
I’m so happy…
274
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,750
Next time, "He Flies! He Jumps!
He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!"
275
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,670
He’s seriously scary.
I’ve never seen a toad like this one.
//%
1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,190
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,090
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,200
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,960
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,140
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,170
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,450
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,020
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,410
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,210
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,380
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,720
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,550
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,520
At this point in time,
21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,560
I don’t even plan to fight
over Sasuke with you.
22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,460
Sakura!
23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Do you know who
you’re lipping off to?!
24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,930
Don’t press your luck,
crybaby Sakura!
25
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,540
It seems like...
it seems like Sakura was out of line!
26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,910
Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.
She’s scary.
27
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,540
Hmm.
28
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,310
That's not it…
29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,780
Huh?
30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,010
Sakura’s not the kind of kid
to do things
31
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,750
like needlessly flaunt her
own power and hurt people.
32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,860
She doesn’t like having Ino
taking pity on her and pulling punches.
33
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,210
– This time for sure,
– This time for sure,
34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,810
– with full strength,
– with full strength,
35
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,980
– a fair... fight!
– a fair... fight!
36
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,560
The Ultimate Battle: Cha!
37
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,540
Just a Clone Jutsu…?!
38
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,710
This isn’t a Ninja Academy’s
graduation exam!
39
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,010
You think you can beat me…
40
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,920
with a textbook ninja art?!
41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,190
If I look carefully, I can find out,
which is the real one right away…
42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,920
Chakra to my feet at a burst…Then…
43
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,390
repel off the ground!
44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,130
Fast!
45
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,530
If you think I’m the crybaby Sakura
I was until recently,
46
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,800
you’ll get your fingers burned!
47
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,940
Come like you mean it, Ino!
48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,540
I appreciate you saying that…
49
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,250
I’ll go like I mean it, as you wish!
50
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,560
Way to go Sakura!
51
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,560
Great!
52
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,190
Really great!
53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
With the fundamental movements
using Chakra,
54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,300
she’s topnotch among the rookies…
55
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,130
Huh?
56
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,530
Sakura is at her best.
57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,000
That means…
ls she better than me?
58
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,070
Well!
59
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,110
That’s right.
60
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,570
Awww!
61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,550
Sending Chakra all throughout
the body and
62
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,180
using the technique
with it at a right timing…
63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,420
Those techniques alone
are better than Sasuke.
64
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,650
Well, from the start,
she was extremely good at…
65
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,560
controlling her Chakra, so…
66
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,560
Magnificent movements, Sakura!
67
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,880
However, her opponent is good too.
68
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,850
This evenly-matched battle
looks to take awhile!
69
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,820
Since when did this girl
get this strong?!
70
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,990
I can make it, too…!
71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
You little…!
72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,840
Whoa!
73
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,940
At this rate, it’ll never end.
74
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,810
This is long…
75
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,850
They’ve been going at it
for ten minutes, at the least.
76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,200
You shouldn’t be evenly
matched with me!
77
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,540
What makes you think
I’m evenly matched with you…
78
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,540
who’s only concerned with looks
and growing your hair frivolously?!
79
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,540
You!
80
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,110
You carry your mocking
of me too far!
81
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,480
Idiot.
82
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,550
She’s going for the bait.
83
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,050
Who knows what Ino will do!
84
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,060
I don’t like Ino when she’s that way…!
85
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,310
You’re simple-minded…
86
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,350
Uh-oh.
87
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,550
She’s totally lost it!
88
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,150
I don’t need this!
89
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,800
S-Scary…
90
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,460
I’ll put an end to this right now!
91
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,600
I’ll make you say that you lost!
92
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,710
Hey, don’t tell me…
93
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,410
Could it be…?
94
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,750
As I recall, that Sign is…
95
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,550
I knew it…
96
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,150
She’s planning to do
the Mind Transfer Jutsu!
97
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,650
Man…That idiot!
98
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,090
I understand your feelings of frustration,
but that’s futile.
99
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,230
Humph!
100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,130
I wonder!
101
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,170
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu…
102
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,540
A Jutsu where the user can take
over the opponent’s spirit
103
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,810
and wrest their body away
for a few minutes…
104
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,540
by discharging all of
their own spiritual energy
105
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,940
and striking the enemy with it.
106
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,550
But, there are major flaws
to this formidable Jutsu.
107
00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,690
First, the discharged spiritual energy
can only fly straight and at a slow speed.
108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,170
Second, even in the case of failing
to hit the enemy and missing,
109
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,670
the user can’t return to her
own body for several minutes.
110
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,810
I should add that during
that interval, the user’s,
111
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,640
in other words, your main body
will turn into a doll that won’t move at all!
112
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,650
In the first place,
113
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,550
the Mind Transfer Jutsu is used
for spying and is not a Jutsu for battle.
114
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,560
Ino, using that Jutsu here
would be equal to suicide…
115
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,060
It shouldn’t be particularly
scary if she moves about…
116
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,430
And not only that,
if she dodges the Jutsu,
117
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,600
she can beat the heck out
of the non-moving opponent.
118
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,840
If that happens, Hayate will be forced
to put an end to the match…
119
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,340
So what?!
120
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,570
I won’t know unless I try!
121
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,540
If you miss, it’s over.
122
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,550
You know that, right?
123
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,550
In the first place,
it’s a combination Jutsu to be used
124
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,650
after stopping the opponent’s
movements during a battle
125
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,920
with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.
126
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,560
There’s no way!
127
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,960
There is no way, it will hit…
128
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,830
Idiot! Stop!
129
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,800
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
130
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,550
Which one…?
131
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,500
That was unfortunate…
132
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,400
Ino.
133
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,740
Has the fat lady sung…?
134
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,540
She went and did it…
135
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,370
Then, it’s over, eh.
136
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,680
This is…?!
137
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,190
You fell for it, Sakura!
138
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,360
I finally caught you!
139
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,260
It can't be!
140
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,600
Yes, it can.
141
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,970
My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,
142
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,570
to drive you who was running
about into this contrivance.
143
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,310
So?
144
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,540
You can’t move at all, can you?
145
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,210
It’s special rope that’s my hair
with Chakra poured in!
146
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,560
With this, it will be over when
I enter your body and say “give up!”
147
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,560
It wouldn’t miss
a hundred percent of the time!
148
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,600
I see…
149
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,130
That idiot… Her losing it
was also an act?
150
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,270
Get out of there, Sakura!
151
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,540
I can’t move…!
152
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,470
Then…
153
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,540
Mind Transfer Jutsu!
154
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,830
That was unfortunate…
155
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,540
She missed!
156
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,210
No!
157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,540
Sakura…
158
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,110
Sakura!
159
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,650
Sakura!
160
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,840
W-What’s with Ino?
161
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,570
Also... Sakura’s acting kind of strange!
Believe it!
162
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,940
But…surely this is her chance!
163
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,610
Do it, Sakura!
164
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,850
It’s no use.
165
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,980
To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there…
166
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,590
Sakura’s had it.
167
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,360
Mind Transfer…?!
168
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,830
That means Sakura right now is…
169
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,430
Yes.
170
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,430
Sakura’s spirit has been
completely taken over by Ino.
171
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,870
What?!
172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,840
Ino is inside of Sakura’s body now!
173
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,410
Well.
174
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,940
Ino’s purpose is most likely…
175
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,880
With this, it’s over.
176
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,150
Good bye, Sakura…
177
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,400
I…Sakura Haruno concede…
178
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,240
– this match… 					– No!
179
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,400
Sakura!
180
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,270
Tsk!
181
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,610
He’s annoying!
182
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,280
You did your hardest to get here!
183
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,910
You’ll disgrace women if you lose
to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
184
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,850
Like I said, those words
are useless…
185
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,560
What's...
186
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,560
this bad chill…?!
187
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,540
Naruto is annoying!
188
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,550
Anyway, that’s right…
not to Ino I won’t …
189
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,650
Sakura?!
190
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,880
This can’t be happening…
191
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,550
What’s the matter?
192
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,820
Are you conceding?
193
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,400
I won’t be conceding!
194
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,100
No Way!
195
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,730
Cha!
196
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,340
Which is it?
197
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,440
W-What’s going on?!
198
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,670
Sakura…?!
199
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,710
No way!
200
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,550
I messed up my Jutsu…?
201
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:38,160
Ino…You’ll have a terrible time of it
if you don’t get out of me quick!
202
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
What’s wrong, with Ino?
203
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,770
No… I won’t hold on at this rate…
204
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,640
Release!
205
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,500
It can’t be…
She shattered Ino’s Jutsu!
206
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,070
She used too much energy
before the Jutsu…
207
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,500
So she didn’t have enough Chakra…?!
208
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,710
To think she has two spirits…
What are you?!
209
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,150
Strength that ranks with beauty.
210
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,520
Girls can’t survive if they’re not tough!
211
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,930
If caught in that spell,
212
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,260
it’s not that easy to cast out
the invader…
213
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,430
Ino’s lack of Chakra…
214
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,170
There’s also that…
215
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,600
But what was more effective
than that…
216
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,540
was the combative spirit towards
lno she has inside her heart.
217
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:10,380
So that was awakened with Naruto’s voice
as the trigger and she cast Ino out…?
218
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,880
There’s nothing to it.
219
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,580
Like Naruto…
220
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,020
Sakura’s fighting spirit was
much stronger than others.
221
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
– This is…! 					– This is…!
222
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,600
But, both of them should
have hardly any Chakra left.
223
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,070
– This is… 					– This is…
224
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,100
– the end! 					– the end!
225
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,340
Both parties are unable
to continue the match!
226
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,680
By double knockout,
227
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,210
no one gets through the
fourth battle of the preliminary!
228
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,220
– What?! 					– Huh?!
229
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,920
Now then...
230
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Good grief.
231
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,130
Hey, Ino!
232
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,390
Sakura!
233
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,560
Sakura!
234
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,930
A-A-Are you okay?!
235
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,150
Treatment’s not necessary.
236
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,550
They’ll probably wake up after awhile.
237
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,160
But, that was surprising…
238
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,090
Yeah…
239
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,260
Naruto and Sasuke aside…
240
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,730
to think even that Sakura who didn’t
have what it took has grown this much…
241
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,800
A lot happened,
242
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,140
but I really feel like it
was a good thing…
243
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,440
sending her to this Chunin Exam.
244
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,160
Tenten vs. Temari
245
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,230
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
246
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,560
Now…
247
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,770
The second one from the
Land of Sand, huh…
248
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,900
– This looks to be an interesting match.
– Do your best, Tenten!
249
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,320
It looks like you finally
woke up, eh…Sakura.
250
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,550
Huh?!
251
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Tenten, power of youth!
252
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,820
Go Go!
253
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,190
There is no limit to your youth!
254
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,760
Our match is already over.
255
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,270
Did I…lose?
256
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,540
I’m the one who wants to cry…
257
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,380
To think I tied with somebody like you…
258
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,420
Huh?
259
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,580
Here!
260
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,320
You also got a flower to bloom, didn’t you?
261
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,460
A beautiful flower!
262
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,900
Ino…
263
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
However...
264
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,550
the next time we fight,
265
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,550
it won’t end with you
getting knocked out!
266
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,550
Hm…?!
267
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,920
And… I won’t hand over
Sasuke to you!
268
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,890
I return the same line to you!
269
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,430
– Humph! 					– Humph!
270
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,670
The fifth battle…
271
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,100
Tenten, Temari…
come forward!
272
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,330
Hey, can you hear it?
273
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:31,640
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
274
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:41,480
The ocean spans limitlessly
275
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:49,550
Please keep that smile on your face forever
276
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,560
Or else I’ll cry
277
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,460
You won't have to search around you
278
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,100
It’s all ok now.
279
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:12,940
Everyone is inside
this hand
280
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,520
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
281
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,850
When you forget what happiness is
282
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,660
Just sing.
283
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,130
Light is born, and darkness was born
284
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,460
The two are one
285
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,670
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
286
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,440
Hey, can you hear it?
287
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,180
You know! You know!
288
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,520
I feel like women battles
are incredible, or…
289
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,090
Women are scary.
290
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,820
Huh?
291
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,820
Hey-hey!
292
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
This isn’t the time to be
withdrawing, Shikamaru.
293
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,460
You’re kind of a plain, or a lousy,
or an unimpressive guy, aren’t you?
294
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,870
If you don’t really put your whole heart
into it, things will get hairy for you.
295
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,970
Next episode:
“Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru”
296
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,840
This is really, seriously bad!

Hit it straight like a line drive!

Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,170
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,000
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:44,300
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,670
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,960
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,550
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

20
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,250
As for me…
I stand by my words.
21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,880
That’s…my Way of Ninja!
22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,130
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing!
23
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,210
Just get out of the way!
Run away!
24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,790
Just like our wager,
25
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,790
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.
26
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,790
I…
27
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,170
I will absolutely not die
until I’ve become Hokage!
28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,790
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!
29
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,630
I-It can’t be…
30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,960
The Fifth Hokage!
A Life on the Line!
31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,210
Rasengan!
32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,210
This is…?!
33
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,710
Way to go, Naruto.
34
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,130
That Nine-Tailed Fox kid…
35
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,790
a kid like that,
doing a technique like that…
36
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,790
I-It can’t be…
37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,500
He can’t be, really…
38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,420
In only one week,
that Rasengan…
39
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,750
You… Even after you received
that Jutsu…?!
40
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,750
I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,
41
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,670
and before I received the Jutsu
I had started healing.
42
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,790
The reason why Orochimaru favors me…
43
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,420
is not because of my use of Jutsu
or my sense for Jutsu…
44
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,840
It is because my recuperative power.
45
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,170
The power to energize cells
and make new cells.
46
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,710
On the other hand…
I’ve used up almost all of my Chakra.
47
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,380
That Jutsu…
seems it was Naruto’s last effort…
48
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,960
Wh-What?!
49
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,590
I-It can’t be…
50
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,790
Even with my powers of recuperation,
this much damage.
51
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,790
I don’t…have…enough Chakra.
52
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,000
Arrhythmia!
53
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,840
Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters…
54
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,130
Why did that happen…?
55
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,460
That moment?!
56
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,710
At that moment of release…
57
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,420
did he shred the muscles
around his heart…?
58
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,550
Stop shaking!
59
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,790
Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.
60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,790
Are we really getting a snack?
That guy looks like he’s going to die.
61
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,590
You’re annoying! Be quiet!
62
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,420
It’s all over…for Naruto.
63
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:45,090
I…cut…his heart’s Chakra Network
which restores the strength…
64
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,460
through the Nine-Tail’s Chakra…
65
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,790
With all my strength.
66
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,880
In order to eliminate the possibility
that he would heal with his own power.
67
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,170
There's no way he can recover…
68
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,840
Even with you.
69
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Shut up!
70
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,790
I’ll kill you later…
71
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,840
He’s stopped breathing…!
72
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Dammit!
73
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,050
Dammit!
74
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,790
Dammit!
75
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,880
It’s dark…
76
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,790
Dark…
77
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,250
Why is it getting dark?
78
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,710
My strength is… Why…?
79
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,090
What…?
80
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,630
Don’t die…
81
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,670
Don’t die!
82
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,790
Don’t die!
83
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,790
Don’t die!
84
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,670
Don’t die!
85
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,800
The bet…
86
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,960
I won it.
87
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,050
I-It’s impossible…
88
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,800
“Hokage is…my dream,” eh?
89
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,170
For the last time…
90
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,250
For the last time…
91
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,590
Just one more time…
92
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,800
I want to bet on you…
93
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,460
That child, he’s not well…
94
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,130
Tsunade is a medical specialist.
95
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,790
Don’t worry, there’s no need to
worry about Naruto’s body.
96
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,920
That’s not what I meant.
97
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,170
What?
98
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,500
Your battle is with me,
there’s no time to look away.
99
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,710
Who would have imagined this?
100
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,500
If that child is found by the Akatsuki,
there will be trouble.
101
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,500
In other words,
if I'm to kill him…
102
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,550
now is the time!
103
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,790
Shoot!
104
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,960
He’s aiming at this child!
105
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,380
Tsunade… You’re the only one
I wasn’t going to kill…
106
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,420
If that child lives,
107
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:27,340
there will be trouble in the future
on a variety of levels.
108
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,590
Don’t get in my way.
109
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,460
This is one child…
110
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,750
This is one child…
I will absolutely protect!
111
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,550
Trembling at the sight of blood,
why would you, one of the Sannin,
112
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,460
risk your life to protect that Genin kid?
113
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,050
To protect…
114
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,250
my hometown…the Leaf Village…!
115
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,500
To protect the Leaf Village…?
116
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,590
Because…because…
117
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,550
this small child…
118
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,210
is the kid who will become
Hokage some day…
119
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,380
What utter nonsense…
120
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,670
By the way…
to hell with Hokage!
121
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,590
Only a fool does that job.
122
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,050
To hell with Hokage!
Only a fool does that job.
123
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,710
The wishes of the two…
124
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,710
More importantly, Lady Tsunade,
your wish…
125
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,300
Have you forgotten your dream?
126
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,920
The successive lines of Hokage
have protected
127
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,420
the Leaf Village and
and those living in it.
128
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,500
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.
129
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,300
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!
130
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,790
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage…
131
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,090
It doesn’t matter if
you are a woman!
132
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I’ll clobber you with all my might!
133
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,750
And now,
I also will put my life on the line!
134
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,300
If your life is worth throwing away
for a kid like him… !
135
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,090
Then dying now would be
a fitting end!
136
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,550
All that’s left…is Naruto.
137
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,590
Lady Tsunade!
138
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,340
Make it in time!
139
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,790
She’s still able to move even
after I pierced her down to her lungs!
140
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,960
You mean you’ll still protect that kid?!
141
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,300
That’s what I said…
142
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
From now…
143
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,670
I’m putting my life on the line!
144
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,050
You, half-dead corpse!
145
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,790
No matter how cool you try to be,
your trembling doesn’t stop.
146
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,210
You can’t get away from
the curse of hemophobia.
147
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,130
And yet, why would you
take the blows for that kid?
148
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,790
Why would you battle for the Leaf?
149
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,800
No way!
150
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,250
Tsunade’s trembling has…
151
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,840
has stopped?
152
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,790
That is because…I am…
153
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,090
the Leaf Village’s…Fifth Hokage!
154
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,790
That sign is?!
155
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,790
Lady Tsunade has conquered
her fear of blood,
156
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,090
but that’s…
157
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,790
What are you saying you’ll do,
after all this time?
158
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,790
You can’t fight with that wound
even if you’ve conquered your fear.
159
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:57,500
W-Wait! I’ll treat that wound.
So don’t release that seal!
160
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,420
Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!
161
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,130
Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!
162
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,090
What is this Jutsu…?!
163
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,920
It looks like I’m not the only one
who develops new Jutsu.
164
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,710
What in the world is this Jutsu?
165
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,130
Well…
166
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,920
For many years I’ve stored Chakra
in my forehead.
167
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,340
The mass of Chakra stimulated
a variety of proteins.
168
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,840
The number of times my cells divide
speeds to a dizzying rate…
169
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,250
The cells rebuild…
170
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,170
and all the organs and body systems
are revitalized.
171
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,090
It’s not the ability to restore,
it’s the ability to reincarnate.
172
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,300
That means I won’t die…from battles.
173
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,790
But the number of times a person’s cells
divide in their lifetime is fixed…
174
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,050
If that is sped up,
it essentially shortens the life!
175
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,210
Lady Tsunade!
176
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,840
That action is…
177
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,170
Lord Orochimaru!
178
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,550
Come out!
179
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,250
Hurry!
180
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,500
Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!
181
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,590
– Summoning Jutsu!
– Summoning Jutsu!
182
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,790
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
183
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,170
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
184
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,340
On your still shoulder
185
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,960
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
186
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,710
The city lights are like pieces of stars
187
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,460
That hold us together
188
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:58,090
“Each one of us glows differently,”
189
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,790
you say laughingly
190
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,790
but you look most dazzling
191
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,790
Like a comet,
192
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,790
like the rainbow after the storm
193
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:24,960
You bring light into my heart
194
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:35,420
Being lost can be the answer
195
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:44,250
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
196
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,340
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
197
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,590
The time to conclude this long, fateful
confrontation has come, Orochimaru.
198
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,210
You have sunk too deeply into vice.
199
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,790
You are no longer a comrade!
200
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,750
Comrade? How odious.
201
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,210
That word makes me shiver.
202
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,630
I will bring you down!
203
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,000
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!
204
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,790
Next time:
"Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!"
//%
1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,540
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,040
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,660
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,250
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,660
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,660
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,330
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,160
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,450
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,830
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,120
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,700
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,290
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,410
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,000
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,700
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,290
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,500
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,580
Huh? Uh… Excuse me…
21
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,790
Return of the Morning Mist
22
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,990
My mother and my father…
They didn’t have to die.
23
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,910
Because I didn’t have strength,
the whole clan was destroyed.
24
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,910
Everyone was killed…
25
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,250
Darn it…
26
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,080
Morning training is over!
27
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,540
Once I’ve eaten breakfast
28
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,870
I’ll get back to rigorous training!
29
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,370
Old man…
30
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,540
Konohamaru…
31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,620
Yo! Konohomaru.
32
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,990
Naruto.
33
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,830
Have you already resumed studies
at the academy?
34
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,000
N-No, not yet.
35
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,250
The school buildings are damaged,
so we’re all repairing them.
36
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,830
Is that so?
37
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,200
How about you, Naruto?
You’re already training?
38
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,040
Sort of.
39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,540
Wh-What?
40
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,040
What is it?
41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,870
N-No, it’s nothing…
42
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,750
– Hey um…! 					– Hey um…!
43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,660
So what is it…?
44
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,910
You too, Naruto, what is it?
45
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,620
Nothing…really…
46
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,250
I don’t feel lonely.
47
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:44,990
Huh?
48
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,250
There’s no time to be feeling lonely.
49
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,750
Everyone is working really hard
to rebuild the village right now.
50
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,790
Konohamaru…
51
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,750
Right now, I must work for
the village even just a little bit.
52
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,990
So Naruto, you work hard
at your training too.
53
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,540
If you don’t,
I’ll become Hokage before you.
54
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,660
Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.
55
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,200
Besides…you have to graduate
from the Academy first.
56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
Oh, that’s right…
57
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,990
Oh, here it is.
58
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,370
Here, it’s for you.
59
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,990
A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku…
60
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,990
Is it okay?
61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,500
I already have one,
so I’m giving one to you.
62
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,330
Thank you, Naruto.
63
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,290
Oh! Konohamaru.
64
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,120
Good morning.
65
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,040
I’m going to go.
66
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,910
We’ll work hard again today.
67
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,700
– Yep! 					– Yep!
68
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,990
Today we’re fixing the blackboards.
69
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,990
I brought paint.
70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,330
Well! Once I’ve eaten ramen at Ichiraku,
I’ll continue training.
71
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,120
This is it.
72
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,000
Th-This is…
73
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,450
A lot of time has passed since the death.
74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,080
It’s probably before
the Chunin Exam began.
75
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,790
I see, so that's it…
76
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,450
That Orochimaru!
77
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,160
After the murder of Lord Kazekage,
78
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,870
Orochimaru… or someone
like Kabuto played Kazekage…
79
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,500
How thoughtless we were…
80
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,540
That darn Sarutobi…
81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,990
Well, it’s not that easy.
82
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,540
The one who was your opponent
was the renowned Hokage,
83
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,120
deemed to be strongest of
all five great nations.
84
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,540
However…you’ve done well.
Two out of the five Kages…
85
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,990
Stop…
86
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,830
Stop giving me words of sympathy.
87
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,580
I will kill you!
88
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,410
Of course, I didn’t mean to…
89
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,990
It’s true that we didn’t succeed
in bringing the village down…
90
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,700
On the other hand, another objective
of this plan, Sasuke Uchiha…
91
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,700
Your leash is now on him.
92
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,580
In exchange for these arms
and all of my Jutsu…
93
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,750
If we could have gotten our hands
on that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,
94
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,620
it wouldn’t have been a problem.
95
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,950
However that’s a dream that
can no longer come true.
96
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,990
He is stronger than I am.
97
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,370
That is why…I pulled myself out
from that organization…
98
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,830
Kakashi, huh?
99
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,990
What does he want?
100
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,990
Breakfast, breakfast!
101
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,830
Wait for me, my ramen.
102
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,990
Do you already know
his whereabouts?
103
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,830
Yes.
104
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,370
In that case, it will be easy…
105
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,040
Let’s go.
106
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,990
Here it comes, here it comes.
107
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,990
Oh goodie, it’s just like I thought.
108
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,200
Hidden Leaf Village…
has a high average score.
109
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,410
You’re still doing such
a ridiculous thing?
110
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,330
Well yes, this is my research.
111
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,700
Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?
112
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,160
I wonder what you advisers
want from me.
113
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,620
Surely, you know…
114
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,660
without our telling you, don’t you?
115
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,660
You don’t have to make
such scary faces.
116
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,990
I heard that the talks with Sand Village
have been settled without problems.
117
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,370
The Hidden Village in the Sand
announced that
118
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,580
everything was Orochimaru’s handiwork.
119
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,370
In addition, at the moment of their
complete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,
120
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,330
that wasn’t a very important issue
any more.
121
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,790
Leaf Village has no choice but
to accept their surrender and proposition
122
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,450
in order to restore national power.
123
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,910
However, the current strength of
Leaf Village has dropped drastically.
124
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,830
Under these conditions,
125
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,750
our top priority must be to prepare
for any unpredicted crisis.
126
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,790
We don’t know when any of
the neighboring nations
127
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,790
will come out in a bold move.
128
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,080
Therefore, we’ve decided that until
the village gets its strength back,
129
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,290
we should assemble the top few men
from each troop,
130
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,950
and form an emergency
executive committee to handle this.
131
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
But first…
132
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,330
we need a strong, trustworthy leader.
133
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,990
You can find the seeds of trouble
rolling around everywhere these days.
134
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,040
It’s not just Orochimaru.
135
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,450
You didn’t have to go through
the trouble of informing me that.
136
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,990
Well… I’ll continue gathering materials.
137
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,620
I’m going to tell you the basic plan.
138
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,290
We need the Fifth Hokage right away.
139
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,620
And yesterday at an emergency meeting
with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,
140
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,870
we decided
it would be you, Jiraiya.
141
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,450
I’m sorry, it’s not my nature.
142
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,200
It has been decided.
143
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,120
Besides, if a Shinobi like you,
renowned as a Sannin, is not…
144
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,330
then who is?
145
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,080
If you want a Sannin,
there is one more left…
146
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,950
That Tsunade.
147
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,250
Certainly that child probably
has that capability, but…
148
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,700
However, no one knows where she is.
149
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,620
I’ll find and bring her back.
lf I do that there’s no problem, right?
150
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,250
But…
151
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,990
A wise one like Tsunade is meant to
be Hokage more than I, with no motivation.
152
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,910
What do you want to do?
153
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,990
All right.
We’ll give it urgent consideration.
154
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,250
However, we’ll have three members
from Anbu Black Ops to accompany you
155
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,040
as the search unit for Tsunade.
156
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,990
Don’t worry, I won’t escape from this.
The guards are not necessary.
157
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,290
However…
158
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,580
There is one guy that I want
to take with me on my trip.
159
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,500
I’ve found an interesting egg…
160
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,950
What? That is absolutely strange.
161
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,830
Sorry, but if you don’t have a ticket,
there’s no ramen.
162
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,370
No, wait a minute!
I absolutely had one more.
163
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,990
Huh?
164
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,700
The one that I gave Konohamaru,
was it the last?
165
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,990
Welcome!
166
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,250
Hey, my ramen!
167
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,200
"Racy Violence"
168
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,830
Yo, you two!
169
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,000
You seem to be getting along well.
170
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,370
Fool, Anko asked me to
buy rice dumplings. That’s all.
171
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,330
What are you doing here?
172
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,990
While I’m here to buy offerings,
I’ve made plans to meet here…
173
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,450
with Sasuke.
174
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,160
Huh, it’s rare that you wait for people.
175
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,990
Is the offering to Obito?
176
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,200
Obito?
177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,990
Well…that’s about right.
178
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,870
Kakashi, it’s strange for
you to be here first.
179
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,700
Well… once in a while.
180
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,200
I don’t do natto (fermented beans)
and sweet things.
181
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,370
Oh… Is that so?
182
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,290
What?!
183
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,660
This is absolutely positively strange!
184
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,700
You guys aren’t from the village…
Why in the world did you come?
185
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I haven’t seen you for
a while Asuma, Kurenai.
186
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,500
If you know about us,
are you former Leaf Shinobi?
187
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
– Huh?! 					– Huh?!
188
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,080
Y-You are?!
189
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,540
Humph, without a doubt…
190
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,750
Itachi…
191
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,990
Uchiha.
192
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,700
You are acquaintances of Itachi?
193
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,330
If so…
194
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,700
I’ll introduce myself as well.
195
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,540
I’m Kisame Hoshigaki.
196
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,990
Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.
197
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,990
Never mind later,
I’m going to beat you now!
198
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,660
Itachi…
199
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,750
It seems you’re pretty unpopular
in the village too.
200
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,540
I know you, too.
201
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,620
Kisame Hoshigake,
202
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
originally a Shinobi
of Hidden Village in the Mist.
203
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,080
Suspected of national covert activities
and of killing a feudal lord,
204
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,910
a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water,
on the wanted list in all nations.
205
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,370
You’re a major S-rank criminal
listed in the Bingo Book.
206
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,450
Itachi, you have some nerve
coming back to this village
207
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,330
after causing that awful incident.
208
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
Asuma… Kurenai…
209
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,410
Don’t interfere with me.
210
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,910
I don’t intend to kill you.
211
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,660
That’s not a line for you,
who killed your comrades.
212
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,330
I know there’s no way
you’d come here
213
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,950
without any clear purpose
in those suspicious appearance.
214
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,580
What are you after?
215
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,870
This guy is pretty annoying.
Should we kill him?
216
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,990
It doesn’t look like we are able
to leave the village so smoothly…
217
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,160
But don’t overdo it,
your techniques tend to stand out.
218
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,990
They're done for then.
219
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,990
This is…
220
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,830
Genjutsu.
221
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,290
Pressing down with the tip of his sword…
What strength.
222
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,700
My large sword, Shark Skin…
223
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,830
doesn’t cut, but lops it off!
224
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,790
Kurenai… You’re late.
225
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,990
With this…
226
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,250
it’s over!
227
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,910
Genjutsu of that level doesn’t work on me.
228
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,990
This is…Genjutsu Reversal?
229
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,370
Kurenai!
230
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,950
There’s no time to look away.
231
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,450
That’s what’s expected from you, Kurenai.
232
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,160
But…
233
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,990
“But” this is as far as it goes…
234
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,250
for you.
235
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:42,990
What?!
236
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,990
Water Style!
237
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,990
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
238
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,700
The same Jutsu as me?!
239
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,870
Why have you shown up too?
240
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,080
Well…I asked you to take care
of them earlier.
241
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,080
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
242
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,200
Shadow clones.
243
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,200
Kakashi…
244
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,750
Hatake.
245
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,250
Cripes… So much fuss for nothing.
246
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,700
I…
247
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,950
I put it under my headband
248
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,950
in order not to drop the important ticket
during morning training.
249
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,620
Okay, that’s fine…
Eat well and do your best.
250
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,540
Hmm?
251
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,990
You’re going to do it again
after this, right? Training?
252
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,990
Of course! I’m full of motivation.
253
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,450
Good! Here you go.
254
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,620
Another serving for free! Go for it!
255
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,500
Thank you, sir!
256
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,990
Welcome.
257
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,040
Just like I heard…
I had to come and see it.
258
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,370
It seems that you really
are just eating ramen.
259
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,990
Oh, Pervy Sage!
260
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,910
A cycle of hardship, right?
261
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,870
Inside, we were crying, right?
262
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:41,120
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?
263
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,040
It's a secondary role,
264
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,990
a role in the shadows
265
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,250
But in reaching for that dream,
266
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,990
let us stay centered,
let us stay true
267
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,040
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up
268
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,000
Over and over,
we kept coming back up
269
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:20,290
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed
270
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,990
Over and over,
we've seen fools
271
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,080
Itachi Uchiha…
272
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,040
who became a leader of
Anbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen
273
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,830
and who destroyed
the Uchiha clan single-handedly.
274
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,040
I don’t know why he has
suddenly appeared after all this time…
275
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,120
But I don’t think we will
allow him to leave so easily.
276
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,040
What is your purpose?!
277
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,700
Next time: “Sharingan vs. Sharingan!”
//%
1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,930
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,840
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,140
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,300
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,470
I'll laugh with  you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,010
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,890
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:05,010
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:12,180
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,850
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,840
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,970
Okay! Drink! Sing!
13
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,600
Let's have fun!
14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,720
Good grief…This is too much for…
a pre-celebration.
15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
Did you take care of the business?
16
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,840
Yes…
17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,050
More importantly,
the rain’s starting to let up.
18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Shouldn’t you quickly put an end
to this farce of a race?
19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,840
Fine.
20
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,350
Guess I’ll go for a run!
21
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
A-Above here, huh?
22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,510
Yeah…
23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,100
It’s a quite a long staircase,
believe it.
24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,890
They’re also called
the Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart.
25
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,510
Heh, cool!
26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,220
Let’s go at a sprint!
27
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,840
Hey, he’s kidding, right?
28
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,890
What kind of stamina does he have?
29
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,050
Boss.
30
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,390
It seems Idate is heading this way!
31
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,510
He hasn’t run away,
just like you said, Boss.
32
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
Of course…
33
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,840
I saw potential in him.
34
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,840
Now, it’s just a little more!
Run Idate!
35
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,220
A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder
36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,180
Hey…you…!
37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,510
Huh?
38
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,510
Let me tell you…
39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,180
It’s not like I trust you
or anything yet, okay?
40
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,510
Yeah, yeah whatever.
41
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,180
It doesn’t really matter to me,
believe it.
42
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,260
There’s a person
who still trusts you, right?!
43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,260
During the Chunin Exam…
44
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,930
Huh?
45
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,840
You said that a tenth problem
appeared, right?
46
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,180
Yeah. It was a weird problem to determine
whether you’d take the problem or not.
47
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Three years ago…
48
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,100
I got a similar problem…
49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,350
Okay, now I’m going to
give the tenth problem.
50
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
The tenth problem…
51
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,840
What kind of problem is
Big Brother going to give?!
52
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,550
The tenth problem is a battle
53
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,390
with the Three-Man Squad
you were teamed up with.
54
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
The three of you will compete against
each other this exercise.
55
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,640
And among you…
one of you will be failed!
56
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,680
And the one who is failed
will remain a Genin for life
57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,890
and we will never again
let them take the Chunin Exam!
58
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,300
N-No way…
59
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,350
Then for what purpose
were we together until now?
60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,180
I make the rules here.
61
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,850
Back-talk is not allowed at all!
62
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,970
If you want to withdraw,
you should do so.
63
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,640
Withdrawing here and
waiting half a year is also a way.
64
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,720
If one person among
the three withdraws,
65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,970
of course all three members
will be disqualified.
66
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,260
But you will be allowed
to take the Chunin Exam
67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,390
one more time, in half a year.
68
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,640
So, what will you do?
69
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,600
One comrade will be dropped.
70
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,550
I have the confidence to pass.
71
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,510
But, one of them will remain
a Genin for life.
72
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,550
It’s a choice between
comrades and your life.
73
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,300
If you’re going to quit,
now’s the time.
74
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,260
Is there nobody else
who’s going to withdraw?
75
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,720
We’re good, then.
76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,180
Okay, to everyone who
has remained here…
77
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,840
I render you disqualified!
78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,390
Wh-Why…?
79
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,680
H-Hold on a minute!
80
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,180
I prepared myself and remained here!
81
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,840
Such preparedness is below contempt!
82
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Scums like you don’t have
the qualifications to become Chunin!
83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,180
That’s all!
84
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,010
I see…
85
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,260
What kind of a test was it
for you guys?
86
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,470
I forgot…
87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,260
I mean, it was explained to me,
but I didn’t really get it.
88
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Trusting in my big brother’s words,
I remained in the classroom.
89
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,600
And yet I was failed!
90
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,180
No way could I take that.
I questioned my big brother.
91
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Big Brother!
What’s up with that test?!
92
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
A Shinobi reads the double bluff.
93
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,100
You should’ve understood
that was the test.
94
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,140
Even so, I can’t accept that!
95
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,100
No matter how dangerous,
96
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,430
isn’t it necessary to have
the courage to plunge into any mission?!
97
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,840
Idate.
98
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,300
Can you really not accept it?
99
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,350
Of course not, such a…
100
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,010
You…quit as a Ninja.
101
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,140
If you’re telling me to quit,
then I will.
102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
But tell me why I’m no good!
103
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,840
That’s something you should
realize yourself,
104
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,550
with your own power.
105
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,550
To this day…I don’t understand
the answer to that.
106
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,220
So after that,
you were deceived by Aoi, huh?
107
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,840
Yeah, that’s right.
108
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,930
We made it…to the top!
109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,890
I’m going by myself from here.
You rest!
110
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,140
Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?!
111
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,470
I can’t be asking you guys
to help any more.
112
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,850
There’s no point if I don’t win by myself,
on my own strength!
113
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,840
Oh…hey! Idate!
114
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,180
I can make it! It seems
Sakura’s special medicine has worked!
115
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,470
Blast!
116
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,430
This doesn’t hurt!
117
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,800
I’m back in the game…
from here!
118
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,350
If we cross this suspension bridge,
it’s Ouzu Island, huh?
119
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,050
We should hurry.
120
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,930
It seems Idate has made it
to the Modoroki Shrine.
121
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,100
What?!
122
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,550
It seems we underestimated
the Leaf Genin a bit…
123
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,600
You jerk!
You didn’t finish them?!
124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,350
Now’s not the time to be talking
about stuff like that.
125
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,840
Please cross the bridge quickly!
126
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,800
Useless Ninja!
127
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,840
Hey! I’m only helping you
because it’s the job.
128
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,890
I’ll waste you if you keep
talking smart to me.
129
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,430
I-I’m sorry…
130
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,260
If you’ve understood,
then get a move on!
131
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,220
Y-Yes!
132
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,010
There he is! That Fukusuke jerk!
133
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,840
This is quite something.
134
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,390
I never thought
you’d make it this far.
135
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,850
That’s the…
Blade of the Thunder God!
136
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,840
Stop!
137
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,890
Stop!
138
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,840
Stop kicking a dead horse.
139
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,840
Nobody is a match for
the legendary Blade of the Thunder God,
140
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,100
said to have been used
by the Second Hokage.
141
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,350
You should know this well.
142
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,640
After all, you’re the man
who stole this for me.
143
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,760
Blast…
144
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,840
Mud balls, huh?
lt’s just like a kid’s fight.
145
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,180
Sorry, I didn’t have
any Kunai Knives.
146
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,260
Naruto…
147
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,840
But you won’t be able to dodge
the next ball just with that.
148
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,140
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
149
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,680
He’s concentrating
the Chakra in his palm.
150
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,640
Here I come!
151
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,840
Here I come!
152
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,850
Once more!
153
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,840
I don’t know what
you intend to do, but…
154
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,800
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
155
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,840
Too bad.
156
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,840
This Blade of the Thunder God
cuts through anything!
157
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,430
Even Chakra itself is no exception.
158
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Naruto!
159
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,350
I have to make doubly sure
160
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
so that nothing troublesome
will happen again.
161
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,050
I’m your opponent!
Keep your hands off Idate!
162
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,390
Humph, are you still
saying such things?
163
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,840
Saving each other, protecting each other,
trusting each other.
164
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,640
It ticks me off!
165
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,350
The weak can't survive
if they don’t support each other.
166
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,840
So they trust people easily
and are betrayed.
167
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,390
Weaklings like you guys
should just run about and away.
168
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,050
Right, Idate?
169
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,050
It was like that also
when you stole
170
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,680
this Blade of the Thunder God, right?
171
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,840
I can see it.
That’s the Village Hidden in the Rain.
172
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,930
Aoi Sensei?!
173
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,510
Aoi Sensei!
174
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,350
Idate…
175
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,180
B-Big Brother…
176
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,220
You idiot!
177
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,180
Go back to the village immediately
and surrender yourself!
178
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,470
You?!
179
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,890
Do you know what
you have done?
180
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,890
What?!
181
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,010
Strict as always, eh?
And he’s your cute little brother.
182
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,600
But it’s truly perfect that
you’ve shown up here.
183
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,800
Aoi Sensei…
184
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
This forbidden Jutsu scroll
can’t be deciphered
185
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,050
unless you’re Jonin class.
186
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,760
I’ll have the brothers
betray the Leaf Village together.
187
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,840
Ibiki, please decipher it already.
188
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,720
I refuse.
189
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,760
So are you choosing death,
together with Idate?
190
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,470
Such as he is,
he’s also a Shinobi.
191
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,470
He’s not afraid of death.
192
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
It doesn’t seem so.
193
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,140
This face is one taut with fear.
194
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,550
I’m quitting as a Ninja!
So please don’t kill me!
195
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,260
Please decipher it.
196
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,300
You don’t want to see
your cute little brother killed
197
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,100
before your eyes, do you?
198
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,680
Little brother, you say?
199
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,930
That fool?
200
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,800
Big Brother…
201
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,840
Such a threat means nothing to me.
202
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,800
Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hidden
in the Leaves that important?
203
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,850
Even if you protect it at
the risk of your own life,
204
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,390
you’re nothing but a pawn!
205
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,010
So that’s why
you became a traitor?
206
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,890
You’re a pathetic man!
207
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,510
You punk!
208
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,220
Idate!
209
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,640
You, run away!
210
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,260
What about you, Big Brother?
211
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,840
I’ll go, after I clean up
the mess here!
212
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,640
I don’t think so!
213
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,840
Big Brother!
214
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,510
Go, quickly!
215
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,720
But Big Brother…!
216
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,800
Go! Having you stay is a burden!
217
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,760
I won’t let you!
218
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,220
Go!
219
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,140
So appalling…
220
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,050
that he’d risk
his life for such an idiotic guy.
221
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,470
All you could do after that
was run.
222
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,180
You could’ve returned
to the village and called for help.
223
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,430
But you didn’t do that.
224
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,970
Thinking Ibiki was dead
was no excuse!
225
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,600
The fact is, he was alive…
226
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,930
In that regard,
lbiki was admirable.
227
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,640
Not only did he completely endure
repeated interrogation,
228
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,010
but he also retrieved
the Forbidden Jutsu scroll...
229
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,510
without having confessed to anything!
230
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,510
And to think that he did
all this
231
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,890
for his good-for-nothing little brother.
232
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,550
You betrayed your village,
abandoned your older brother,
233
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,010
and came to think of only yourself.
234
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,550
Even Ibiki who is blood-related
and risked his life to save you,
235
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,800
you didn’t trust him!
236
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,930
Afraid of being accused,
237
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,100
you didn’t trust the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, your birthplace…
238
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,390
You trust nobody.
239
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,510
You’re not trusted by anyone.
240
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,220
For me, there is no pupil
as excellent as you.
241
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,850
As a reward,
I’ll let you die in one instant.
242
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,600
Idate!
243
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,840
Sasuke…Sakura!
244
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,010
Rest, Naruto!
245
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I’ll beat this guy!
246
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
Don’t be acting cool, believe it.
247
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,720
You can’t beat me, no matter
how many people show up.
248
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,260
Me, Aoi Rokusho,
249
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,350
the Rain Jonin who possesses
the Blade of the Thunder God.
250
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,890
Is that so?
251
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,840
Interesting.
252
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,840
The Blade of the Thunder God
and my Chidori!
253
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,720
Let’s test which is better!
254
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,970
The rumors were true.
255
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,840
The survivor of the village’s honorable
Uchiha Clan…
256
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,140
is just a good-for-nothing kid…
257
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,260
Sasuke!
258
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,840
Run, Sakura!
259
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,850
He’ll show no mercy,
no matter who the person is.
260
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,720
Everyone will be killed!
261
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,180
No way!
262
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,390
Huh?!
263
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,390
We’ll protect you,
no matter what.
264
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,050
We promised that, didn’t we?!
265
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,050
Trust us!
266
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,390
Now all that’s left is
the wounded rabbit
267
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,720
and the excellent pupil, huh?
268
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
You two together,
go to the next world.
269
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,050
Take it back!
270
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Take it back!
271
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,470
What’re you talking about?
272
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,180
What you said…
273
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,640
earlier!
274
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,260
Don't mess…
275
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,800
with the Uchiha…
276	02:10:08:14	02:10:10:02
with me!
276
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,550
Why you--!
277
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,760
Sasuke!
278
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,350
Sasuke! Get up!
279
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,840
How very cold the bottom
of the ocean must be.
280
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,350
Stop!
281
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,840
Idate!
282
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,510
Sakura!
283
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,180
Sakura!
284
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:31,840
Once in a long while, once in a while
285
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:37,550
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
286
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,840
Look like a mountain
287
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:52,970
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
288
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,720
The remnants of a person crying
289
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,760
Look like a mountain
290
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,430
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
291
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,260
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
292
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,600
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
293
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,840
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
294
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,930
Look like a mountain
295
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,180
Look like a mountain
296
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,840
Look like a mountain
297
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,970
Look like a mountain
298
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,840
What the heck should we do?
299
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
That sword of the Second Hokage
won't budge an inch
300
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,050
even with Sasuke's Chidori
or my Rasengan!
301
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,720
But I can't lose this battle.
302
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,680
I won't run away, no matter what!
303
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,140
If my techniques aren't going to work,
I'll just have to keep trying!
304
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,350
Next time: "The Last Leg:
A Final Act of Desperation"
//%
1
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,980
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,190
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,350
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:53,060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,940
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:05,060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,690
Sasuke!
13
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,890
It will be necessary for you
to die once…
14
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,940
Die once, you said?
15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,730
Mind Awakening Pill.
16
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,810
You will take these.
17
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,690
Mind Awakening Pill…?
What is that?
18
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,810
Your Curse Mark level is
at the first state…
19
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,890
These pills will forcibly stimulate
20
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,890
the power of the Curse Marks
to the second state.
21
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,890
However, if you move up
to the second state,
22
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,060
the Curse Mark’s erosion
will accelerate drastically
23
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,190
and if things are left that way
you will die immediately!
24
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,810
However…
25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,850
In order to control
the power of the second state,
26
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,980
it is necessary to allow one’s body
to get accustomed to it
27
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,890
over the course of several hours.
28
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,890
In doing so, you will…
29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,890
attain power that is
equal to ours, however…
30
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,560
Once awake, you can’t possibly
last more than a few minutes…
31
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,690
and will certainly die!
32
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,480
Sound vs. Leaf
33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,480
Die…and what will happen after that?
34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,940
You don’t need to worry.
35
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,690
That’s why we’re here.
36
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,020
We will use Barrier Ninjutsu
to suppress the side effects.
37
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,440
We will mitigate that phase
38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,520
to ease you from eternal death
to a state of half death.
39
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,900
You really think I can put my faith
in your Barrier Ninjutsu or whatever?
40
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,310
Master Sasuke…
41
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,270
We normally function
as Lord Orochimaru’s bodyguards!
42
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,350
We know our stuff when it comes
to Barrier or Defense Ninjutsu,
43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,890
Curse Marks and Sealing Jutsu!
44
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,440
I absolutely cannot die yet!
45
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
I’m counting on you.
46
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,850
Hey!
47
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,310
We’re gonna lose him
if you guys are slow!
48
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,150
Get into position!
49
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,890
Begin!
50
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,980
– Four Black Mists Formation!
– Four Black Mists Formation!
51
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,900
Black Seal!
52
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,150
All right. We're done for now.
53
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,850
Man, I’m exhausted.
54
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,890
I didn’t think this mission
would drag on this long.
55
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,940
I’ll go check out the situation.
Let’s go, Raido!
56
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,400
Right.
57
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,650
Darn. This has sure gotten troublesome.
58
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,400
There’s one…
59
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,020
No, two of them.
60
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,940
Here they come!
61
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,770
You guys are Orochimaru’s…
62
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,190
Judging from the direction
you came from,
63
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,770
it appears that you are on your way back
from the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
64
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,890
What’s in that barrel?
65
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,890
Having two Jonin as opponents…
66
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,730
That’s a tough one.
67
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,520
Every one of them
got the Curse Marks…
68
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,020
You refuse to answer?
69
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,770
This will be different from that time before
with your surprise attack.
70
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,690
Shut up, you scum!
71
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,020
Just drop dead!
72
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,890
Orochimaru’s toys…
73
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,310
Don’t you dare monkey around
with Leaf Shinobi!
74
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,940
Those two are really late, aren’t they?
75
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
What should we do, Shizune?
76
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,900
Let’s go see!
77
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,730
Right!
78
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,150
Shikamaru!
79
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,270
What’s the matter?
80
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,480
There’s a smell of blood nearby.
81
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,890
Wh-What’s this?!
82
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,900
Raido! Genma!
83
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,890
This isn’t good!
84
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,520
I can’t believe these two
could have been taken down…!
85
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,810
The best I can do right now is
give him some stop-gap treatment…
86
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,230
Shizune…
87
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,190
I’m gonna hunt those guys down!
88
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,560
No!
89
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,270
B-But…
90
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,890
W-Wait…lwashi.
91
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,850
Th-The Jutsu that those guys have
is no longer that of mere Shinobi…
92
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,890
If you pursue them alone,
you'll only die.
93
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,890
Genma…don’t talk anymore!
94
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,890
The smell of the other two impinged
on the five others including Sasuke…
95
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,690
But the five are moving away
from the smell of the blood!
96
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,730
What should we do?!
97
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,980
Just as I thought.
He has guides.
98
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,060
This has really turned into
a real pain in the neck.
99
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,230
Let’s hurry up and pursue Sasuke!
100
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,020
Shut up, Naruto!
101
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,890
That’s for Shikamaru to decide!
Don’t play the boss!
102
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,940
Shikamaru?
103
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,150
The fact that there was
the smell of blood probably means
104
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,440
that a battle occurred somewhere.
105
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,810
If we go to that location we should
be able to gather some information…
106
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,770
We must be attentive
as we near the location,
107
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,520
so we would have to switch over to
108
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,900
a reconnaissance pattern
and approach walking slowly…
109
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,890
While all that’s going on
110
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,900
Sasuke will cross over
the Land of Fire border!
111
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,890
What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?!
112
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,190
All right! Let’s pursue Sasuke!
113
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,100
All right! That’s what I was waiting for!
114
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,850
However…
115
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,890
The fact that there was a battle
means they’ll have their guard up.
116
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,480
They’ll certainly be aware
117
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,730
of the fact that there might
be Ninja on their tail.
118
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,890
In other words,
119
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,690
the odds are high that
there will be traps or an ambush.
120
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,230
Listen carefully…
121
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,890
Hereafter, I want you to use your visual
and acoustic senses to the fullest!
122
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,850
We need to locate those guys before
we get caught in an ambush!
123
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,690
And if we come across
anything suspicious,
124
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,770
don't just dodge them,
interpret them!
125
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,770
All right!
126
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,940
When we find them,
127
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,890
I’m gonna use my new Jutsu
to clobber them!
128
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,850
That Naruto…
129
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,900
Each time I see him
he’s added a new Jutsu to his arsenal.
130
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,730
Darn! Just when I thought
I had caught up with him…
131
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,060
Hey! The enemy’s smell is everywhere!
132
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,730
Everybody! Stop!
133
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,480
Take a careful look above you.
134
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,650
Paper Bombs…
135
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,980
And in five other places too!
136
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,520
The figuration is that of
a Perimeter Barrier.
137
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,890
Perimeter Barrier…?
138
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,650
It’s one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu!
139
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,100
Perimeter-type traps have a time lag
and are activated
140
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,520
when one enters the area that
has been marked by the enemy.
141
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,690
It’s advanced Jutsu…
142
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,020
It was in one of the books that
my father made me read.
143
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,980
Darn! Our only choice
is to make a detour…
144
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,520
Lee… Do what you have to do!
145
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,730
Lee!
146
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,190
It’s too soon to be doing that!
147
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,400
Lady Fifth Hokage!
148
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,480
I already know that
you’re a foolhardy guy.
149
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,940
But you’ve just had an operation.
150
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,890
You don’t need to be rushing
into things.
151
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,190
I want to hurry up and
do even a little training.
152
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,020
I also want to… I want to…
153
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,150
Building your strength isn’t
the only form of training.
154
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,230
Don’t you agree?
155
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,350
It is said that Ninja are those
156
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,310
who can forebear and
endure any hardship.
157
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,890
I understand how you feel but…
158
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,890
That means that this too
is one kind of training.
159
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,650
Training…
160
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,890
What if you were to do something foolhardy
and you got worse?
161
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,350
Wh-What’s that?
162
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,100
It’s medicine that I prepared.
163
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,850
First, drink this and get better!
164
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,810
Right!
165
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,440
Come, let’s go…
166
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,440
Yes, ma’am.
167
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,890
Damn! Nothing but traps!
168
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,890
Yeah, but the enemy seems
pressed for time.
169
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,560
The traps have noticeable flaws.
170
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,890
Hey, hey, Naruto!
There’s wire at your feet!
171
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,520
Don’t trip on it!
172
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,560
I know that already!
173
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,020
Wait, Naruto!
174
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,270
Shadow Possession Jutsu…
175
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,100
M-Made it just in the nick of time.
176
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,890
Naruto! I told you to be careful!
177
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,480
I see… One of the wires is
readily visible because it reflects light.
178
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,850
The other wire has been coated
with a matte green.
179
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,900
So it’s very difficult to see
with the naked eye.
180
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,310
It’s a double trap, huh.
181
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,440
Despite the fact that
they’re in a hurry,
182
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,560
that’s certainly an elaborate trap.
183
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,230
Which means that…
184
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,520
That they’re at rest.
185
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,940
Perhaps they got injured,
or that itself could be a trap…
186
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,890
Byakugan!
187
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,230
Caught ‘em!
188
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,020
All right! All right!
I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!
189
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,810
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
190
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,600
but I’m gonna demonstrate
my new Jutsu right here!
191
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,690
Me too!
192
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,890
Don’t be so hasty.
193
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,890
As soon as preparations have been made
to implement my strategy…
194
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,850
we’ll make direct contact
with the target!
195
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,560
Darn! When we’re in a hurry,
having to take a darn break…
196
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,150
It can’t be helped.
197
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,270
When one fights at the second state,
one’s body gets drained drastically.
198
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
More than that,
199
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,980
it’s an ordeal not to be able
to use one’s body for a while…
200
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,890
It can’t be helped with
two Jonin-class guys as the opponents.
201
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,980
If we act in moderation,
we’ll be done in.
202
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,270
Kiba…
203
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,890
In that event,
204
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,690
don’t mess up the timing
of the Smoke Bombs.
205
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,770
Got it!
206
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,690
Now then…
207
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,310
we'll split up into two teams.
208
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,560
– Right! 					– Okay!
209
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,310
It looks like they haven’t noticed us yet.
210
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,810
Hey, Sasuke's not around.
211
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,890
It appears that…
212
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,890
He’s inside that “coffin.”
213
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,890
Is he dead?!
214
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,600
That barrel is secured with Barriers.
I can't see through it.
215
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,190
I wouldn’t think that the guys
who wanted Sasuke
216
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,150
would kill him that easily.
217
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,730
You might be right about that.
218
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:32,890
Once in a long while, once in a while
219
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:38,480
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
220
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,770
Look like a mountain
221
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,900
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
222
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,650
The remnants of a person crying
223
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,690
Look like a mountain
224
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,350
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
225
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,190
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
226
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,520
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
227
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,770
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
228
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,890
Look like a mountain
229
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,100
Look like a mountain
230
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,850
Look like a mountain
231
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,940
Look like a mountain
232
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,270
Gimme a break, Shikamaru!
You're not reliable in the least!
233
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,480
And you still call yourself
a leader?!
234
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,350
But this situation sure
is a problem.
235
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,270
Leave this kind of thing to me.
lt'll be a cinch.
236
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,310
– I sure hope it will be.
– What do you mean by that?!
237
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,350
It's too much of a hassle to explain.
238
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,690
– Shut up, Akamaru!
– Shut up, Akamaru!
239
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,850
What was that?!
Give 'em some more, Akamaru!
240
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,890
Well, if things come to this,
I'll use that special weapon, Rasengan!
241
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,890
Next time: "Squad Mutiny:
Everything Falls Apart!"
//%
1
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,550
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,680
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,100
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,760
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,260
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,890
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,350
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,180
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,930
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,470
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,010
It's unforgivable!
21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,590
Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja…
22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,590
Their feelings towards the clan
are the same as our feelings!
23
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,350
Manipulating the Fuma’s feelings of
wanting to restore their clan…
24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,720
I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt,
no matter what!
25
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,220
Pure Terror
The House of Orochimaru
26
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,260
How did the Pervy Sage,
27
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,720
who was once so easily defeated by
Old Lady Tsunade’s numbing medicine
28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,970
detect Sasame’s medicine this time?
29
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,800
Isn’t it strange that
Master Jiraiya’s that sharp?
30
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,550
Hey, hey…
31
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,140
Remember when Sasame talked
about Hanzaki and said he’s a traitor?
32
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,890
That’s how I knew…
33
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,350
Hanzaki told me everything…
34
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,600
When Orochimaru came to this land,
there were those among us
35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,640
who wanted to use his strength
to revive the clan
36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,180
and those that saw his evil intent
and said we should not join him.
37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,640
Hmm… so that’s why you guys
were chased out of your village.
38
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,970
Yes. It was probably Orochimaru’s idea
we were chased out of our village
39
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,390
as traitors who were getting
in the way of a revival of the clan.
40
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,390
When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,
41
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,890
I knew that Sasame had ties to a group
that was on Orochimaru’s side.
42
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,590
Fool!
43
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,800
Hey, Pervy Sage!
44
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,720
Just wait a minute!
45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,590
I’m prepared!
46
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,850
Sasame, you did it so that
you could meet Arashi… Isn't that so?
47
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,600
I’m sorry…
that was the only thing I could do.
48
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,590
Master Jiraiya!
49
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,390
Sasame did it only because
she wanted to see her cousin.
50
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,510
Please forgive her!
51
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,800
I’m asking you to forgive her too!
52
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,720
The law of the Shinobi
is a strict thing…
53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,260
I can’t just acquit her like this.
54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,260
Then punish me first!
55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,510
I promised I’d help Sasame
see her cousin Arashi!
56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,760
If I don’t fulfill that I’ll have twisted
my Way of Ninja!
57
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,260
Master Jiraiya, me too!
58
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,640
Now now, wait a minute!
lt’s not as if I’m gonna eat her alive.
59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,590
– Huh?! 					– Oh?
60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,550
Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that
61
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,260
you might leave your village to
look for Arashi…
62
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,010
After you escort us to
Orochimaru’s hideout,
63
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,590
you’ll immediately head to
the inn where Hanzaki is
64
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,180
and wait there for our return.
65
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,590
That is the punishment given to you.
66
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,680
Master Jiraiya…
67
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,180
Pervy Sage,
I’ve gotta give you more credit!
68
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,930
Thank you, Master Jiraiya!
69
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,600
Well, Hanzaki treated me to
a lot of special service at the Fuma Bar
70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,590
and asked me to look after Sasame…
71
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,300
I thought it was something
like that anyway!
72
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,590
I feel cheated that
I gave you more credit!
73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,050
He, hey…
lt’s all right once in a while, right?
74
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,760
There’s something called
socializing for adults…
75
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,970
There it is….
76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,760
Leave the rest to us.
77
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,100
Sasame, be careful going back
to the inn.
78
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,180
Don’t worry! I will absolutely
bring Arashi back!
79
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,550
Please take care of Arashi!
80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,390
Leave it to me!
81
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,590
Just wait, and rest assured that
I’ll do everything I can!
82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,350
Stop getting so carried away Naruto,
you idiot!
83
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,590
Oww!
84
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,100
That’s where…
85
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,220
Sasuke is…!
86
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,590
So this is the only entrance…
87
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,590
If they’re lying in wait,
we’ll be picked off.
88
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,600
But there’s nothing we can do but go!
89
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,590
Well, don’t panic.
90
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,390
If three large rats go, we’ll stand out.
91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,590
First, let’s send out one
that won’t stand out.
92
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,350
Summoning Jutsu!
93
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,050
Hey!
94
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,590
Th-The frog spoke!
95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,930
Hey, it’s been a while!
Sakura, this is Gamakichi.
96
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,590
Gamakichi?!
97
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,800
I wanted to ask you to do
some reconnaissance.
98
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,590
All right! That’s a simple task.
Leave it to me!
99
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,590
I can’t help it,
frogs give me the creeps …
100
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,640
There doesn’t seem
to be anything fishy…
101
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,590
There doesn’t seem to be
a trap at the entrance.
102
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,050
Arashi…
103
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,050
There’s nothing to it around here.
104
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,220
Hmm…
105
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,970
What shall we do?
106
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,220
It seems there’s no choice
but to split up into three.
107
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,590
My instinct tells me
it’s the middle one!
108
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,470
Wait!
109
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,010
What the heck?!
110
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,600
At times like this, it’s especially
important to move carefully…
111
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,430
All right, I’ll go this way!
112
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,720
That’s it?!
113
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,050
So what’s so different from
my instinct and that, Pervy Sage?
114
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,760
Well, it’s a question of feeling…
115
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,430
If you haven’t found anything
after 30 minutes, come back.
116
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,430
Got it?
117
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah…
118
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,140
Naruto, Sakura, the two of you
should proceed together.
119
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,970
Listen, from this point forward,
it’s the first avenue of hell.
120
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,590
A demon might appear,
or a snake might appear.
121
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,590
Take them on mindfully!
122
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,890
Yup!
123
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,970
I understand!
124
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,590
We’re going down the middle!
125
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,590
Then I’m going this way…
126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,640
See ya …
127
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,220
Hmm…the smell of face powder.
128
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,600
I’m being invited in…
129
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,550
In that case, it might be good fun
to accept the invitation.
130
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,100
What…?
131
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,590
Because guests would be
arriving from far away,
132
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,590
I was directed by Lord Orochimaru
to entertain.
133
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,430
I’m guessing
it's a type of fox raccoon ghost…
134
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,220
If you’re saying
I’m some raccoon or fox,
135
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,890
you ought to come over here
and check to see if I have a tail or not.
136
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,590
Oh, this path was right on…
137
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,590
How about yours, Naruto?
138
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,890
Sakura, be careful!
139
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,970
There’s no telling what sort
of traps there might be…
140
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,010
Yeah…
141
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,600
– Oh?! 					– Naruto?!
142
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,600
And you were the one who
said to be careful!
143
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,180
It was an ingenious trap floor!
144
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,640
Oh!
145
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,010
What the hell is next!
146
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,590
Sakura!
147
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,680
Naruto!
148
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,180
It’s my fault…
149
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Naruto!
150
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,640
What the hell…
151
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,970
I can’t get out…
152
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,550
What’re you doing?!
153
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,640
You screamed in such
a misleading way, I totally thought…
154
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,050
Give me a hand!
155
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,590
You’re really a handful!
156
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,050
Ya saved me…
157
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,590
Really! I’ll go first!
158
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,350
Naruto…
159
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,220
It’s all right now.
160
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,010
Here!
161
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,390
Huh?!
162
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,680
Naruto!
163
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,760
Naruto!
164
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,100
Naruto!
165
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,180
Sakura…
166
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,590
Naruto?! Are you all right?
167
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,220
Don’t worry about me.
168
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,510
You need to hurry and
get out of this trap hallway!
169
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,590
But…
170
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I said go! I’ll follow behind for sure!
171
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,100
Really?
172
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,390
Yeah… I’ll catch up in no time!
173
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,470
You’d better come, no matter what.
174
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,590
It’s a promise, you know…
175
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,300
The sake doesn’t seem
tampered with.
176
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,220
So what kind of plot has been prepared…?
177
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,590
Just as I’d expect from
the Village Hidden in Sound…
178
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,100
Are you planning to put a Jutsu
on me using music?
179
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,260
The music isn’t only for guests.
lt’s for myself…
180
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,590
I see…
181
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,220
What do you play for your heart?
182
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,180
Music for my own funeral…
183
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,590
Trying to seduce me….
You’ve underestimated this Jiraiya!
184
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,930
Escorting the guest to
the underworld is my last mission.
185
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
A suspended ceiling?!
186
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,590
I need to hurry up
and get out of this place!
187
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,100
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
188
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,930
This is torture!
189
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,470
What the hell?!
190
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,220
Give me a hand!
191
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,430
We need to build up our Chakra
and create the Rasengan!
192
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,180
Don’t be absurd!
193
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,970
We can’t stretch
our bodies beyond this!
194
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,890
My muscles are cramping up!
195
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,590
Man! I’ve gotta do something…
196
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,470
– What! 					– Huh?!
197
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
What?!
198
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,890
– Water?! 					– Water!
199
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,930
Looks like I’ve been saved.
200
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,590
Hey, get outta my way!
201
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,220
Oh, it’s you, Naruto.
202
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,590
Gamakichi, is there
a way out somewhere?
203
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,680
Don’t know!
I was flushed down here too.
204
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,180
So it’s no good…
205
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,590
Hey, are you all right?
206
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,590
How could I be all right!
207
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,590
Naruto’s taking a long time.
208
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,050
Maybe I should go back…
209
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,930
It's admirable that
you made it this far, Sakura.
210
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,590
Is that Kabuto’s voice?!
211
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,470
Isn’t it ironic?
212
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,390
During the Chunin Exam
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves,
213
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,100
you were the only one
that dragged the team down,
214
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,590
but yet you’re the one
to make it this far.
215
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,220
I’m not by myself!
216
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,350
Naruto and Master Jiraiya
will be here right away!
217
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,510
Where’s Sasuke?
He is all right, isn’t he?
218
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,470
Shouldn’t you be worried about
Naruto and Master Jiraiya,
219
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,890
and not Sasuke?
220
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,140
Well, it may very well be that those two
are no longer in this world anymore.
221
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,760
No way…
222
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,140
There’s no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto
would be taken down that easily!
223
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,220
I wonder if that’s so?
224
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,590
Maybe you dragged Naruto
down like you always do?
225
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,850
So I’m right …
226
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,550
Naruto…
227
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,260
If you’re worried
you should go and see…
228
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,010
Or perhaps you’re afraid
of me attacking
229
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,470
and you can’t come out
from behind the pillar.
230
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,350
If someone like you were
on my team,
231
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,180
I don’t know how many lives
I would need.
232
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,590
I can too…
233
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,930
I can too!
234
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,260
Substitution Jutsu?!
235
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,050
Substitution again?!
236
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,720
I can too…
When I fight, I fight!
237
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,590
As I thought, this is all you’ve got…
238
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,970
It’s about time I put an end to this.
239
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,100
I can’t keep Lord Orochimaru waiting
for no reason any longer, you see.
240
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,220
Orochimaru?!
241
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,590
Now…shall we see…
242
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,390
just who will be stealing
scrolls from whom?
243
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,640
We’ll fight to the death!
244
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,970
No! I’m different from how I was…then!
245
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,050
I wonder if that’s true…
246
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,350
It can’t be…
247
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,930
Even if you put up a bluff,
I can foresee …
248
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,800
You are already…finished.
249
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,470
When I recalled the parts one by one,
250
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,680
I felt as though
I had understood everything
251
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:45,390
Faded words which I kept so close to me
252
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:55,100
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
253
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,850
and this distant yearning for you
254
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:11,220
I live, simply repeating this cycle
255
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:22,850
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
256
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:33,390
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
257
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,050
I’ll keep these thoughts…
258
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,220
I’m scared.
What is this intimidating feeling?
259
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,470
My legs are weak and
I don’t have any strength in my body.
260
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,010
I thought I’m not the same person
as I was in the past.
261
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,510
I must stop. Calm down.
262
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,350
These guys are here,
which means Sasuke is definitely here!
263
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,430
I need to fight!
I came here to save Sasuke!
264
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,590
Next time, “Two Heartbeats:
Kabuto's Trap”
//%
1
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,990
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,870
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,410
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,990
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,660
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:46,540
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:55,990
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:06,790
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:16,120
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,290
What were you gazing at?
11
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,160
Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name
12
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,370
Shizune!
13
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,990
Is anything wrong?!
14
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,330
What is it…?
15
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,450
It’s a protection commission
from the Village Hidden in the Stars.
16
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,700
Is there some kind
of problem with that?
17
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,990
You’ve never heard about it, Shizune?
18
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,830
The Village Hidden in the Stars
is small in terms of scale,
19
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,250
but they are very proud and
have often caused trouble…
20
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,910
So, will you accept?
21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can’t simply disregard it.
22
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,040
What…?
23
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,000
Since you-know-what
is in that village.
24
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,160
And it seems they’ll form
a three-man team
25
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,990
with Neji as the squad leader.
26
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,870
But the Village Hidden in the Stars
is a Shinobi village, isn’t it?
27
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,990
Then they should do
their own protecting
28
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,830
without asking others.
29
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,410
There are often instances
of a small village
30
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,120
with friendly relations
seeking cooperation.
31
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,990
In particular, that village is small
32
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,700
and it seems there aren’t
that many Shinobi.
33
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,200
No kidding. But why’s a place
like that being targeted?
34
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
Actually…!
35
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,500
It all happened 200 years ago.
36
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,990
A star fell in the village!
37
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,580
Those stars like in the sky,
not ninja stars or something?!
38
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,120
Right! It seems
there’s a mysterious power in the star
39
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,870
that has an effect on Chakra!
40
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,410
That’s a superstition!
41
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,120
In the first place, no way has
a star ever come falling down!
42
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,990
It’s true!
43
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,620
It’s actually been targeted
several times until now
44
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,290
by Shinobi of other lands.
45
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,990
By Shinobi of other lands?
46
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,450
Mysterious power, huh?
47
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,040
Indeed, it does seem that someone
like Orochimaru would target it…
48
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,200
All right, I guess I’ll be participating
in this one too!
49
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,660
What?! But the three-man team’s
already been determined.
50
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,790
I’ve got an ace up my sleeve…
51
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,080
Amaguriama Sweet Shop
52
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,990
Listen up. I’ll take the lead from here.
53
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,290
There’s danger before
entering the village.
54
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,660
Okay, got it!
55
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,370
Hi, guys!
56
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,250
I’ll go on ahead and be waiting!
57
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,750
Naruto! Hold it!
58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,250
That idiot!
59
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,250
Umm, what’s Naruto doing
in a place like this?
60
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,410
Like I know.
61
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,990
Lady Tsunade, there was a report
62
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,990
that Naruto has joined up
with Neji’s squad.
63
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,990
Yes. I added him to
the Village Hidden in the Stars mission.
64
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,990
Why…?!
65
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,120
Those four proved themselves
in the Katabami Gold Mine…
66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,750
and things will quiet down
in the village here, too.
67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,410
You’d change an already determined
three-man squad just for that reason?!
68
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,870
Lady Tsunade?!
69
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,540
Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly
with gold leaf candy from Amaguriama?
70
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,540
Could it be that was from Naruto…?
70.01	01:06:50:29	01:06:52:26	Tea! Hurry!
71
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,950
Mizura!
72
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,700
You okay?!
73
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,120
I’m fine…
74
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,040
I told you not to push yourself!
75
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,290
But, I don’t want to fall behind
everyone’s training…
76
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,540
What’re you doing
during your training?!
77
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,990
Mizura suddenly keeled
over in pain…
78
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,700
Take him to the medical treatment room.
79
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,500
Yes sir.
80
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,830
I’ll go, too.
81
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,370
Hokuto by herself is
enough for an escort.
82
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,500
Sumaru, you have a mission.
83
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,540
All right! I’m here first!
84
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,450
Once I cross this valley,
I’ll be in the Land of Bears.
85
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,500
The Village Hidden in the Stars
is close.
86
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,750
Wha--?!
87
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,540
You little…!
88
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,830
Ninja Art: Kujaku…
89
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,990
Protection!
90
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,330
This guy blocked Kunai knives
with Chakra!
91
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
92
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,660
Cut!
93
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,700
Damn it!
94
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,750
Incredible Chakra!
95
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,990
Wait!
96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,990
This guy’s an enemy…
He suddenly attacked!
97
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,990
You’re Leaf Shinobi, right?
98
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,750
Are you from
the Village Hidden in the Stars?
99
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,450
I’m Sumaru.
I came to pick you guys up.
100
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,620
Then why did you do such a thing…?
101
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,290
Look at that.
102
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:21,990
Huh?
103
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,540
The border of the Land of Bears
is constantly filled with poison gas.
104
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,700
It’s also serves as
a natural fortress
105
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,580
against invasion from other lands.
106
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,870
So this is the danger
you were talking about, huh?
107
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,410
Isn’t that great, Naruto?
You owe Sumaru your life!
108
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,870
It’s the beginning of
a beautiful friendship
109
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,500
between the Leaf
and the Hidden Star Village.
110
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,080
Give me a break.
111
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,500
Was it none of my concern?
112
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,330
I could have just watched
and not done anything…
113
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,120
I am Akahoshi
114
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,750
and I serve as the deputy Hoshikage
of the Village Hidden in the Stars.
115
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,660
Deputy…Hoshikage?
116
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,410
Due to the sudden passing
of the Third Hoshikage one year ago,
117
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,040
presently there is
no Hoshikage in this village…
118
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,080
But, I heard the only ones who can
refer to themselves as a Kage
119
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,990
are the leaders of
the Five Great Hidden Villages…
120
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,950
That doesn’t make any difference!
121
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,410
We are not inferior to you guys!
122
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,990
Even if we’re small now,
this village will someday rival
123
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,080
the Hidden Villages of
the Five Great Nations!
124
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,910
At that time,
I’ll become the true Hoshikage!
125
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,870
Silence!
126
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,990
Go back to the training ground.
127
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,450
H-Hey, wait up!
128
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,750
Oh! Naruto!
129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
Naruto!
130
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
Now of all times!
131
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,250
Don’t worry about him.
Please continue your story.
132
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,700
Forgive me.
133
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,250
As  you say, the Shinobi in our village
are not qualified
134
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,160
to refer to themselves as a Kage.
135
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,290
However, in this village,
there is the star
136
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,330
that all the Kage in the Five
Great Hidden Villages also envy.
137
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,870
We will use the power
of the star and someday,
138
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,870
this can become a village which can
claim the Sixth Kage title.
139
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,120
So that star is being targeted, right?
140
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,870
Yes. Our search team
obtained some information.
141
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,910
Where’d that guy go?
142
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Hey!
143
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,290
I finally caught up.
Was your name Omaru?
144
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Not Omaru, Sumaru.
145
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh, sorry, sorry.
146
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,450
But Sumaru’s sure
an interesting name.
147
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,080
It’s another name for
the star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star.
148
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,410
Everyone in this village has
a name associated with stars.
149
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,620
After all, this is a village
where a star fell.
150
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,250
I see…
151
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,120
What’re you trying to elicit from me?
152
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,990
What? Nothing in particular.
153
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,200
I hadn’t thanked you for earlier, so.
154
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,410
I can tell even if you give me
the runaround…
155
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,080
The people from other lands
are all after the star.
156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,660
If you have that power,
157
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,990
you can stand above all
of the Hidden Villages, so…
158
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,790
Is your awesome Chakra
also the power of the star?
159
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,990
If they had that star,
160
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,000
would everyone have
the same Chakra as you?
161
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,200
No! The more tremendous the power,
162
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,990
the more hard work is required
to control it!
163
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,990
I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard!
164
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,370
I’ll become the Hoshikage!
165
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah! I look forward to working
with you at that time!
166
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,000
Huh…?
167
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,990
I’m also going to become
the Hokage someday, believe it!
168
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,830
You’re a strange guy.
169
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,990
Really?
170
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,990
Intruder!
171
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,990
Protect the star!
172
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,990
But they really are collapsed entirely
from the center towards the outside.
173
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,910
When a star explodes in mid-air,
it seems they collapse like this.
174
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,580
That’s the training area
where the star is enshrined.
175
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,540
Hurry up and show me the star.
176
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,370
No. People from other lands
aren't allowed beyond this spot.
177
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,000
But the star is over there, right?
178
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,580
I can’t protect it
if I can’t get close to it!
179
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,540
It’s not like we trust you guys.
180
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,040
Geez, you’re such a suspicious guy!
181
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,660
Why can’t you trust us
who came here on a mission?!
182
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,120
This is my personality, you see.
183
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,910
It can’t be?! No way.
184
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,910
I’ll chase him down!
185
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,290
You go to your friends
in the training area.
186
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,250
Hurry!
187
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,500
Right. Okay.
188
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,660
Hokuto!
189
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,830
Sumaru… I’m sorry.
190
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,410
We couldn’t protect the star…
191
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,830
You little!
192
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,500
It’s ridiculous to do something
like steal in someone else’s village
193
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,910
in broad daylight, you little thief!
194
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,500
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
195
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,620
Now, I won’t let you getaway!
196
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,370
Ninja Art: Kujaku…
197
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,580
This Chakra?!
198
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,580
Beast!
199
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,990
Uh, oh! Move away!
200
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,990
Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsu
towards that monster!
201
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,200
It’s futile!
202
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,040
This is my real target!
203
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,990
I found your weak point.
204
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,750
The main body doesn’t move
while controlling the Chakra!
205
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,950
Let’s go! Clone Body Slam!
206
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,450
There are more ways to
use my Chakra!
207
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,410
That one hit hard.
208
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,830
Synthesis!
209
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,290
Damn…
210
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Naruto!
211
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,790
Wings!
212
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,450
You can fly?!
213
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,620
You let him get away.
214
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,620
I’m sorry. But…
215
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,660
It was my mistake for
leaving it to you.
216
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,870
But as for him,
he used the same Ninja Art as you.
217
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,990
What’s the meaning of this?!
218
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,040
Only those who perform
the star training
219
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,000
can use that Ninja Art…
220
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,200
Then you’re saying
he’s someone from this village?
221
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,120
I don’t know…
222
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,330
I’m the one who let him get away.
223
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,750
I’ll get the star back, no matter what!
224
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,500
The wind blows, Ah…
225
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,250
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
226
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,990
What should be brought along?
227
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,990
Assemble them into a piece.
228
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,990
There is no second chance, never
229
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,540
How foolish it is to throw away
230
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,870
Acting so innocently, Ah…
231
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,700
The images.
232
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,790
It probably will not end
233
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,040
It probably will not end
234
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,990
Burn that love-filled heart,
235
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,990
Sail across a thousand dreams
236
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,990
Running freely
237
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,700
To take hold of the world in hand
238
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,830
The clouds scatter
239
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,790
The sun sets yet again
240
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:36,290
The solo parade begins to move.
241
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,620
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
242
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,040
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
243
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,990
I’m kind of bothered by
the village leader’s attitude.
244
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,660
That the opponent used
the Ninja Art: Kujaku means…
245
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,950
Yeah, the attacker is definitely
a Shinobi from this village.
246
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,040
But, that old man didn’t say anything.
247
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,990
It looks like there’s some kind
of secret.
248
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,450
We need to investigate him.
Let’s all split up.
249
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,410
Roger!
250
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,080
I’ll get that star back,
no matter what.
251
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,500
Next: “The Remembered Lullaby”
//%
1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,550
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,350
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,470
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,760
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,300
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,930
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,550
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,970
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,590
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,590
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,180
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,590
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,640
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,890
Viva Dojo Challenge!
Youth is all about Passion!
16
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,760
It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Naruto?
Were you alone on a mission this time?
17
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,600
I just went to deliver
Grandma Tsunade’s letter…
18
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,640
Is that so? Then you should
report to Lady Tsunade right away.
19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,300
I know!
20
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,300
I’ve only been away for a week,
21
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,590
but it seems as though
an awful lot has changed.
22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,470
DOJO CHALLENGERS,
COME THIS WAY
That sign wasn’t here before, either.
23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,430
Dojo challenge?
24
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,970
MAKE-OUT VIOLENCE 3
25
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,890
This way?
26
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,300
This is a tight squeeze.
27
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Is that it?
28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,300
PASSION DOJO
“Passion Dojo."
Who on earth built this?
29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
I’ve been waiting for you!
30
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,890
Huh?
31
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,590
You’ve come here
for a Dojo challenge, right?
32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Well, then.
Come at me from anywhere you like!
33
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,260
Huh? Bushy Brow?
34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,430
If you don’t make a move,
I’m coming at you!
35
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,970
What? Wait, hold it.
36
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,510
Hey, it’s me!
lt’s only me, Bushy Brow!
37
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,050
Naruto!
38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,180
Hey, that was close, I tell you!
39
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,350
So the first Dojo challenger
will be you, Naruto!
40
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,140
Well, I couldn’t wish for
a better opponent!
41
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,590
Huh?
42
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,140
I’m going to go at this for real!
43
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,260
W-Wait just a minute!
44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,050
Leaf Hurricane!
45
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,590
Here…
46
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,680
So you just came to view the grounds?
47
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,390
Then you should have said so
in the first place.
48
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,390
I never even got a chance to tell you.
You just suddenly attacked me.
49
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,050
I’m really sorry about that.
50
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,140
Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow?
51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,590
Yes. I have been working on it
for quite some time
52
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,590
and finally completed it 6 days ago.
53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,930
This flyer was distributed
not only in Hidden Leaf Village,
54
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,260
but in all the nearby
towns and villages as well.
55
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,550
You don’t say?
56
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,350
I’ve been away on a mission
and have only just returned…
57
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,590
Is that so?
58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,180
But why a Dojo?
59
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,590
It’s all for training.
60
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,550
For training?
61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,590
Well, actually, I’ve been busy
with missions lately
62
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,350
and have not been able to set aside
as much time for training as I’d like to.
63
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,850
And even on those occasions when
I was able to take time out…
64
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,720
it was difficult to find practice partners,
so I wasn’t able to train efficiently.
65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,510
Just when I was wondering
what I ought to do about it
66
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,850
YOUTH
I saw something in a village
I visited on a mission…
67
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,180
I request a challenge!
68
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,590
Please come this way.
69
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,890
Okay…
70
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,010
I have traveled near and far
in search of training…
71
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,510
I’d like to have a practice match.
72
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,550
But if I should win,
I’ll claim your marquee.
73
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,590
A Dojo challenge, huh?
Very well, I shall have a match with you.
74
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,050
Here I come!
75
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,590
If I were to open my own Dojo,
76
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,680
someone with confidence in his skills
will surely come to challenge me!
77
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,390
So, I opened the Dojo thinking
it would give me good practice,
78
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,390
but nobody has come
to challenge me yet…
79
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,140
Hmmm… Is that so?
80
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,140
Say, since you’re here, Naruto,
won’t you try out for a Dojo challenge?
81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,590
If you win,
I’ll give you the sign I painted myself.
82
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,720
I have no need for such things.
83
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,590
Don’t say that!
Please, by all means!
84
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,550
C-Come to think of it,
I forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade!
85
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,760
I’d better go right away!
86
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,930
See you later!
87
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Naruto!
88
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,350
Please be my first!
89
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,390
Damn it. I wasted so much time
thanks to Bushy Brow.
90
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,640
Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits.
91
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,260
I’d better steer clear of Bushy Brow’s Dojo
for the time being.
92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,510
What’s that I hear about Lee’s Dojo?
93
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,720
Intense Brow Sensei…?
94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,010
Naruto, what do you mean by that?
95
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,140
Do you mean to tell me
that he opened a Dojo to train himself
96
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,510
while I was away from the village
on a mission?
97
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,390
Splendid, if I may say so
about my own student!
98
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,180
I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved!
99
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,590
But the all-important Dojo challengers
are yet to appear… Not a single one.
100
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,260
Damn those Dojo challengers!
101
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,640
To think that Lee’s earnest hopes
have come to naught…
102
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,590
I’ll search high and low
and give them a hit they can not forget!
103
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,590
But, if you do that,
104
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,220
you’ll just make even less people
want to visit for a challenge.
105
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,050
Ah, that’s right…
Whatever shall I do then?!
106
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,850
I’ve got it. If no one come
to challenge his Dojo, then…
107
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,930
Why don’t I myself go to Lee’s Dojo,
disguised as a Dojo challenger?
108
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,930
I’ll play the part of Lee’s first!
109
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,590
A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself.
110
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,590
He wouldn’t dream that
this was me, no way.
111
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Here I come, Lee.
112
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,430
Guy Sensei!
113
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,970
I finally found you.
114
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,180
If it isn’t Sakura!
What is going on?
115
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,510
Guy, forgive me for bothering you
when you’ve only just returned, but…
116
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,550
an emergency relief request has come in
from Shikamaru’s squad,
117
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,590
which was assigned to
transport unit duty.
118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,930
We know nothing whatsoever about
the true nature and scale of the enemy.
119
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,600
Therefore…
120
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,590
there is a possibility of this developing
into something major
121
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,890
if we err in our initial encounter.
122
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,720
Judging from reports,
they should be around here.
123
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,590
They’re close by.
124
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,680
First, you go reconnoiter
to confirm the situation.
125
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,970
If they seem to need additional relief,
I will make immediate arrangements.
126
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,760
Yes, roger that.
127
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,590
Can that strange getup
have some significance?
128
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,590
I don’t know…
129
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,550
What’s with that strange fellow?
130
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,590
Well, no matter.
I’ll borrow his form
131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,590
to infiltrate Leaf Village.
132
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,890
The Village Hidden in the Leaves’
secrets…
133
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,590
I, Nanafushi,
shall investigate every last detail!
134
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,590
Was that guy really
looking for a Dojo challenge?
135
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,220
Yeah. That’s what he claimed to be,
so there can be no doubt.
136
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,010
He says he came
because he saw the flyers.
137
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,390
I wonder if he got lost or something…
138
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
Intense Brow Sensei, how long
do you intend to keep us waiting?
139
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,260
Naruto, I think, after all, I’d like
to have you be a Dojo challenger…
140
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,140
Oh no.
141
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,350
I’ll go look for him!
142
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Naruto!
143
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,350
Let’s work up a youthful sweat with me!
144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,590
Oh, he returned after all.
145
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,260
I knew that get up would be problematic.
146
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,470
What? 					What’s the problem?
147
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,590
Huh?
148
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,180
Sensei…?
What’s with the strange disguise?
149
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,640
Everyone can still tell it’s you!
150
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,590
I…I didn’t think it was
such a great idea, either.
151
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,590
What’s the matter?
152
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,590
Don’t tell me these guys
have discovered my true identify!
153
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,470
Intense Brow Sensei!
154
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,850
Sensei!
155
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,720
Oh!
156
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,100
Quit lollygagging
and get over to Lee's Dojo!
157
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,590
Huh?!
158
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,300
If you don’t go, then I’ll have to fight him!
Come on!
159
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Be seeing you…!
160
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,510
I guess you could say…
161
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,850
That’s typical of him…
162
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,220
I’m safe thanks to this guy…
163
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,180
I should attach myself to him for a while
and scope out the situation in the village.
164
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,590
What is this place?
165
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,590
This is Lee’s Dojo!
166
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,510
But, really… Couldn’t you have
come up with a little better disguise?
167
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,970
Well, never mind!
168
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,850
Lee must be tired of waiting,
so try to do a good acting job!
169
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,390
Acting?
What is he talking about?
170
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,100
I’ve brought him with me, Bushy Brow!
171
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,640
I’ve been waiting for you…!
172
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,640
Well then, please try to take down my Dojo!
173
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Huh…?
174
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,970
Please come this way!
175
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,930
Um…um.
176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,010
At time like this, you're supposed to say,
“I request a challenge match,” right?
177
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,890
I-I see…
178
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,680
I-I request a challenge match!
179
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,600
Do I hear that familiar call?
You indeed are a Dojo challenger!
180
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,590
Fair enough! If you win,
you can have my marquee!
181
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,720
Could it be that I’ve been
mistaken for a Dojo challenger?
182
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,430
Oh my god…
183
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,850
Huh?!
184
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,590
He’s just a kid…
185
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,890
Well, it can’t be helped.
I’ll go easy on him…
186
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,510
Okay! Here I come!
187
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,180
– Ready! 					– Huh?
188
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,590
He disappeared?
189
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,890
Huh…?
190
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,720
Wh-What happened…?
191
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,430
This little brat…!
192
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,390
Take that! And that!
And this! And that!
193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,680
He's strong!
194
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,430
What’s going on?!
195
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,590
I know you’re only acting, but you’re still
giving him too much of a break, Sensei.
196
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,590
Oh, I see. He’s not fighting back because
it’ll ruin his disguise!
197
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,260
Even if I had nine lives,
I’d never survive this fellow…
198
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,430
I think I’d better wave a white flag
and withdraw here.
199
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,720
I-I concede…
200
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,050
Then that means…I did it!
201
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,390
I splendidly fought off
my first Dojo challenger!
202
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,590
No, that’s not it at all!
203
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,390
What he means by “concede”
204
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,850
is that he concedes
to be a Dojo challenger, right?
205
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,720
In other words,
he’s just been warming up,
206
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,590
and now comes
the real challenge, right?
207
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,010
No, that’s not it at all!
208
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,470
So that's what you meant, after all…
209
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,680
I thought it was odd that
210
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,970
that an experienced Dojo challenger
would surrender.
211
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,590
It’s not odd!
There’s nothing odd about it at all!
212
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,930
Well, then, I’ll have to really
get down to business now, too!
213
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,970
What?! You mean you haven’t even
really gotten started yet?
214
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,260
Hey! Intense Brow Sensei
is a pretty good actor!
215
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,180
He’s even taking more hits so that
Bushy Brow won't know it's him.
216
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,180
What?
You were only attacked by monkeys?
217
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,970
They were after the snacks
that Choji procured
218
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,590
but the important load is safe!
219
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,590
My snacks… by a monkey…
220
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,680
Ino mistook that for
an enemy’s attack
221
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,430
and sent out
an emergency relief request.
222
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,590
But, it was so sudden!
223
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,550
Anyway, it’s your fault
for procuring so many snacks!
224
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,590
These snacks were available
only for a limited time,
225
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,590
and moreover,
only available in the Land of Tea,
226
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,970
the Super-rare
“Green tea Pork-flavored” chips!
227
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,640
For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sin
to refrain from buying
228
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,220
a limited offering of snacks
once one has found them!
229
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,970
Like I care about stuff like that!
230
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
What?
231
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
What?!
232
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,390
Shikamaru, things are tough for you,
aren't they?
233
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,640
Right back at you. That getup…
Did something happen?
234
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,050
Huh? What about my getup…?
235
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,050
Here.
236
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,590
Oh, that’s right!
I haven’t got time for dallying here!
237
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,470
I’ve got to get over to Lee’s dojo!
238
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,590
Just wait for me, Lee!
239
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,300
You’re overdoing
on purposefully getting beaten, Sensei…
240
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,590
Is he finished now?
241
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,300
Whoa, hold it! Time out!
242
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,850
Fight back a little, will you?!
243
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,220
It’s impossible, I tell you.
244
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,010
If Lee doesn’t
find this challenging enough,
245
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,350
I might get stuck being his opponent.
246
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,010
Actually…
247
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,430
It’s been one extreme mission
after another lately,
248
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,760
and I haven’t gotten any sleep at all…
249
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,260
What? You don’t say…
250
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,510
If I got a little rest,
I think I might recover, but…
251
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,590
While I take a rest,
won’t you be his opponent for a while?
252
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,140
What?!
253
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,470
I’m begging you!
254
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,930
Wh-What is that?
255
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,390
I’m coming, Lee!
256
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,590
G-Guy?
257
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,720
I thought he already entered the village
a while ago…
258
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,050
S-Sorry to keep you waiting!
259
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,600
You've weathered such an attack
and you're still undamaged…
260
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
You’re quite a fellow!
261
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,590
The world is vast…
262
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,260
To think that such
an awesome Dojo challenger exists!
263
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,590
It was worth building this Dojo!
264
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,140
There’s no way I could win
with only Taijutsu!
265
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,470
If that’s the case,
then I’ll fight my own way…
266
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,050
Here I come!
267
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,600
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
268
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,760
But, of course! He’s well acquainted
with Ninjutsu too!
269
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,140
Leaf Hurricane!
270
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,680
The real body is… right above me!
271
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,140
Primary Lotus!
272
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,260
Is this a clone, too?
273
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,590
Got you!
274
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,390
Here I go, one more time!
275
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,590
Another Shadow Clone?
276
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Nope…!
277
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,590
Stop it, Lee.
278
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,850
S-Sakura?
279
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,590
– Be nice, now!
– Don’t be too hard on me.
280
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,390
– Please! 					– Don’t be mean!
281
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,720
So many Sakura…
Guy Sensei! I’m moved!
282
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,010
I’ve never known such happiness
before in my life!
283
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,510
– Cha! 					– Cha!
284
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,850
Wha…?!
285
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,930
We did it!
286
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,390
I guess I forgot…
that this is a fight with a challenger.
287
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,550
Just as one might expect…
But I won’t fall for the same trick again!
288
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,930
Even though they may look like Sakura,
they’re really just phony Transformation!
289
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,430
How can you say that, Lee?
290
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,590
Hurry back, Sensei!
291
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,590
For brats,
they fight such a high-level fight…
292
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,430
– Leave it to Village Hidden in Leafs…
– How about this?!
293
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,850
I wonder if the rumors that
294
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,590
– they lost its vigor were just lies?
– In that case…
295
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,970
– I guess I need to
– Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
296
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,890
investigate this further…
297
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,260
This disguise is problematic…
298
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,590
I get a feeling
I will be embroiled in trouble again.
299
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,220
Let’s go with this.
Well then, shall I be taking my leave?
300
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,430
Hold it right there!
301
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
The real thing!
302
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,590
I see that you are Rock Lee,
master of this Dojo.
303
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,590
Oh no.
I guess I’ll have to play along with him…
304
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,800
Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee,
master of this dojo…
305
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,430
I am a Dojo challenger!
306
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,100
Rock Lee, I shall defeat you
and claim your marquee!
307
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,590
Here I come!
308
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,930
You fight a pretty good fight.
309
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,590
You, too…
310
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,600
H-Help!
311
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,180
B-Bushy Brow?!
312
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,510
Dynamic Entry!
313
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,140
A-Another Dojo challenger?!
314
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,590
Intense Brow Sensei!
What took you so long?!
315
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,350
N-Naruto…what's the meaning of this?
316
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,590
If you can’t dodge
even this much of an attack,
317
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,590
you are not worth all the talk!
318
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,590
Your training is inadequate!
319
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,140
N-No… This is… I mean…
320
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,680
It’s about Million years too early for you
to be building your own Dojo!
321
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,100
I must straighten that spoiled attitude
of yours with my own fist!
322
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,100
Forgive me Lee…
lt’s my whip of love!
323
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,590
So, the true identity of the challenger
was you, Guy Sensei!
324
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,470
What? You’re Lee?
Then, who was I punching?
325
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,300
Who’s that guy?
326
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,640
Good grief…
327
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,590
Come in! 					Oh, it’s you, Guy…
328
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,930
And you’re with Naruto and Lee.
329
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,640
That’s perfect.
I was just about to call you all.
330
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,140
Has something happened?
331
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,590
Just now, some intelligence came in…
332
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,640
A Shinobi from the Land of Valleys,
by the name of Nanafushi,
333
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,050
is said to have been seeking
inside information on our village.
334
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,180
He may already have
infiltrated the village.
335
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,180
I want you to go search for this Nanafushi
immediately and capture him…
336
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,930
Oh!
337
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,970
That man…
338
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,140
You have an idea of where he might be?
339
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,590
– It’s this guy!
– It’s this man!
340
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,470
I don’t really know what’s going on…
but our mission is complete!
341
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,970
Well then, we’ll be going.
342
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,140
Hey! Don’t just leave him here!
343
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh! Guy Sensei!
344
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,600
Explain what happened!
Hey! Lee! Hey! Naruto!
345
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,010
On a checkerboard night
346
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,590
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
347
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,010
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
348
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,180
Suggestively
349
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,930
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
350
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,590
The Trombone gradually going off-key
351
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,220
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
352
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,260
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
353
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,470
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
354
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,970
In the small hours of the morning
when the trees and grasses are asleep
355
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,590
and the forest is deathly calm…
356
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,350
A signpost standing forlorn
starts telling of the destruction of a clan.
357
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,300
Suddenly with a strike of thunder,
heavy rain begins to fall down.
358
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,550
What could be the true identity
of the Iron Castle that appeared?!
359
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,260
Next Time: “The Mysterious Curse
of the Haunted Castle”
//%
1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,890
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,810
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,890
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,230
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,770
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,400
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,890
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,440
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,980
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,020
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,650
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,900
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,100
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:19,890
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,850
It looks like
the preparations are complete.
16
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,730
So this is the Land of Greens
you were talking about, brother?
17
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,270
Well, it’s a small land,
18
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,400
but it could be a good stepping-stone
for getting ahead in the world.
19
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,770
We’ve already bought off
half of the public officials.
20
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,310
This land will be overturned
on our signal.
21
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,850
As of today,
we’re the feudal lords of this land.
22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,600
Feudal lords, huh…?
23
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,270
That has a nice ring to it.
24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,060
Open for Business!
The Leaf Moving Service
25
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,890
This is a problem…
26
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,230
I thought about testing out
various combinations, but it backfired.
27
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,900
With these remaining members,
there’s nobody who can take the lead…
28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,600
But it’s merchant protection this time,
29
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,690
so no matter who goes,
there probably isn’t much to worry about.
30
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,190
Mission difficulty isn’t the issue.
31
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,100
It’s a commission from
the Land of Greens.
32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,770
I wanted to send them
a respectable team.
33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,890
The lord of the castle there
was good to me in the old days!
34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,770
True indeed…
35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,190
He generously assumed the debts
for the bundle you blew on gambling.
36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,810
It’s small,
but it’s a nice and easygoing land.
37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,890
There was an adorable princess,
and two boy Ninja looked after her…
38
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,850
At that time,
they both said they’d marry me…
39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,940
I wonder if they still feel that way…
40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,890
I don’t think so.
41
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,600
I bet they’ve all gotten big…
42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,890
We’ll be at the border soon.
43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,890
This is our last look at this scenery
for a while.
44
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,890
All right!
A mission, a mission!
45
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,400
Wait up, Naruto!
46
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,850
Everyone else was off on missions,
47
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,440
but I've been doing nothing but
odd jobs in the village!
48
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,060
I was sick of hearing stories
about everyone’s adventures.
49
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,230
Still,
we’re guarding merchants this time.
50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,310
It ‘s probably not something
to brag about.
51
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,520
Then I should exaggerate
the story a bit
52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,400
and say that I took out
about a thousand bandits, right?
53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,890
That’s just lying…
54
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,850
Oh! There they are.
That’s them!
55
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,520
Yahoo!
56
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,520
Who’re you?
57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,600
You guys are merchants
from the Land of Greens, right?
58
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,900
That’s right.
59
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,730
We’ve come from
the Village Hidden in Leaves
60
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,350
to protect you guys.
Believe it.
61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,850
The Village Hidden in Leaves?
62
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,060
See…? 					This, this.
63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,650
We were told to protect you
from mountain bandits…
64
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,810
It’s for certain.
65
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,520
I’m Naruto Uzumaki.
66
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,520
And this is Hinata.
67
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,440
I’m Choji Akimichi.
68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,060
Um, we received one more item
from the Hokage
69
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,400
to identify ourselves with.
70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,810
Hey, Momiji.
71
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,900
Give it back.
72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,900
Oh, it’s true.
73
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,940
These people are from
the Village of the Hidden Leaf.
74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,020
See…?
74.01	01:30:15:10	01:30:17:11	The Leaf Moving Service
75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,440
Wh-What’s that?
76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,850
Old lady Tsunade…
she’s done it this time!
77
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:26,890
I see.
78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,480
I’m Kikusuke.
79
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,150
This is Yurinoshin.
80
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,890
He’s Shun.
81
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,190
I’m Momiji!
We’ll be counting on you movers!
82
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,150
You sure eat a lot.
83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,190
That’s why you're so f…
84
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,810
Fa?!
85
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,810
…full figured.
86
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,890
For you.
87
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,890
I love people with great strength.
88
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,270
Something like this is a cinch.
89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,690
See? Watch.
90
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,520
Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll…
91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,940
Somebody help me!
92
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,560
That Choji, getting all carried away.
93
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,770
Move faster, mover.
94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,890
We’re rapidly falling behind.
95
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,980
We’re not movers, I’m telling you.
96
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,900
Why don’t you help out
before complaining?!
97
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,480
No, it’s fine.
98
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,810
Our cousin Shun is in poor health.
99
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,100
You don’t need to worry,
Kikusuke, Yurinoshin.
100
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,310
I had no intention of
listening to anything
101
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,150
this good-for-nothing has had to say
from the start.
102
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,230
Who’s a good-for-nothing?!
Just you watch!
103
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,690
Honestly,
it’s because you push yourself too far…
104
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,770
I’m sorry…
Shun’s being unreasonable.
105
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,150
Water! 					Oh.
106
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,440
Mine’s empty, too.
107
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,230
Then there’s some fresh drawn water.
108
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,810
Here!
109
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,980
Wow,
how’d you find water in a place like this?
110
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,770
My grandma taught me.
111
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,940
Your grandma?
112
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,730
It's this…
113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,890
You can tell with this.
114
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,270
What?! 					With those?
115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,230
It’s called dousing.
116
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,400
If you concentrate
on the item you’re looking for…
117
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,480
these rods will react to that item
and will inform you when you're near it.
118
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,770
It’s knowledge passed on
from our predecessors.
119
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,810
When I get back to the village,
120
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,190
maybe I'll try to find money
that people dropped with that.
121
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,900
Tasty!
122
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,190
It doesn’t compare to the water
in the Land of Greens, but it's good water.
123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,230
Come to think of it,
what kind of place is the Land of Greens?
124
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,980
The Land of Greens is…
a small land deep in the mountains.
125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,400
Everyone in the land loves nature
and is warm-hearted.
126
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,150
It was indeed Shangri-La…
127
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,600
Was…?
128
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,770
Oh, it’s nothing…
129
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,270
But, you know, if it’s such a great place,
why do you need protection?
130
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,270
It’s targeted because
the people take peace for granted!
131
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,310
What do you mean by that?
132
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,850
Stuff like loving nature
and being warm-hearted sounds nice.
133
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,520
But the bottom line is that the people
in the Land of Greens are all softhearted.
134
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,600
We live in a troubled time now.
135
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,100
Something like believing in people
is ridiculous.
136
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,770
Hey, the Land of Greens
is not something to speak ill of like that.
137
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,600
The lord of the castle there was kind
even to us merchants passing through.
138
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,480
To think he’d take up that kind of attitude
with an old lady…
139
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,890
He’s kind of disagreeable.
140
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,190
He’s your cousin, right?
Do something about him.
141
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,940
R-Right.
142
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,980
He’s probably a bit touchy
from the bad things that have happened.
143
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,190
I’m sorry…
144
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,900
Oh, i-it’s okay…
145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,560
Hey, that’s dangerous.
146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,890
It’s dangerous
to wander around alone.
147
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,560
Brother Choji, look at that…
148
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,890
Naruto!
149
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,940
What is it?
150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,980
That.
151
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,270
Wh-What is that?
152
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,230
That’s in the direction of
the Land of Greens, right?!
153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,100
I’m going to go check it out…
You take the others and go on ahead.
154
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,890
I’ll be right back.
155
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,350
Listen.
156
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,150
What we saw here is a secret.
157
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,690
We don’t want everyone to get worried.
158
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,060
Yeah. 					Got it.
159
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,270
Huh? Where’s Naruto?
160
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,890
Th-The bathroom…
161
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,770
I’ll give this to you
if you tell me what you saw earlier.
162
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,690
Black smoke… 					was rising.
163
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,690
Black smoke…?! 					From where?
164
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,560
The direction of the Land of Greens.
165
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,020
Lord Shun…
166
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,350
It’s finally…
167
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,150
I should be at the Land of Greens
border pretty soon.
168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,890
Wh-What was that …?
There was no presence at all.
169
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,100
Who’re you guys!
170
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,060
Who’re you guys?
171
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,890
That headband. You’re with
the Hidden Leaf Village, right?
172
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,440
So what if I am?
Why are you targeting me?
173
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,020
I have no intention
of fighting you guys.
174
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,310
It seems the ones we are looking for
are heading this direction, you see.
175
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,890
Those who prowl around here will die.
176
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,150
Did we do it…?
177
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,900
The Substitution Jutsu?!
178
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,150
The real one is over here!
179
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,270
These guys are pretty good.
180
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,060
Two left.
181
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,020
One of them is the real one!
182
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,060
What?!
183
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,890
Too bad!
Those two are also clones.
184
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,890
I’m going to turn back for now…
185
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,810
Choji! Hinata!
186
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,690
How’d it go, Naruto?
187
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,310
Actually, there’s trouble…
188
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,890
Guys! Let’s take a break here
for the time being!
189
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,900
Pursuers from the Land of Greens?
190
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,520
They said that…
191
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,650
The ones they were looking for
were headed in this direction.
192
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,730
But why would Ninja
be after this group?
193
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,150
These people are just merchants,
aren’t they?
194
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,560
And they’re not even people
from the Land of Greens to begin with…
195
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,020
Now that you mention it,
that’s right.
196
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,060
But what will we do?
197
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,850
We’re going to engage them if they come,
of course.
198
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,560
That might be impossible…
199
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,400
We have elderly people
and children with us.
200
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,650
You’re right…
201
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,020
I know.
202
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,980
It could be that
they’re not chasing after us!
203
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,310
What do you mean by that?
204
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,890
Basically, we’re moving
in the same direction as their true target
205
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,060
and we could just be
in their battle ground…or something.
206
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,690
I see.
207
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,270
That means if we clear the path,
they’ll let us go right by.
208
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,150
Alright.
209
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,890
Listen up, guys!
210
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,020
Some kind of troublesome guys
are heading this way.
211
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,480
Troublesome guys?
212
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,650
Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxious
if you say it like that.
213
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,890
I-I see…
214
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,810
But you don’t need to worry.
215
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,900
They’re probably not after us…
216
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,060
It’ll kind of be the long way around,
217
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,270
but we’ll make it through
if we take a little side turn up ahead.
218
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,150
Does this feudal lord really have this little?
219
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,890
He’s a feudal lord
who’s a prestigious ruler of virtue.
220
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,730
So he would never line his pockets.
221
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,890
But we’ll squeeze out a big pile
from now on.
222
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,690
More importantly, has
the young girl in question been found?
223
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,730
Nope…
224
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,770
But the two who were tracking her
got attacked.
225
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,560
We know the direction she fled in.
226
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,890
That young girl just would not be good.
227
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,770
If they get away, they may return
with forces from other lands.
228
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,600
If the sun were a little stronger,
229
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,440
I could burned down a whole mountain
with my Jutsu…
230
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,560
Then I’ll go…
231
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,890
Lord Renga, I gathered all collaborators
in the hall as you ordered…
232
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,100
Oh, good work.
233
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,310
Without your guys’ help, we couldn’t have
brought down the castle this easily …
234
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,600
Then brother,
shall we go for the hall greeting?
235
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,940
Okay… I’ll take care of things here.
236
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,850
So, about the thing you promised…
237
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,060
Oh, that’s right.
238
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,020
Take as much there as you like.
239
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,650
Really?
240
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,230
Honestly. It’s so easy to deceive
softhearted people…
241
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,850
It really is exactly so.
242
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,520
Our lord believed in us
until the very end…
243
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,650
Come on.
244
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,560
If you stuff that much in there,
the ferry on death’s river will sink.
245
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,890
I make it a habit not to believe in people.
246
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,850
Especially people
who have betrayed someone once…
247
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,020
Y-You’re joking, Lord Renga…
248
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,480
It’s no joke.
249
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,190
C-Could it be that you had me
gather the collaborators in the coup to…
250
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,350
You’re also softhearted!
251
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,230
That should do it.
252
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,350
Yurinojou, it seems they’re after us.
253
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,100
Yes.
254
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,600
I leave Lady Haruna to you.
255
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,020
What are you going to do?
256
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,440
If we wait here for their attack,
there will be too many to defend.
257
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,980
Since it’s come to this,
I’ll slow them down.
258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,440
But according to the information,
259
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,940
they are three Janin
who use unknown Jutsu.
260
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,400
I know.
261
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,940
But my Jutsu will not be defeated
by the likes of them.
262
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,310
Very well.
263
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,150
Go, Kikunojou.
264
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,520
Yes, Lady Haruna.
265
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,940
Naruto.
266
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,650
I set a trap for the time being.
267
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,980
Jeez, Hinata.
You’re such a worrywart.
268
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,690
You don’t need to go that far.
269
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,890
Huh? Yurinoshin,
where’s Kikusuke?
270
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,890
You’re right. 					Since when…?
271
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,730
Oh, he had some other business
and went on ahead…
272
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,150
Say what? Taking liberties like that
is really a problem…
273
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,890
Oh, I see.
274
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,310
So that’s it, huh?
275
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,890
What is it?
276
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,310
Even Kikusuke makes sure
to go to the bathroom.
277
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,600
Naruto…!
278
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,480
Lady Haruna, I shall protect you
with my life!
279
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,650
There!
280
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,230
Who’re you…?!
281
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,440
I’m Ruiga.
282
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,190
To think you’d
just come right on out nonchalantly.
283
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,520
Then she must in that group, right?
284
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,310
If it’s one against one,
I won’t lose to a hired Ninja like you!
285
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,890
Can you do it?
286
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,810
Have a taste of
the Land of Greens’ Flower Ninja Art!
287
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,690
Eat this! Flower Shuriken!
Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage!
288
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,270
Too easy…
289
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,020
I don’t know about that!
290
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,100
Flower Ninja Art: Release!
Myriad of Flowers!
291
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,940
Ninja Art: Mirror Flower Water Moon!
292
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,730
Flowers made of Letter Bombs, huh?
Futile, futile!
293
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,230
And Genjutsu next, huh?
294
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,100
This is the finishing blow.
295
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,900
Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!
Myriad of Flowers!
296
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,230
Too bad.
297
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,350
The Ninjutsu of a Flower Ninja
can’t beat me.
298
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,520
Now it’s my turn!
299
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,230
Eat this.
300
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,770
Water Style: Liquid Memory!
301
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,310
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
302
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,900
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
303
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,650
Yellow Moon.
304
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,480
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
305
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,690
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
306
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:10,650
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
307
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:17,520
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
308
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:24,230
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
309
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:30,940
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
310
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,770
A magical chord change, in a restless city
311
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,810
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
312
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,650
A running-ramen strategy, huh?
313
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,020
In other words, we split up
in order to avoid annihilation, right?
314
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,890
With this,
the protection burden will decrease.
315
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,190
But won’t the soup spill if it runs?
316
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,480
This is an example.
317
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,150
It’d still be trouble
even if it’s just an example, believe it.
318
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,230
Then, let’s make it
the running-ramen-with-a-lid strategy.
319
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,310
If you say so, Naruto.
320
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,980
I mean, do you really understand
the strategy, Naruto?
321
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,190
Next time:
“Mystery of the Targeted Merchants.”
//%
1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,660
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,630
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,900
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,310
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,980
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,710
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,520
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,490
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,730
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,530
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,030
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,400
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,370
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,810
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,380
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,890
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,520
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,590
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,600
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,770
I think we almost finished
shaking off the losers.
21
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,500
Then I guess I'll move
onto the main issue.
22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,900
It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.
23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,170
All right!
24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,180
Here is the tenth question!
25
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,010
Here it comes!
26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,350
I have to put everything on
the line for this question!
27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,420
The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!
28
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,530
Hmph! Making such a big deal.
29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,930
This is the final obstacle.
30
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,940
Kankuro, come back already!
31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,940
If he starts the tenth question,
your cheat sheet has no meaning!
32
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,740
But before that,
33
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm going to add
some rules for the last question.
34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,530
Aren't you lucky?
35
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,070
It looks like playing with
the dolls wasn't a waste, after all?
36
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,600
This guy.
37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,970
He's figured Crow out!
38
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,410
Anyway, sit down.
39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,030
Let me explain!
40
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,530
These are
41
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,970
the hopeless rules!
42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,970
Well, anyhow.
43
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,510
There's nothing to do when
the subordinates are gone, huh?
44
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,510
Well, it'll get busy soon enough.
45
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,110
Why?
46
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,480
This year's first proctor...
47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,950
I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.
48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,190
Well then, passing the first exam
already seems iffy.
49
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,900
Of all the people, that sadist...
50
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,530
Sadist?
51
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,970
Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,
so you wouldn't know.
52
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,410
Who is this person?
53
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,080
He is a pro, a professional.
54
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,150
Professional? Of what?
55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,320
Torture and interrogation.
56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,490
What?!
57
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,630
Well, there maybe no physical torture
in the exam itself,
58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,570
but he's sure to use his
his skills as an interrogator
59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,640
to torment them psychologically.
60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,670
That is...
61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,510
Leaf Village Anbu's
Torture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,
62
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,510
Ibiki Morino!
63
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,520
Hopeless rules...?!
64
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,490
First, you guys will have to choose
65
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,530
whether or not you will take
this 10th question!
66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,900
Huh?!
67
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,500
Choose whether or not
to take the exam?
68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,670
What, choose?!
69
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,510
What happens if you choose not
to take the 10th exam?
70
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,710
If you chose not to take the exam,
then your score will be zero.
71
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,650
In other words, you fail!
72
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,520
And of course, the same goes for
the two others in the same group!
73
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,160
W-What does that mean!
74
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,690
Of course, everybody is going to
choose to take the exam!
75
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,430
This is ridiculous!
As if we have a choice!
76
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,700
And... one more rule...
77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,070
Another one?!
78
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,900
Finish with it already!
79
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,510
If you chose to take it and
are unable to answer it correctly,
80
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,180
then you will have to...
81
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,780
relinquish your right
of taking the Chunin Exam forever.
82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,190
What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!
83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,020
Besides, there are plenty
of people here
84
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,930
who have taken the
Chunin Exam many times!
85
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,900
You're just unlucky.
86
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,310
I make the rule this year.
87
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,850
But I did give you
the option to go back!
88
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,620
For those of you who aren't confident,
you can choose not to take it
89
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,520
and take the exam
next year or the year after that.
90
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,690
Oh! How terrible!
91
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,660
If one out of the three
chooses not to take the exam,
92
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,130
then all three will be failed.
93
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,570
If you do choose to take it,
but get the wrong answer...
94
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,410
then that person will be a
Genin for the rest of their life!
95
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,080
No matter what,
the odds are against us!
96
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,850
It's an impossible choice
for anyone with normal nerves!
97
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,990
Then, let's begin...
98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,160
The 10th question…
99
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,030
Those who will not be taking it,
raise your hands!
100
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,530
Once I confirm your number,
I'll ask you to leave!
101
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,510
What kind of a question
is it going to be….?
102
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,510
Darn!
103
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,080
If I get it wrong,
I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.
104
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,210
I don't want that!
105
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,510
But if I choose not take it...!
106
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,620
then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too!
I don't want that either!
107
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,320
I won't raise my hand!
108
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,290
I'm confident that
I can answer it correctly.
109
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,190
But…
110
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,930
But Naruto! You're different!
111
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,470
You should retreat this time
even if it means to ignore us
112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
and think of your next chance
to take the Exam!
113
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,580
I... I...
114
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,850
I'm quitting!
I'm not going to take it!
115
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,820
#50 failed!
116
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,990
# 130, #111 will be
failed as well...
117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,530
I-I'm sorry...
Gennai! Inaho!
118
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,630
Darn...
119
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,530
M-Me too!
120
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,300
Me too!
121
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Naruto...
122
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Why don't you raise your hand?
123
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,760
That guy...
124
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,160
I am the super elite ninja
125
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,930
who will be carrying
the name of the Hokage!
126
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,200
My name is Naruto Uzumaki,
remember that!
127
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,500
Shut up!
128
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm prepared to do anything
to become a Hokage!
129
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,540
I will surpass the Hokage!
130
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,580
And I will make all of
the people in the village
131
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,220
acknowledge my presence!
132
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,390
He's always got such a one-track mind.
133
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,890
Saying Hokage, Hokage
all the time like a fool.
134
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,760
I'm sorry, Naruto.
135
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,200
It seems like...
136
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,430
I don't want to...
137
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,440
crush your unachievable dreams.
138
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,410
That guy...
139
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,520
Ibiki completely understands how
the human psyche works.
140
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,520
And the most horrifying part is...
141
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,860
that by cornering people psychologically
he controls their psyche and
142
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,930
reveals the fundamental
weakness of a human.
143
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,350
Don't underestimate me!
I won't run!
144
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,080
I'll take it!
145
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,650
But even if I'm stuck being
a Genin forever,
146
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,520
I will  become a Hokage
no matter what it takes!
147
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,730
I'm not scared!
148
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,370
That guy, he wasn't even
thinking of us at all.
149
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,610
Such audacity!
150
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,440
That's right…
151
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,680
That's exactly the kind of fool you are!
152
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,620
I'll ask again.
153
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,420
It's a choice that will alter your life.
154
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,890
If you want to quit, now is your chance!
155
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,430
I'm not going to take back
my words!
156
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,530
That is my Way of Ninja!
157
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,340
Huh... What a funny kid.
158
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,510
He completely brushed away
those kids' anxieties.
159
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,050
78, huh? Much more left
than I expected.
160
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,920
It's going to be the same.
No matter how much more I push it.
161
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
I like your determination!
162
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,530
Then...
163
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
For those who are still here...
164
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,240
The first exam...
165
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,340
You have passed it!
166
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,550
Huh?
167
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,490
H-Hey, what does that mean?
168
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
All of a sudden you're telling us
that we've passed!
169
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,930
What about the 10th question?
170
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,330
There wasn't such
a thing to begin with!
171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,030
Well, you can look at the choice you
just had to make as the 10th question!
172
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,240
What?!
173
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,440
Hey!
174
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,110
Then, what were all
those nine questions for!
175
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,510
It was just a waste of time!
176
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,040
Not a waste...
177
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,120
The objective of the nine questions
were already accomplished.
178
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,890
To test your individual ability
to gather information!
179
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Ability to gather information?
180
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,530
First…
181
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,260
The focus of this test was
182
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,530
on the system of determining
the pass or failure
183
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,040
based on the three-person groups
that was proposed in the first rule.
184
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,310
By grading the exam on
a group basis,
185
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,180
I added the unimaginable pressure
of dragging down your teammates.
186
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,810
I see, I see.
187
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,280
I kind of felt that was
the point of this test!
188
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,450
No , you didn't!
189
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,860
However...
190
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,490
The questions on these tests weren't
things that
191
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,330
you Genin Ninja would
have been able to solve...
192
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,530
So in that case…
193
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,540
I imagined that most of you here
would have come to this conclusion:
194
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,910
"In order to score points,
I'll have to cheat."
195
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,770
In other words,
196
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,110
this exam was created under the premise
that you all would cheat!
197
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,820
That being said,
198
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,960
I had two Chunin in the group
who knew all of the answers
199
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,130
from whom you could cheat.
200
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,870
What?! That's what it was?
201
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,500
I had a hard time figuring
out the guy.
202
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,270
Yeah. Really...
203
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,440
It was so obvious!
204
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,510
There's something wrong with you
if you didn't notice!
205
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,150
Right, Hinata?!
206
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,520
He... didn't realize it...
207
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,320
However...
208
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,520
those who just foolishly cheated,
naturally were disqualified.
209
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,060
That's because...
210
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,030
Information, depending on
the time and situation,
211
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,530
it will be more valuable than life.
212
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,570
And in a mission or on a battlefield,
213
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,270
you will always have to risk your life
to fight for it!
214
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,450
Horrible burn marks, nail punctures
and scratches...
215
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,520
Those are signs of physical torture!
216
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,390
When information is gathered
217
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,520
and the enemy or a third party
finds out about it,
218
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,030
that information is no longer
guaranteed to be correct.
219
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,400
Just remember this.
220
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,600
To be given the wrong information
221
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,540
can bring a catastrophic blow
to your friends and town.
222
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,210
So that is why, out of necessity,
we forced you guys to cheat
223
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,580
in order to test your ability
to collect information.
224
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,520
And we filtered out those who
were clearly lacking in those abilities.
225
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,290
But...
226
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,590
The last question doesn't
make any sense.
227
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,390
However...
228
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,770
this 10th question was
the main issue of this first exam.
229
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:29,900
Huh?
230
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,240
What do you mean?
231
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,970
I'll explain.
232
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,110
The tenth question was to
take on the question, or not.
233
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,810
Needless to say, it is
a painful decision to make.
234
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,850
Those who chose not to
take on the question,
235
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,320
would be immediately failed
along with their whole squad!
236
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,720
Those who chose to answer
the question and got it wrong…
237
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,530
would be robbed of their chance
to take the Exam forever.
238
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,200
It really is an unfair question.
239
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,240
Then, how about these two choices?
240
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,640
Let's say that you guys did
become a Chunin.
241
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,440
The mission is to steal
a secret document!
242
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,510
You have no idea how many
Ninjas the enemy has,
243
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,980
their ability, and other armament
they may have.
244
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,160
On top of that, there maybe
the pitfall of an enemy trap.
245
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,490
Now this mission...
Will you take it? Or not take it?
246
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,460
Because you want your life spared...
247
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,960
Because your partners will
be put in danger...
248
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,070
Can you get away from
dangerous missions?
249
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,140
The answer is...
250
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,040
No!
251
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,780
There are going to be missions
you cannot avoid
252
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,810
no matter how risky or
dangerous it may be!
253
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,280
Showing your courage to
your teammates in a tight spot,
254
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,150
and the ability to get through
the hardships...
255
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,060
This is the quality that is needed
in a Chunin troop leader!
256
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,070
In a pinch, there are
those who cannot risk their own fate,
257
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,410
and those who waver and give up
their chances
258
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,510
because they think they
will have another chance.
259
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,520
I believe that such fools who don't have
strong determination
260
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,120
have no right to become a Chunin!
261
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
For those of you who chose
to take on the question,
262
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,690
you can say that you have successfully
answered the difficult 10th question!
263
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,530
You shall be able to take on
the adversity that may lie in your way.
264
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,070
You've passed through the gates!
265
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,770
The fist exam for the Chunin Exam
has been completed.
266
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,810
I wish you well!
267
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,610
All right! Wish us well!
268
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,380
I did it! I did it! 					Yeaah!
269
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,520
What a funny guy...
270
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,070
W-What's going on?!
271
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,300
Gosh, this one...
272
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,170
You guys!
273
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,110
This isn't the time to be
celebrating!
274
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,880
I'm the proctor for the second exam!
Anko Mitarashi!
275
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,220
Let's move onto
the next stage! Next!
276
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Follow me!
277
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,530
Read the atmosphere.
278
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,130
This proctor...
ls kind of like Naruto.
279
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,870
78?! Ibiki!
You let 26 teams slide by?
280
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,980
I guess, the first exam this time around
was too easy.
281
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,850
It seems like this time,
there are a lot of excellent candidates.
282
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,980
Huh! Well, all right...
283
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,720
I'll drop more than half of them
in the second exam!
284
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,660
M-More than half?
285
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm getting excited.
286
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,530
I'll give you the details tomorrow.
287
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,230
We'll be changing locations,
288
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,440
so get information from your Jonin
about the location and the time!
289
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,110
That's it. You're dismissed.
290
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,530
I didn't think that there would be a guy
that would pass with a blank sheet.
291
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,500
Naruto Uzumaki...
He really is a funny guy.
292
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,680
W-What is this place?!
293
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,680
NO TRESPASSING
294
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,690
This is the location for
the "second exam",
295
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,560
the 44th Training Field.
296
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,890
Also known as... the Forest of Death.
297
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,530
The Forest of... Death?!
298
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,230
I passed the first exam!
299
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,230
I'm just going to hop, jump
and take a big step and...
300
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,400
Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?
301
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,770
Hey, you guys!
302
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,510
if you want to play a Ninja game...
303
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,010
No? What?
You came here for a mission?!
304
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,520
Next episode:
"Special Report:
Live from the Forest of Death!"
305
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,520
As for me, I'm going to kick-butt again!
//%
1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,160
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,030
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,200
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,650
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,660
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,660
Now
12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,450
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,790
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,660
Ugh... what are you here for now?
20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,190
It’s our reunion after so long,
and you’re awfully cold.
21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,700
Don’t tell me that you came to
assassinate Lord Hokage?
22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,670
No, no…
23
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,640
I don’t have enough
subordinates for that yet...
24
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,640
I’ve heard of the excellence ones
of this village
25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,310
and thought I’d put dibs on them.
26
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,450
A little while ago, I gave that
same Curse Mark as a present.
27
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,650
There’s a kid that I want.
28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,820
Selfish as always.
29
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,930
That kid will die.
30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,660
Certainly…
31
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,660
The odds are 1 in 10
that he’ll survive,
32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,730
but he may survive just like you did.
33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,440
This kid, you really like him, huh?
34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,270
Are you jealous?
35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,810
Are you still holding a grudge that
I used you and threw you away?
36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,650
Unlike you, that kid will excel...
37
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,860
For one thing, he inherited
the Uchiha ability.
38
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,660
He has beautiful features
39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,530
and is a vessel who
can become my heir.
40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,770
If that kid lived,
it makes things interesting.
41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,070
Be sure not to cancel this test.
42
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,310
Three from my village are also
under your care…
43
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,650
Make me enjoy it.
44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,520
If something happens
to deprive me of my fun,
45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,190
consider it the end of Leaf Village.
46
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,580
We’ve secured food and water
after spending half a day.
47
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,020
And now most teams have halted activity.
48
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,090
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.
49
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,160
We'll split up into three
and go scouting.
50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,660
However, whether we find
other teams or not,
51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,400
we return to this place.
52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,660
Got it?
53
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,970
Okay.
54
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,900
Roger.
55
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,640
Okay. Scatter!
56
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,750
Bushy-Brow’s Pledge:
Undying Love and Protection!
57
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,640
I can’t fall asleep...
58
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,610
I need to protect these two.
59
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
I slept great!
60
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,060
Naruto!
61
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,660
Sasuke!
62
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,100
Did you take care of us?
63
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,060
Thank you, Sakura!
64
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,370
We’re totally better because of you!
65
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
That’s good...
66
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,650
A prey must always stay tense
and flee desperately
67
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,650
in front of the predator!
68
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,600
My voice is gone!
69
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,740
It was just a dream...
70
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,020
Is it daybreak already?!
71
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,490
No, no way!
72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,570
A squirrel?
73
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,810
Don’t surprise me like that!
74
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,110
Oh!
75
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,410
That was too close.
76
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,650
Do you think she noticed?
77
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,980
The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...
78
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,290
No, that’s not it.
79
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,020
Huh? Then what? What was it?
80
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,790
We’ll probably find out if we go closer.
81
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,460
So... we should get going now.
82
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,590
If I can catch all twenty of these leaves
before they hit the ground
83
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,660
Sakura will start to like me.
84
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,430
If... if I can’t catch
even one of the leaves...!
85
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,470
It’ll be an unanswered love forever.
Or rather…
86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,730
You’re too Bushy!
87
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,630
That’s what she’ll say.
88
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,640
One, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight...
89
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,040
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,810
nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen...
91
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,080
One more!
92
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,420
That’s…!
93
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,290
Phew... just in time.
94
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,500
This is called a Paper Bomb
and it explodes after some time.
95
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,640
Who did such an awful thing?
96
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,310
Stop hiding and come out.
97
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!
98
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,420
Man, he’s a damn pain
and we've been discovered!
99
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,490
Strategy One, “hide and let it pass,”
was a failure!
100
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,530
So now we carry out Strategy Two!
101
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,460
Huh? Are you serious?
102
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,000
What? You have a problem with that?
103
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,400
There’s no question of success.
104
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,310
Well, I guess it’s all right but...
105
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,650
Wow! To meet last year’s Number One
rookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!
106
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,150
C-Can I have your autograph?
107
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,020
So it’s just you guys?
108
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,760
Take that! Strategy Two, “head over heals
infatuation with my sex appeal”!
109
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,300
I’d been wanting to meet you
for some time, you know?
110
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,030
Get lost!
111
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,600
Why? Why doesn’t my sexiness work?!
112
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,310
Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!
113
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,110
Did you just raise your fists to me,
and does that mean you want to fight?
114
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,780
N-No... 					Of course not.
115
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,650
Then get lost.
116
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,660
Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps
like you
117
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,990
would only make me
the laughing stock of the village.
118
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,830
Y-Yes!
119
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,660
Huh... Really just like cockroaches.
120
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,410
Just as I thought.
121
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,940
A fellow like that wouldn’t take
a scroll away from wimps like us
122
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,250
unless we were to turn on him.
123
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,580
All right! Let’s go find some wimps!
124
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,150
Like I’ve been saying
there’s no one wimpier than us...
125
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,230
So a no-sleep lookout?
126
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,940
But it’s not necessary anymore.
127
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,910
Wake Sasuke up.
We want to battle with him.
128
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,080
Y-You bastards…
129
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,650
What’re you saying?
130
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,520
What is it you’re after?
131
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,660
I know the one called Orochimaru
is calling the shots from the shadows!
132
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,790
Huh?!
133
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,960
What’s that strange bruise on
the back of Sasuke’s neck?
134
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,730
You did this to Sasuke.
135
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,460
How can you say you want to fight him?!
136
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,900
I wonder…what he has on his mind?
137
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
However, I can’t stay quiet
after hearing that.
138
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,980
I will kill this girl,
I’ll also kill this Sasuke character.
139
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,190
Wait, Zaku.
140
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,750
Huh? What is it?
141
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,960
It’s so cliché.
142
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,600
It’s the color of dirt
that’s just been dug up.
143
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,900
This grass, it doesn’t grow in
a place like this, does it?
144
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Darn!
145
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,640
You know, with a trap...
146
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,040
there’s no point unless you
make it so it’s not discovered.
147
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,580
Huh, how ridiculous!
148
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,250
So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel
wouldn’t be caught in the trap ?
149
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,120
We kill her now!
150
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,160
A log?!
151
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,660
A trap above too? Watch out!
152
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,100
Just kidding.
153
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,260
What?!
154
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,030
Clearly you have no talent.
155
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,570
Someone like you needs to
make more of an effort or else!
156
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,040
Leaf Hurricanes!
157
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,420
What?! This guy...
158
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,620
Then you also should... make an effort!
159
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,660
Who are you?
160
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,690
I’m the beautiful blue beast
of Leaf Village, Rock Lee!
161
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,380
Why are you here?
162
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,640
I will always appear...
163
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,650
whenever you’re in trouble!
164
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,490
Or should I say...
165
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,020
It was really because of you,
now run along.
166
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,370
But right now, I’m also
your enemy!
167
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,640
I did say this once before, didn’t I?
168
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,910
That I’ll protect you until I die.
169
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,980
Please go out with me!
170
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,650
I’ll protect you until I die!
171
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,520
Oh...
172
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,150
T-Thanks.
173
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,590
Yes!
174
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,220
Perfect! I did it!
Gu Sensei, that was perfect!
175
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,330
I guess it can’t be helped...
176
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,030
Zaku. I’ll give you Sasuke.
177
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,540
I will kill them!
178
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,210
As far as I can tell,
Sakura is in no condition to fight.
179
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,650
That Bushy-Brow guy is
pretty proficient with Taijutsu...
180
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,750
Looks like I can have some fun!
181
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,660
There is a trick to your attack, isn’t there?
182
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,800
I won’t just simply avoid it.
183
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,670
You showed me your Jutsu before.
184
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,540
This guy…he’s strong.
185
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,940
Having said that,
186
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,780
the odds aren’t good since
it’s one versus three.
187
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,780
I’m gonna have to take a chance.
188
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,650
One person at a time...
189
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,520
I’ll give it my all and take each down!
190
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,660
There’s no one at all that seems wimpy!
191
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,640
Well, the only team that’s weaker
than us is the Naruto team.
192
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,810
Idiot! You know what you’re saying?
193
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,640
What?!
194
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,110
No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!
195
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,950
But that team has
the super genius Sasuke!
196
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,310
Hah! I wonder...
197
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,320
In actual battle that genius
might easily be beaten.
198
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,650
What?!
199
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,660
All right, all right,
I apologize for irritating you.
200
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,960
What a pain...
201
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:56,030
I say one negative thing about
Sasuke and I get the evil eye, every time…
202
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,640
There’s no way Sasuke
could be taken down!
203
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,670
Sakura’s a different matter though!
204
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,480
Huh?!
205
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,480
Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...
206
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,250
Huh?!
207
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,580
...and Sakura is fighting.
208
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,750
What did you say?
209
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,990
Hey!
210
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,460
He’s late.
211
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,700
That Lee...
212
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,770
Something’s not right.
213
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,700
He’s always precise about time.
214
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,710
Perhaps he ran into the enemy...
215
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,610
Could it be...?
216
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,810
Huh, that wouldn’t have happened.
217
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,220
In any case, let’s find Lee!
218
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,450
Right!
219
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,830
Yes! I’ve finally mastered it!
Yes! Yes!
220
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,230
My friends, there’s no reason
to give up on your youth!
221
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,370
This Jutsu...
222
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,480
In the end, only Lee
could make it his own.
223
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,750
Yahoo!
224
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,310
– Hey Lee...
– I did it! I will do it!
225
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,980
– Lee! 					– When I try! I try!
226
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,980
Hey, Lee!
227
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,690
Hey!
228
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,660
Listen to this passionate message
from your teacher!
229
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh... what is it?!
230
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,470
Please tell me using hip words.
231
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,340
This Jutsu, the “Lotus”...
232
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,910
it will be dealt with henceforth
as a forbidden Jutsu.
233
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,640
– What?! 					– Huh?!
234
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,410
W-What do you mean?
235
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,650
This Jutsu poses a great burden
on the cells of the muscles,
236
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,020
it’s a kind of “Self-sacrificing Technique.”
237
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Humans normally utilize,
at most, 20 percent...
238
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,930
of the “power” that the muscles have.
239
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you understand?
Only 20 percent!
240
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,070
And if nearly 100 percent
of the “power” is used
241
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,570
the muscles themselves will disintegrate.
242
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,010
So, the brain usually controls the “power.”
243
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:21,240
However, this Jutsu forces the
brain’s limiter to go off by using Chakra,
244
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,650
allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...
245
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,190
In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu
which relies on a secret technique
246
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,860
that brings forth “power” almost
to the limit of one’s body.
247
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,930
So the only time it is all right
to use this Jutsu
248
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,060
is when a certain condition is met...
249
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,670
So... when is that?
250
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,900
Take this to heart...
251
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,360
The condition is
252
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,520
Guy Sensei...
253
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,330
I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.
254
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,290
Because this is the time you said...
255
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,630
"When protecting a previous person!"
256
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,550
He disappeared?!
257
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,990
Oh, oh no!
258
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,790
There's no way he can break his fall!
259
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,690
Take this!
260
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,530
Primary Lotus!
261
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,000
This feeling...
262
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,670
Well well...
263
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,550
Just in time.
264
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,530
T-That's impossible!
265
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,890
That is a frightening Jutsu...
266
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,600
It did this much even though
I fell on the spongy dirt.
267
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,400
It's now my turn.
268
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,540
Oh no!
269
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,870
With what I just did...
270
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,250
Lee!
271
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,420
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
272
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,150
But our Jutsu exceeds that
273
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,260
and is the speed of sound!
274
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,330
I'll show you there are walls
275
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,650
which effort alone can never break through.
276
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,190
Hey, can you hear it?
277
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:31,430
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
278
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,940
The ocean spans limitlessly
279
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:49,320
Please keep that smile on your face forever
280
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,230
Or else I’ll cry
281
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,030
You won't have to search around you
282
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,670
It’s all ok now.
283
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,640
Everyone is inside
this hand
284
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,080
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
285
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,650
When you forget what happiness is
286
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,460
Just sing.
287
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,700
Light is born, and darkness was born
288
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,030
The two are one
289
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,500
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
290
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,980
Hey, can you hear it?
291
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,140
I'm so frustrated!
292
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,870
I'm just pulling feet again.
293
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,850
I'm always just being protected.
294
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,890
I always just watch them from behind.
295
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,110
This time, I need to protect everyone!
296
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,640
Naruto, Sasuke, Lee!
297
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,320
I want to be like you too!
298
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,430
Next episode:
"Sakura Blossoms!"
299
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,630
Please watch my battle...
//%
1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,760
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,700
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,970
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,370
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,040
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,780
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,580
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,560
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,790
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,600
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,100
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,470
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,440
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,870
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,450
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,660
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,670
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,190
The Demon in the Snow
21
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,590
Gatô, why did you come here?
22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,960
And who are those henchmen?
23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,330
Our strategy has changed
a little…
24
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,570
I'm sorry about this Zabuza,
25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,610
but you will die here.
26
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,510
What?!
27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,150
Since hiring a regular Shinobi
costs a lot of money,
28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,580
I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.
29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,590
And, it would have been even
more ideal
30
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,290
to save my money and effort if
Ninja-to-Ninja battles
31
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,360
ended in each killing the other off.
32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,960
Well, you are certainly not worthy
of being called
33
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,460
the Demon of the
Hidden Mist Village.
34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,800
If you were to ask me,
you're just a cute little demon!
35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,940
What are those guys?
36
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,570
So many of them…
37
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,670
Kakashi…I apologize.
38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,040
Our fight ends here...
39
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,880
As long as my reason to
take down Tazuna is gone,
40
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,920
there is no reason to fight you either.
41
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,490
Yeah... you are right.
42
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,230
That reminds me...
43
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,960
I owe him something.
44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,600
He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...
45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,710
Huh, he's dead.
46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,510
You bastard!
47
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
What do you think you're doing, hey?!
48
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,350
Stop! Don't act so recklessly…!
49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,050
You say something, too!
He was your comrade, right?
50
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,560
Shut up, punk.
Haku is already dead.
51
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,360
What…?
52
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,590
Don't you feel anything watching
him doing that!
53
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,600
Weren't you with Haku for a long time!
54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,940
As Gatô used me…
I was simply using Haku.
55
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,010
I thought I'd told you…
56
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,410
We Shinobi are merely tools.
57
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,080
What I wanted were his skills
and not Haku himself.
58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,850
I have no regrets...
59
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,260
Do you...
Do you really mean that?
60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,890
Naruto, stop.
61
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,600
There's no need to fight
him anymore...  Besides...
62
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,670
Shut up!
My enemy is still... this one!
63
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,110
He...
64
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,350
He really liked you!
65
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,050
Is there someone special in your life?
66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,680
He liked you that much!
67
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,060
When a person feels he wants
to protect a person special to him,
68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,130
that person can truly become strong.
69
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,230
Even so,
don't you feel anything at all?!
70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,570
It's difficult for me to completely
become a Shinobi.
71
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,840
You really... honestly...
72
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,310
don't feel anything at all?
73
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,140
I'd like to make that person's
dream come true...
74
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,510
For that, I could completely
become a Shinobi.
75
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,050
When a person becomes
as strong as you...
76
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,590
Does that person really
behave like you?
77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,230
He threw his life away
for you!
78
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,600
I'd like to make that
person’s dream come true...
79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,630
That is my dream.
80
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,140
He didn't even fulfill his
own dreams and yet...
81
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,610
I was happy.
82
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,010
To die as a tool...!
83
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,580
That's...
That's... too painful...
84
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,930
Kid...
85
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,580
Don't say anything... anymore.
86
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,350
Haku was...
87
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,920
He wasn't just thinking of me.
88
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,590
He was feeling pain inside
for you
89
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,430
while he battled you guys too...
90
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,830
I know. 					He was too kind...
91
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,970
I'm glad we could fight with you
at the end.
92
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,010
Huh?
93
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,680
Yes, little punk,
it's as you say, after all...
94
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,890
Shinobi are human too...
95
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,690
Maybe it's impossible to become
an emotionless tool...
96
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,630
I've lost.
97
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,470
Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!
98
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,980
Okay...
99
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,590
What?!
100
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,190
Enough! Take them down!
101
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,590
Right!
102
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,090
Are you crazy?
103
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,500
Do you think you can win by yourself
against this many of us?
104
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,670
D-Demon!
105
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,190
If you're so anxious
to join your friend...
106
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,590
you go ahead... alone!
107
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,860
Unfortunately...
108
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,430
I don't... intend on going...
to the same place... as Haku!
109
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,300
W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...
110
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,410
You're going to hell with me!
111
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,580
It's no big deal...
112
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,680
When the Demon of
the Hidden Mists Village
113
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,790
dies and goes to hell,
he can become a real demon.
114
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,590
Look forward to it!
115
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,920
I'll let you find out
for sure
116
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,460
if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!
117
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,510
Haku...
118
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,460
Now... it's goodbye, Haku...
119
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,930
Thanks for everything...
120
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm sorry...
121
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,380
Don't look away.
122
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,780
It's the end for
a man who lived fiercely.
123
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,450
Yup...
124
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
Did I... die...?
125
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,330
Sasuke!
126
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,960
Sakura...
127
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,370
Am I... am I...?!
128
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,910
Sakura, you're heavy.
129
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,110
Huh?!
130
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,250
Sasuke...
131
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,060
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!
132
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,490
Sakura... 					That hurts...
133
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,290
Things turned out well,
didn't they, Sakura?
134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Stop, you shouldn't move...!
135
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,630
Anyway, where's Naruto?
136
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,200
And also,
what happened to that mask guy?
137
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,570
Naruto's fine.
138
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,880
And... the masked kid,
he died...
139
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,580
Died? Did Naruto get him?
140
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,590
Well... I'm not really sure,
but he protected Zabuza...
141
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,460
I had faith in you.
142
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,430
You are awesome, Sasuke!
143
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,600
You avoided getting inflicted with
any mortal wounds!
144
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,030
From the beginning... he intended to...
145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,440
Naruto!
146
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,600
Sakura...
147
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,570
Sasuke's all right!
He's alive!
148
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,210
Huh?
149
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,960
He was feeling pain inside
for you while he battled you guys too...
150
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,990
He was too kind...
151
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,430
I see... He...
152
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,430
So, Sasuke's all right too...
153
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,770
That's a relief...
154
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,040
Hey, hey, hey!
155
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,580
You guys are too relaxed!
156
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,250
Darn Ninja...!
Killing our source of money!
157
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,020
Now that it's come to this,
158
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,580
there's no choice but to attack
the whole town and
159
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,120
take everything valuable!
160
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,460
Shoot, this isn't good!
161
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,590
Kakashi Sensei!
162
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,590
Don't you have a Jutsu
to annihilate them all at once?
163
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,230
That's impossible!
I've used too much Chakra!
164
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,030
Here we go!
165
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,510
Enemies who come any closer
to the island...
166
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,280
With all the might of
all the island's people...
167
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,250
will not be allowed to live!
168
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,580
Yeah!
169
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,750
Inari!
170
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,460
Heroes always arrive
on the scene late!
171
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,590
Inari... You guys...
172
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,370
Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!
173
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,340
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
174
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,010
I can do that even
with my scarce Chakra...
175
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,580
At least, it will bluff...
176
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,920
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
177
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,220
Kakashi Version!
178
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,590
So... are you ready to fight?!
179
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,590
No, we're not!
180
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,440
We've done it!
181
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,490
Sounds like it’s over.
182
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,890
Yeah...
183
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,500
Kakashi...
I need to ask you a favor.
184
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,530
What is it?
185
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,570
His...
I want to see his face...
186
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,780
All right.
187
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,570
Huh?
188
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,940
Snow...
189
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,580
Snow at this time
of the year...?
190
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,590
Haku... 					Are you crying?
191
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Thanks, Kakashi...
192
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,550
You were always at my side...
193
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,380
At the very least...
194
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,420
I can be at your side in the end.
195
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,630
If it's possible...
196
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200
I'd like to go...
197
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,870
to the same place...
198
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,910
as you.
199
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,570
This guy...
200
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,140
He was born in a village
where it snowed a lot.
201
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,210
I see...
202
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,350
He was a boy as pure as snow...
203
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
You'd be able to go, Zabuza.
204
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,790
The two of you... together.
205
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,930
But you know, Kakashi Sensei...
206
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,530
Hmm?
207
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,630
I wonder if the way a Ninja
should be
208
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,570
is really as these
two were saying.
209
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,910
Shinobi should not seek
the reason for their own existence.
210
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,580
What's important is to
exist merely as tools.
211
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
That's the same in the Land of Leaves.
212
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,490
I wonder if that's what
it really means
213
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,590
to become a real Ninja.
214
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,590
I guess... I guess...!
215
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,430
I don't like that!
216
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,230
Do you think so, too?
217
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,900
Hmm...
218
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,870
Well... That's why all Ninja live
219
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,410
trying to figure that
out without realizing...
220
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,780
Like Zabuza... and that kid...
221
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,050
Okay!
222
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,190
Huh?
223
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,120
I've just decided!
224
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,490
I'm going to pursue my
own Way of Ninja!
225
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm gonna sprint straight
ahead and pursue
226
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,100
a way that I absolutely
won't regret!
227
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,150
Thanks to you the bridge
was safely completed,
228
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,080
but we will miss you very much.
229
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,590
Take care.
230
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,390
Thank you for everything.
231
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,990
Now, now!
232
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,130
We'll come back for
a visit again, Tazuna!
233
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,000
For sure...?
234
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,930
Huh?
235
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,510
Inari... you're gonna
miss us, aren't you?
236
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,210
It's all right to cry.
Go ahead and cry!
237
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,640
I won't cry!
238
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,250
It's all right if you cry,
Naruto!
239
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,780
Oh, is that so?
240
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,590
See ya!
241
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,590
Oh....!
242
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,600
You are so stubborn.
243
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,340
That boy changed Inari's mind...
244
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,540
and Inari changed the minds
of the village people.
245
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,140
That boy created a bridge
linking us to hope,
246
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,450
a bridge called courage.
247
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,050
So a linking bridge...
248
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,850
Speaking of bridges,
249
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,850
we need to name
this bridge, don't we?
250
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,490
That's true.
251
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,620
In that case,
252
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,490
I have a perfect name
for this bridge.
253
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,500
Yeah, what is it?
254
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,170
The Naruto Great Bridge?
How's that ?
255
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,670
That's a good name.
256
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,210
Okay! I'll get back soon
and have Iruka Sensei treat me
257
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,910
to ramen as
the mission completion celebration!
258
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,280
And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru
tales of my heroic exploits!
259
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,250
Then I...
260
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,350
Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go
on a date
261
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,550
when we get back to the village?
262
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,260
No, I don't think so.
263
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,920
Just like that...?!
264
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,630
You know! You know!
I'll go with you!
265
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Be quiet!
266
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,830
Shut up! Naruto!
267
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,570
What? Are you sure
that name's okay?
268
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,640
This name is to wish that
this bridge will never collapse...
269
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,480
And someday, it'll be the name
of a very famous bridge...
270
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,580
A name heard around the world.
271
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,190
That's truly what I hope.
272
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,600
Hey, hey!
273
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,470
Our Group Seven always
has the easy missions lately.
274
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Meanwhile, there are plenty of
powerful Ninja
275
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,640
like Zabuza and Haku in other lands.
276
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,970
Aren't there more exciting missions
where I can be more active?
277
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,580
Where I can use my Way of
the Ninja and my soul like…you know?
278
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,580
Next time:
"A New Chapter Begins:
The Chunin Exam!"
279
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
This is my Way of Ninja!
//%
1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,690
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,630
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,900
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,310
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,980
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,710
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,580
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,460
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,730
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,600
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,370
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,340
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,810
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,380
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,890
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,590
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,600
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,500
Naruto and others are
out there fighting!
21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,030
We should be too!
22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,470
The Weapon Known 					as Shinobi
23
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,740
Old man!
24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,040
Old Man Giichi!
25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,650
Please open up!
26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,750
Let's go to the bridge!
27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,580
If we all do it together,
28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,950
we can beat Gatô and
his men this time!
29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,590
Inari…
30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,130
I made up my mind not
to fight anymore.
31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,670
Even your father…
32
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,100
The man we called a hero…
33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,470
He's not with us anymore.
34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,080
If we were to fight,
many lives would be lost.
35
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,580
I don't want lose something that's
special to me anymore.
36
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,060
No one wants to regret again.
37
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,270
I…
38
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,800
I don't want to regret again, either.
39
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,870
That's why we must fight!
40
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,580
A man should live
his life without regrets.
41
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,120
I love Mommy and Grampa.
42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,350
And you too, Old Man Giichi!
43
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,420
I love all the people here!
44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,660
I finally realized…
45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,670
Nothing is accomplished if
I just cry all the time!
46
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,040
I finally got it!
47
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,090
Inari…has grown into
a fine man.
48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,630
Will you just let Inari go
there by himself?
49
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,040
Open up!
50
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,910
Hey!
51
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,580
I'm asking you to fight with me!
52
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,380
Old man! Please listen to me!
53
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,590
Why…
54
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,960
Why won't anyone open
the door to me?
55
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,930
You are strong!
56
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,040
Naruto…
57
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,490
Zabuza.
58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,590
You were too full of yourself.
59
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,600
You're too ambitious for your own good.
60
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,970
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.
61
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,970
You left the service with
few men under you,
62
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,040
and became a Rogue Ninja.
63
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,910
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.
64
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,950
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.
65
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,720
And you needed to hide
66
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,790
from the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.
67
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,390
Isn't that about the reason why
68
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,590
you hired yourself out
to scum like Gatô?
69
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,730
Zabuza…
70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,900
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just Sharingan?
71
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,570
Here's something I didn't copy,
a technique of my own…
72
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,580
to enlighten you!
73
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,260
Lightning Blade!
74
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,660
What the…?!
75
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,000
His hand is…
visibly overflowing with Chakra!
76
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,930
You are too dangerous.
77
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,570
Tazuna, the man you are trying
to assassinate,
78
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,170
is the symbol of courage
in this land!
79
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,580
The bridge he is building
is the hope of this land!
80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,180
And your ambitions will
sacrifice countless lives.
81
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,450
That isn't how
a Shinobi is supposed to behave.
82
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,190
Who cares?
83
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,590
I have always fought for
my own ideals.
84
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,160
And that will never ever change!
85
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,570
I'll say it again.
86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,570
Huh?
87
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,470
Give up.
88
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,580
Your future is…death!
89
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,590
Naruto…
90
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,590
I want you to kill me.
91
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,630
Please, make it quick.
92
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,870
What are you hesitating for?
93
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,380
I just don't get it!
94
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,480
The only reason you are allowed
to live is because you stay strong?
95
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,950
There must be something other
than just fighting…
96
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,290
There must be some other way
97
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,720
for you to make
the others accept you!
98
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,260
Remember when we met at the forest?
Do you know what I thought?
99
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,600
That you and I are much alike.
100
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm sure you can relate to me.
101
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,410
I apologize for dirtying
your hands with my blood.
102
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,610
Is that it?
103
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,910
Is there really no other way?
104
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,020
No.
105
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,090
If only…we had met under
different circumstances,
106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,990
we could've been friends.
107
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,670
Please…promise you will
grasp your dream.
108
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,740
He too…
109
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,240
Sasuke also had dreams of his own!
110
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,290
Thank you…
You will become stronger.
111
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,130
Hmm…
112
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,100
The super thick fog
has finally begun to clear.
113
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,930
There are two over there!
114
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,470
They are facing off each other.
115
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,330
Huh?
116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,470
I can't see well…
117
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,170
Which one is Kakashi Sensei…
118
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,580
One moved!
119
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,910
Huh?
120
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,060
Forgive me, Naruto…
121
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,500
I cannot die yet!
122
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,590
Is this the end…?
123
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,600
What was that?
124
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,030
Zabuza…
125
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,700
Did you say my future
was death?
126
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,610
You're off the mark again, Kakashi!
127
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,550
No…
128
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,080
You're not to go to the bridge alone!
129
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,620
I went all over the town,
but no one wants to come.
130
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,590
I have no choice!
131
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,590
But…
132
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,140
Wait! 					You're just a child!
133
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,580
I may be a child, but I already
know what it means to fight.
134
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,350
Because I'm my father's son!
135
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,260
My dear…
136
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,100
Wait a moment, Inari!
137
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,710
Where did he go…?
138
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,750
I didn't notice,
but the fog is starting to lift…
139
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,020
Huh? Is he over there?
140
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,920
Huh?!
141
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,470
What the heck is going on here?!
142
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,110
Isn't that the masked boy?
143
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,920
I didn't expect him to jump in
to save Zabuza…
144
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,730
The boy…is already dead.
145
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,600
You did great, Haku.
146
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,970
Kakashi Sensei!
147
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,580
He intends to slash me
along with the boy?!
148
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,410
That was really a great find I made!
149
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,580
Even in his final moment,
150
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,350
he gave me such
a perfect opportunity!
151
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,600
Haku, bad news.
152
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,900
I have to leave
Land of Water as of tonight.
153
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,940
However, I'll return
to this land someday.
154
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,880
I will rule over this land.
155
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,580
To do that,
156
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,150
what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.
157
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,720
What I really need is…
158
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,220
I already know.
159
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,690
You have nothing to fear.
160
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,390
I am your weapon, Zabuza.
161
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,830
Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.
162
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,430
You're a good boy!
163
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,390
Haku died and you were
able to move, huh?
164
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,420
I won't forgive you!
165
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,420
Naruto!
166
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,760
You just stay there and watch!
167
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,580
This is...
168
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,350
my battle!
169
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,490
Naruto…
170
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,330
Naruto!
lt's good to see you!
171
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,170
Sakura…
172
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,570
Where's Sasuke?
173
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,610
Naruto! 					Where is Sasuke?
174
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,520
Sakura…
175
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,090
Kakashi!
176
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,390
You have no time to take
your eyes off me!
177
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,600
Why don't I go with you?
178
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,030
That way, you won't be going
against your Sensei's word.
179
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,000
Right…
180
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,520
Sasuke…
181
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,560
Huh?!
182
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,890
He's cold.
183
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,390
This isn't Genjutsu, is it?
184
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,630
Don't mind me.
185
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,000
This isn't the time to
hold back your emotions…
186
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:54,020
I-I always got perfect scores
at the Ninja Academy…
187
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,590
Huh?
188
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,930
I memorized all the
hundreds of Shinobi rules.
189
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,600
All the tests were a breeze.
190
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,770
Until one day,
this question came up…
191
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,170
State Rule ♪ 25 of
the Ways of the Shinobi…
192
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,580
As always, I simply wrote down
the answer without batting an eye.
193
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,050
"A Shinobi must never
show his true feelings
194
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,920
under any circumstances,
no matter what…
195
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,890
The mission always comes first.
196
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,400
A Ninja must have the strength
of character never to shed any tears…"
197
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,610
Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?
198
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,480
That is so unbearably painful…
199
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,280
Sasuke…
200
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,580
Why…? 					Why can't I keep up?
201
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,020
Darn you!
202
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,370
Why you…!
203
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,020
You can't possibly defeat me
the way you are now.
204
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,590
What was that?
205
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,160
You still don't know…
What true strength means!
206
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,530
Let's see how things are going…
207
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,340
Goodbye, Demon!
208
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,570
Both your arms have
now been disabled.
209
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,570
You can't even weave a sign.
210
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,850
Huh?
211
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,220
Oh!
You really got it this time.
212
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,990
You disappoint me, Zabuza.
213
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,470
Huh?! You!
214
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,770
What the heck
are you doing?!
215
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,740
Don't you have anything
to say, Zabuza?!
216
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,540
He was your comrade, right?!
217
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,480
You were always,
always together, weren't you?
218
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,150
He really liked you, you know!
219
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,580
You really don't feel anything?!
220
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,550
Next Episode:
“The Demon in the Snow”
//%
1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,160
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,030
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,200
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,650
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,660
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,660
Now
12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,450
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,790
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,360
Sasuke!
20
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,230
Naruto’s certainly different
from you, Sasuke.
21
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,640
He’s a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
But he’s not in the least a coward!
23
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,210
Right? Isn’t that’s right?!
24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,310
Sasuke!
25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,030
You foolish little brother.
26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,800
If you want to kill me, resent me,
hate me and…
27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,630
continue to live your ugly life.
28
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,540
No...
29
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,810
Flee.
30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,410
Flee and hang on to your life.
31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,480
No!
32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,990
No!
33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,560
The Sharingan Revived:
Dragon-Flame Jutsu!
34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,330
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…
35
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,070
His blood has begun to stir...
36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,270
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.
37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,650
I have to live so I can kill
my older brother…
38
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,580
That’s what I thought.
39
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,790
But it’s me who was being stupid.
40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,250
Naruto!
41
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,990
Sakura!
42
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,820
How can someone who can’t put
his life on the line at a place like this...
43
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,930
beat that man?!
44
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,650
I can see.
45
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,640
I can see!
46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,610
I can see you!
47
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,660
It’s pretty good…
48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,970
You foretell my movements and
your aim is sure.
49
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,640
You can see my moves, can’t you?
50
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,320
The sun will set soon…
51
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,420
I must find him quickly!
52
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,760
It will become completely dark
and my disadvantage will increase.
53
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,100
But why in the world right now…
what’s his goal?
54
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,670
Well, that’s fine…
55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,840
He came to this village.
I’ll settle this here and now.
56
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,650
I got you!
57
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
A substitution!
58
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,940
Sasuke!
59
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,580
Humph! 					You are too easy.
60
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,210
The Uchiha name is crying.
61
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
That’s okay.
62
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,290
I’ll just take my time and play
with you before I’ll kill you.
63
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,360
Like a worm.
64
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,940
This is Sharingan Windmill Triple Attack!
65
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,750
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.
66
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,670
He did it!
67
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Sasuke!
68
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,690
You did it!
69
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,560
Are you okay?
70
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,500
Hang on.
71
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,080
Paralysis?
72
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,320
I didn’t expect that you could use
Sharingan this much at your age.
73
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,760
You are truly a member
of the Uchiha clan.
74
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,990
I do want you, after all.
75
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,670
You’re definitely his brother.
76
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,640
Your eyes hide more ability
than that Itachi.
77
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,910
Who in the world are you?
78
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,650
My name is Orochimaru…
79
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:05,660
If you think you want to meet me again,
desperately run to the top of this test.
80
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,190
– The Scroll!
– Defeat the three...
81
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,660
Sound Village Ninja
under my control.
82
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,530
You are not making sense at all!
83
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,640
We don’t want to see
your face ever again, got it?!
84
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,370
That won’t do.
85
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,510
Sasuke!
86
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,670
Sasuke!
87
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,000
You, what did you do to Sasuke?
88
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,910
I gave him a parting gift.
89
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,210
Sasuke absolutely would
come look for me…
90
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,450
looking for power.
91
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,420
I enjoyed seeing your various powers.
92
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,330
Sasuke!
93
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,630
Hold on, Sasuke.
94
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,100
C'mon!
95
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,850
Sasuke...
96
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,990
Sasuke, c’mon!
97
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,790
Sasuke...
98
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,460
Sasuke...
99
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
Naruto!
100
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,670
Sasuke’s... Sasuke’s...!
101
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,070
Naruto!
102
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,790
What?
103
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
What should I do?
104
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,450
I can feel it!
105
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,270
He’s close by.
106
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,990
It’s been a while...
107
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,960
Anko.
108
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,060
You’re level S class,
109
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,400
an extremely dangerous person on
the most wanted list.
110
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,640
That’s why I’ll kill you here
even if it costs my life.
111
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,310
That is my duty as
your former subordinate
112
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,580
who learned it all from you.
lsn’t that right, Orochimaru?!
113
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,910
No, you can’t.
114
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,730
Striking Shadow Snake!
115
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,640
I won’t let you escape.
116
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,300
I got you.
117
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,030
Orochimaru,
I’m gonna borrow your left hand.
118
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,070
This hand sign…
119
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,870
Right… you and I are going to die here.
120
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,280
Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice--
121
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,620
You intend to commit suicide?
122
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,460
Substitution.
123
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,090
As you are a Special Jonin
of the village,
124
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,290
you can’t be just using
the forbidden Jutsu I taught you.
125
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,660
I told you it wouldn’t work.
126
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,640
Why have you come now?
127
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,280
It’s our reunion after so long,
and you’re awfully cold.
128
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,950
Don’t tell me that you came
to assassinate Lord Hokage?
129
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,660
No, no…
130
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,660
I don’t have enough
subordinates for that yet…
131
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,460
I’ve heard of the excellence ones of
this village and thought I’d put dibs on it.
132
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,000
A little while ago,
133
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,640
I gave that same Curse Mark
as a present.
134
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,910
There’s a kid that I want.
135
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,210
Selfish as always.
136
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,020
That kid will die.
137
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,850
Certainly… the odds are 1 in 10
that he’ll die,
138
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,860
but he may survive just like you did.
139
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,560
This kid, you really like him, huh?
140
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,660
Are you jealous?.
141
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,970
Hey...
142
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,870
Are you still holding a grudge
that I used you and threw you away?
143
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,910
Unlike you, that kid will excel.
144
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,080
For one thing he inherited
the Uchiha ability.
145
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,490
He has beautiful features and is
a vessel who can become my heir.
146
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,720
If that kid lived,
it will make things interesting.
147
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,030
Be sure not to cancel this test.
148
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,170
Three people from my village
are also under your care.
149
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Make me enjoy it.
150
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,480
If something happens to
deprive me of my fun,
151
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,080
consider it the end of Leaf Village.
152
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,400
We’ve secured food and water after
spending half a day
153
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,770
and now most teams have halted activity.
154
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,770
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.
155
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,770
We'll split up into three and go scouting.
156
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,640
However, whether we find
other teams or not,
157
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,350
we return to this place.
158
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,280
Got it?
159
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,650
Okay.
160
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,780
Roger.
161
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,420
Okay.
162
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,490
Scatter!
163
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,100
His breathing is gradually
getting regular…
164
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,700
but he still has a terrible fever.
165
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,150
I have to protect them both.
166
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,970
I have to communicate this
to Lord Hokage right away.
167
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,570
Cripes! At a time like this!
168
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,570
T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.
169
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,500
So you are here, Anko.
170
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,320
You’re pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.
171
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,850
Well, don’t say that.
172
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,960
Are you okay, hey?
173
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,490
Huh? T-This is...!
174
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,100
The Curse Mark is appearing…
175
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,770
Don’t tell me…?!
176
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,670
Is it Orochimaru?
177
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,040
What, really?
178
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,410
Now that it’s come to this,
we’ll take you to Lord Hokage.
179
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,640
No, take me to the tower.
180
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,410
What are you saying?
181
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,780
The moment Orochimaru comes
to this village,
182
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,580
a strict alert is issued.
183
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,150
It’s more urgent than
continuing the Exam.
184
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,590
I know…
185
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,530
Anyway, I’ll tell the whole story later,
so please call for Lord Hokage.
186
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,040
I found you.
187
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,580
As Orochimaru ordered,
we’ll wait for daybreak to do it.
188
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,450
Sasuke Uchiha is our target,
not the other.
189
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,650
If they come in the way,
it’s okay to kill the other two, right?
190
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,690
Of course.
191
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,190
Hey, can you hear it?
192
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:31,430
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
193
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,940
The ocean spans limitlessly
194
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:49,320
Please keep that smile on your face forever
195
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,230
Or else I’ll cry
196
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,030
You won't have to search around you
197
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,670
It’s all ok now.
198
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,640
Everyone is inside
this hand
199
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,080
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
200
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,650
When you forget what happiness is
201
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,460
Just sing.
202
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,700
Light is born, and darkness was born
203
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,030
The two are one
204
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,500
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
205
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,980
Hey, can you hear it?
206
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,650
The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village,
Rock Lee, is here!
207
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,750
Yeah, I did it!
I did it, Guy Sensei!
208
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,120
Now I can get Sakura's heart,
right on the mark!
209
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,790
You could say, in terms of numbers,
the disadvantage is mine!
210
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,230
But on the contrary,
the conditions have been met.
211
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,530
Guy Sensei, I will use that technique
without hesitation.
212
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,770
Next episode: "Bushy-Brow's Pledge:
Undying Love and Protection!"
//%
1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,560
C'mon!
2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,560
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,830
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,240
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,910
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,650
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,520
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,390
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,660
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,530
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,930
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,300
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,270
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,740
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,310
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,820
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,530
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,530
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.
21
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,890
I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for
the first test of the Chunin Exam.
22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,530
You, from Hidden Sound Village!
23
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,270
No doing as you please
before the Exam!
24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,800
You want to be failed
at the get go?!
25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:13,480
Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams,
so we flipped out... despite ourselves.
26
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,020
Hmph. This is a good opportunity,
so I'll say this.
27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,690
There will be no battles,
competitions and the like
28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,390
without the permission
of the proctors!
29
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,890
And even if you get permission,
30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,290
actions that could lead to the death
of an opponent will not be permitted.
31
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,900
Any pig that screws with me
will be disqualified immediately.
32
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,970
Got it?!
33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,370
This Exam looks to be easy!
34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,180
Now then, we will start
the first test of the Chunin Exam!
35
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,380
Turn in your applications,
36
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,820
take one of these number cards
in exchange,
37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,220
and sit in the seat
matching that number!
38
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,820
After that, we will hand out
the paper for the written test!
39
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,730
Written...? Paper...?
40
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,860
Paper...
41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,570
A paper test?!
42
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,610
Start Your Engines:
The Chunin Exam Begins!
43
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,520
Everyone's seats are all scattered...
What should I do?
44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,030
He's deflated, deflated...
45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
It's the worst type of test for Naruto...
46
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,870
Naruto...
47
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,770
Oh! You are Hinata...!
Since when have you...?
48
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,210
L-Let's both do our best.
49
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,850
Y-Yeah.
50
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,120
I didn't notice her at all.
51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,520
Hinata has no presence at all...
52
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,830
There are several important
rules to this first test.
53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,600
I will take no questions,
so listen well accordingly!
54
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,270
Rules? No questions will be taken...?
55
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,740
First off is the first rule!
56
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,910
You are given ten points
each from the start!
57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,450
The written test has
ten problems in all!
58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,980
Each problem is one point.
59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,520
And, this test is a
point deduction system.
60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,020
You are deducted one point for
each problem you get wrong!
61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,990
If you get three wrong,
you'll have seven points!
62
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,190
If I get ten wrong,
I'll have zero points...
63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,330
The second rule.
64
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,530
Pass or failure will be determined
65
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,530
by the total points of
the three-person teams.
66
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,310
W-Wait a minute!
67
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,340
What do you mean...
total points of the teams?
68
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,510
Shut up!
69
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,510
There's a perfectly
good reason for this!
70
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,020
Shut up and listen!
71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Reason...?
72
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,150
If you've got it,
here is the most important next rule!
73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,620
Those who are deemed by
the sentinels
74
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,230
as having committed an act of
cheating or something similar to that...
75
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,600
will have two points deducted
for each act.
76
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,700
What...?
77
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,570
Oh!
78
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,240
In other words...
79
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,670
there may be those who will be
dismissed during this test
80
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,940
without waiting for test grading.
81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,680
This means they're deducting points
82
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,150
from things other
than the written test problems.
83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,150
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating...
84
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,690
will bring ruin upon yourselves.
85
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,690
I'll check you anytime.
86
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,560
If you aspire to become
a Chunin at all,
87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,530
know that Shinobi should act
like exemplary Shinobi.
88
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,640
Relax...! 					Yes... yes!
89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,510
Naruto aside,
Sasuke and I are okay!
90
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,510
Even if Naruto gets zero points...
if we cover that...
91
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,520
And, in the case of even one person
on the team getting zero points...
92
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,820
Everyone on that team will fail!
93
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,690
Wha--?!
94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,390
What did he say...?!
95
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,530
I feel two menacing stares...
96
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,660
Naruto?
97
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,030
By the way, the last problem will
be given forty-five minutes
98
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,500
after the start of the test!
99
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,240
The time for the test is one hour.
100
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,840
Begin!
101
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,050
Could it...
102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,490
Could it be that,
the fat is really on the fire now...?
103
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,590
Naruto...!
Just don't get zero points!
104
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,900
Naruto isn't getting jitters
from the get go, is he...?
105
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,870
This is bad...
106
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,540
As if!
107
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,610
I know I've cleared many obstacles
like this before...
108
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,010
At times like this, one should
look at all the problems
109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,510
without feeling pressed
or making a fuss!
110
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,350
And then with utmost effort
111
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,050
I should tackle the problems that look
easy to understand!
112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,420
Let's see, the first problem...
is a code text, eh...
113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,530
Excellent, I say!
114
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,960
Next! Next!
115
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,030
Let's see... the second problem...
116
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,740
The parabola B in the diagram illustrates
the greatest possible distance
117
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,510
Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shuriken
from a tree seven meters high...
118
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,510
Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja's
character inferred
119
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,980
from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,
120
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,850
also answer the longest firing range
in battle on flat ground
121
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,990
and explain your basis.
122
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,490
T-This is an... integrated problem based
on predictions
123
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,530
of uncertain conditions and
dynamic energy analysis application...!
124
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,030
There's no way
Naruto can solve this!
125
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,100
I mean...
126
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,470
hardly anyone except me
can solve this problem!
127
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,510
Okay, next! 					Next!
128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,150
These other problems...
are nothing but difficult ones.
129
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,590
I see...
130
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,860
I don't... understand even
one of these problems.
131
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,640
Oh, no, this is bad!
132
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,470
For real! For real!
133
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,570
What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?
134
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,290
If about ten of all fifty-one teams
are able to pass,
135
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,530
it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself and
get a considerable amount of points.
136
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,260
It's like a system inviting cheating...
137
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,530
I hope Sasuke and Naruto
won't panic and cheat.
138
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,970
It's okay...
Naruto's not that much of an idiot...
139
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,810
I know that...
140
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,440
Don't panic...
141
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,510
For now, all there is to do is to be
very, very cautious...
142
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,620
and cheat without being found out!
143
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,390
No! No! I can't, that's no good,
no good!
144
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,530
I can't tread on such thin ice!
145
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,530
At any rate, this elaborate fuss...
146
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,500
It's like a trick assuming
that we're going to cheat.
147
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,140
They probably check with that paper...
148
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,610
Somebody got nailed.
149
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,510
Cheating deducts two points.
150
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,380
Two-point deduction, huh...
151
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,520
Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment
the cheating was discovered...
152
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,600
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating
153
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,270
will bring ruin upon themselves.
154
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,510
Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
155
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,610
I see, so that's how it is, eh.
156
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,080
This wasn't just an achievement test!
157
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,950
The real aim was...
158
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,520
a test to see the ability
for intensive information collection
159
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,520
with the full use of deception
and concealment techniques.
160
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,360
"Shinobi should read
the double bluff," eh...
161
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
In other words, the true intention
of the proctor is...
162
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,530
if you're going to cheat,
not "awkward cheating,"
163
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,970
but "like exemplary Shinobi",
don't get caught.
164
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,310
Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness
of the point deduction system,
165
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,950
the lenience of only deducting two points
for each discovery of cheating makes sense.
166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,380
In other words,
167
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,520
what's being tested here is how
we can gather the correct answers
168
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,390
without having our cheating detected
by the proctors or
169
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,390
by the one being cheated on.
170
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,830
Realize it quick, Naruto!
171
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,200
It'll turn into a fatal mistake!
172
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,770
Realize it!
173
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,510
This is bad. Believe it...
174
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,880
If the purpose of this test is seeing
the ability to gather information...
175
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,850
then there should be someone
in this classroom somewhere...
176
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,590
who knows the answers
to the problems!
177
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,070
So Gaara has also started, eh...
178
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,600
Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow.
179
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,350
Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!
Next is problem four!
180
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,900
Judging from this rhythm...
181
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,770
The stroke order...
and the number of strokes...
182
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,240
I see.
183
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,290
Okay! Please tell me.
184
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,530
Eight, huh.
185
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,680
Lee, if you can see it,
wear your headband!
186
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,970
Time is rapidly going by!
187
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,440
Oh, man! I'm afraid all there
is to do is cheat...
188
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,940
But, if I'm discovered,
189
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,080
it'll be trouble for Sakura
and Sasuke.
190
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,350
On the other hand,
if I get zero points...
191
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,450
Sakura and Sasuke will be
my companions in failure.
192
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,450
Naruto...
193
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,090
I'll show you... my test.
194
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,230
Huh...?
195
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,260
What is Hinata saying...?
196
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,970
W-Why would she do
such a thing for me?
197
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,510
Could it be... some kind of trickery?
198
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,180
But Hinata is not one to do
something like that...
199
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,580
No... But she might've been coaxed into
attempting to trap me by Kiba and others...
200
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,950
Hinata, let me ask you one thing!
201
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,050
Huh?!
202
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,290
Why would you show me?
203
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,530
Uh... uh... actually...
204
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,500
I...I...
205
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,280
I don't want you, Naruto...
to leave at this stage...
206
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,550
Y-You see...
the nine of us are the only rookies...
207
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,520
and I have many anxieties about
what's to come, so!
208
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,530
I get it now! I was kind of
strangely suspicious of you!
209
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,140
Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!
210
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,270
Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...
211
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,450
W-What was that?
I was about to turn...
212
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,990
W-What was that for, sir?!
213
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,200
You made five mistakes. You fail!
214
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,230
N-No way...
215
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,740
His two buddies, both of you get out
of the classroom, right now.
216
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,520
♪ 23 fails!
217
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,990
♪ 43 and ♪27 fail!
218
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,520
Noooo!
219
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,260
Hey, hey! Do you have proof that
I cheated five whole times?!
220
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,600
Really, are you guys properly checking
this number of people...?
221
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,940
Listen up...
222
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,510
Even among us Chunin, we're elite
who were selected for this Exam.
223
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,510
We don't overlook you blinking once...
224
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,190
In a matter of speaking,
this strength is the proof.
225
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,060
Naruto...?
226
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,860
Hurry... Look...
227
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,180
Hinata... You don't get it, do you?
228
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,350
What...?
229
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,520
An awesome ninja like me
won't cheat. Believe it!
230
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,990
N-Naruto.
231
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,230
B-But...
232
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,300
Also, if something went wrong,
233
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,140
you'd be in a hot spot for
helping me cheat, right?!
234
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,270
\What?!
235
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,510
Naruto...
236
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,350
I'm... sorry...
I-I did something uncalled for...
237
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Nah, it's okay.
238
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,560
I...went and acted big.
239
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,160
What should I do?
I'm extremely stupid.
240
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,700
Byakugan!
241
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,740
Sharingan!
242
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,270
I'll copy all his movements!
243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,950
My hand is moving fluently...
244
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,310
I hit the jackpot straight away
with this guy.
245
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,150
Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh.
246
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,860
I'm acknowledging that your smarts
247
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,790
and the width of your forehead
are exceptional.
248
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,530
So you should thank me.
249
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,530
Thank me for getting to be
the target for this Jutsu.
250
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,600
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
251
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,710
So Ino... started using that Jutsu...
252
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,650
There's no countering that spell of Ino's...
253
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,820
Sakura, I let myself move
into your mind for just a little bit.
254
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,930
I have to memorize the answers quick.
255
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,760
I've got to pass these answers
to Shikamaru and Choji.
256
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,570
♪ 59! Fails!
257
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,140
♪ 33! ♪9!
258
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,470
This is the thirteenth group to fail.
259
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,780
♪ 41 fails.
260
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,950
♪ 35, ♪62 fails!
261
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,180
No way!
262
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,820
That brat...
263
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,520
He coolly proceeds through this
ruckus without moving an eyelash.
264
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,790
Very well done considering he's new.
265
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,580
The optic nerves are connected...
266
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,510
The third eye... open!
267
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,260
Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...
268
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,100
Dang it...!
269
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,020
Excuse me.
270
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,350
What is it?
271
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,520
I need to go to the bathroom...
272
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,160
We will accompany you
to the bathroom.
273
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,290
I see...
274
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,900
Anyhow... the proctors are
nothing so special!
275
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,040
They don't realize that the proctors
have increased by one...
276
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,510
Eh, don't you think so...
277
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,480
Crow...?
278
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,290
Forty minutes have passed
since the test started...
279
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,490
Twenty minutes left... huh...
280
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,220
Since it's come to this,
281
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,230
it's the last problem to be given
forty-five minutes after the start of the test.
282
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,330
All there is to do is bet on this.
Believe it!
283
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,530
Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for life
once I get it wrong?!
284
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,100
Really? Really? Really?
285
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,200
If I don't take it, I'll fail with
my comrades immediately?
286
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,800
No way, no way, no way.
287
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,870
The hopeless rule for problem ten!
288
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,540
Not good, not good, not good.
289
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,940
No way can I choose which one!
290
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,680
What to do, do, do, do.
291
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,350
This is seriously, seriously bad!
292
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,650
Bad, bad, bad, bad.
293
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,520
Next episode:
"The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!"
//%
1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,490
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,330
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,450
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,750
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,290
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,910
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,490
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,950
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,500
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,540
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,160
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,490
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,620
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,000
Laughing Shino
16
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,490
Shino! 					Let’s rest a little!
17
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,450
I’m tired from doing nothing but
walk since this morning, believe it!
18
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,950
You’re okay while
you can say you are tired.
19
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,490
It’s because you still have
energy left to talk.
20
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,080
Nothing but quibbling as usual…
21
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,540
Man, I’m unlucky.
22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,580
To be stuck on a mission alone
with Shino.
23
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,750
Hey, old lady.
24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,490
Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead?
25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,870
Are you going to Motoyoshi Village?
26
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:22,950
Yeah!
27
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,370
Then you’ll be right there
once you cross this path.
28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,580
Really? Thank goodness.
29
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,450
But exercise great caution…
30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,330
Huh?
31
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,000
Dead people also laugh
in Motoyoshi Village…
32
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,200
It will be all over if
you’re lured into laughing.
33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,830
Naruto.
34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,750
It’s Motoyoshi Village.
35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,080
We never imagined it at this time…
36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,490
To think that in this village…
37
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,750
an incident too terrifying to
even talk about would occur…
38
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,490
In Mourning
39
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,700
I’m Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner.
40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,200
I’m Shino Aburame.
41
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,450
I’m Naruto Uzumaki!
42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,410
Will
Getting right down to business…
43
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,000
This is the will of my father,
Tobei Kagetsu.
44
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,200
What’s this?!
45
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,540
My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu,
46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,200
shall inherit the entire
Kagetsu family estate…
47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,490
HOWEVER…
48
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,290
A funeral is to be held tomorrow
in Motoyoshi Village
49
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,120
for the head of the Kagetsu family
that owns that stretch of mountains.
50
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,450
I’d like you two to go.
51
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,490
Funeral security, huh?
Naruto can’t do it.
52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,490
What do you mean?!
53
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,040
It’s because you have
the most inappropriate face
54
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,700
in the Leaf Village.
55
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,200
Say what?!
56
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,490
I think so as well.
57
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,700
But there’s nobody else.
58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,080
So I reluctantly decided
to add Naruto.
59
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,490
You’ll be the main guy
on this mission, Shino.
60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,910
You're probably the best suited
for this mission.
61
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,830
Huh?
62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,790
As it happens,
63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,490
there’s one more important mission
in addition to security.
64
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,790
You’ll understand when
you see the will.
65
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,200
However, in the event that Futa raises
his voice in laughter at the funeral,
66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,000
he shall lose inheriting rights
and upon consultation,
67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,580
the estate shall be divided up between
the bereaved family members excluding Futa.
68
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,330
This will doesn’t make any sense at all…
69
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,120
An abundance of medicinal herbs
can be picked in the mountains
70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,660
owned by the Kagetsu family.
71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,120
I would have no trouble getting
by for the rest of my life
72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,200
if I were to inherit the estate.
73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,490
But all that will all go down the drain
just by laughing at the funeral!
74
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,450
There’s no doubt that the relatives
will be in a frenzy
75
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,910
trying to get me to laugh tomorrow.
76
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,250
To be honest,
77
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,160
I don’t have the confidence
to withstand it.
78
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,750
But there is one salvation!
79
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,250
According to the will,
80
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,500
it’s acceptable if I, the chief mourner,
were to appoint a substitute!
81
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,700
And so I commissioned the Leaf!
82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,490
I asked for someone who
absolutely will not laugh!
83
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,330
This is no doubt the perfect mission
for Shino.
84
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,910
I’ve never seen
this guy laugh before.
85
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,910
Indeed, I leave it to you.
86
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,700
I understand.
87
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,250
Big Brother, dinner’s ready.
88
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,040
This is my little sister Mai,
the youngest.
89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,490
She lived together with
my father in this large home.
90
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,700
She was also the one at his deathbed
during his final moments.
91
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,120
Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.
92
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,790
Nice to meet you…
93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,370
Let’s eat!
94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,450
Wait!
95
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,620
First, I’ll taste for poison.
96
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Taste for poison…?!
97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,080
I don’t think there would be anyone
among the relatives
98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,490
who would go that far…
99
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,370
But you can never be too careful.
100
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,290
You’ve got a point.
101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,540
Will you be all right, Shino?
102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,540
No problem.
Even if it did contain poison,
103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,370
the Parasitic Insects in
my body will dissolve it for me.
104
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,080
Parasitic…lnsects?
105
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,330
How is it?
106
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,490
It's all right…
107
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,500
Shino…laughed?!
108
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,120
He seems to be in very high spirits.
Which means the food is fine…
109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,490
Don’t eat!
110
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,370
Shino laughing like
this is definitely strange, believe it!
111
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,290
There’s a laughing drug in this food!
112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,250
Who cooked the food?
113
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,290
I did.
114
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,490
But the back door isn’t locked…
115
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,580
So anyone could get in if they wanted to.
116
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,370
To think there would be
someone in the family
117
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,120
who would go so far as to poison!
118
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,200
Oh, no…The drug has gotten to the insects!
119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,250
No good…
They can’t dissolve the drug.
120
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,580
Then what will we do about
the funeral tomorrow?!
121
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,580
This is a sight that doesn’t seem
of this world, believe it!
122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,580
Naruto!
123
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,540
Even if we were to
contact the village now,
124
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,490
we wouldn’t be in time…
for the funeral…
125
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,290
So Naruto!
126
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,500
You…
127
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,450
will have to participate in the funeral
as the chief mourner’s substitute!
128
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,490
No way…
129
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,080
Naruto.
130
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,660
I’m very uneasy, but I’ll be counting on you.
131
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,200
I’m also very uneasy, believe it…
132
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,080
Will you knock it off?! I can’t sleep!
133
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,750
You’re early, Tsukiko.
134
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,660
You’re already here, huh?
135
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,450
It’s dad’s funeral, after all.
I came here in great haste.
136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,870
Who’s that kid?
137
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,620
This is Naruto whom I’ve asked to
be my substitute as chief mourner
138
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
since I’m not feeling so well.
139
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,490
Nice to meet you!
140
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,490
That’s how it’s going to be,
so I will be leaving just with the greetings.
141
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,120
I see. But it sure is a troublesome will.
142
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,290
To think you can’t inherit the estate
if you laugh at the funeral…
143
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,700
Be careful.
144
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,490
She’s my immediate younger sister
in question, Tsukiko.
145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,450
Five years ago,
she married into the next village over…
146
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,830
But she’s probably the one
after this estate the most.
147
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,200
That kid will be a cinch.
148
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,830
Each and every one of them…
looks greedy…
149
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,500
What’s that…?
150
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,330
The monk has arrived.
151
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,950
Why choose a monk like this,
of all people?
152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,330
I have no knowledge of this!
153
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,830
It’s a different person from
the monk at the meeting.
154
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
Don’t laugh…
155
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,700
Don’t laugh…
156
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,660
Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
157
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,620
Now then, allow me to begin.
158
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,950
What was that sound?
159
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,290
Wasn’t it the wind blowing?
160
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,490
Naruto, did you not raise your voice
and laugh just now?
161
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,490
No, I didn’t!
I didn’t laugh at all, believe it!
162
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,330
Mai, you heard it, right?
163
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,490
I don’t know…
164
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,490
I only heard the sound of
barrels falling over.
165
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,490
Well, fine.
166
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,500
The funeral has only just begun.
167
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,040
There are still plenty of chances…
168
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,490
After all, the opponent is this kid
with a stupid look.
169
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,700
I’m saved…
170
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,040
Shino, huh? Thanks!
171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,490
That was a close shave…
172
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,490
In order, please.
173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,490
Then I’ll go first.
174
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,160
Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
175
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,490
No good… He won’t laugh at that...
176
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,830
I’ll give it one more push.
177
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,450
Don’t laugh…!
178
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,490
I must not laugh!
179
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,580
This kid is nothing.
180
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,080
I’ll kill him with laughter with
that technique of mine…
181
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,330
This guy also intends on
doing something, huh?
182
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,160
No matter what he does,
no way will I laugh!
183
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,410
Kiyoyasu!
184
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,620
–Kiyoyasu! 					–Kiyoyasu is…
185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,580
Here it comes…
186
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,490
Whatever he hits me with. I…!
187
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,250
I must not laugh!
188
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,950
Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
189
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,870
A flower came out…
190
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,620
Don’t laugh…!
191
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,750
Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
192
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,490
Don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh…
193
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,500
Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
194
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,370
I won’t laugh…no matter what!
195
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,870
He’s pretty tough…
196
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,870
But how long can he hold on for?
197
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,700
We’ll make him laugh by the time
the funeral ends without fail!
198
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,870
That…old woman…
199
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,120
Dead people also laugh
in Motoyoshi Village…
200
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,490
It will be all over if you’re lured
into laughing.
201
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,490
What’s she doing in a place like this?
202
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,490
Who’s there?!
203
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,200
Uh, oh!
204
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,450
Oh, it’s you Mai…
205
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,490
With this, it’s over!
We’ll put this in everyone’s tea!
206
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,750
But…
207
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,910
Everything will go well with this!
208
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,120
I don’t know about that.
209
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Who’re you?!
210
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,330
Shino…
211
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
I heard everything…
212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,490
How frustrating…
213
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,410
If this guy would just laugh,
I’d get some of the estate…
214
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,490
Thank you indeed for today.
Allow me to thank you all…
215
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,490
in place of the chief mourner.
216
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,490
With this, the mission is complete…
217
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,120
It looks like it will somehow
end all right.
218
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,290
Once the monk goes home,
the funeral will be over.
219
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,490
Please wait!
220
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,000
Please let my husband say
thank you as well. Okay, dear.
221
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,200
Hi! Thanks for coming today.
222
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,080
Huh?
223
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,000
Huh?
224
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,700
Wh-What’s he going to do?!
225
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,290
It was a very nice funeral.
I was so moved!
226
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,580
It’s tear-jerking.
227
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,830
That Tsukiko…
To think she would go this far.
228
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,450
Naruto, if you can get through this,
it will be over.
229
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,290
Please withstand it…!
230
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,750
It doesn’t hurt at all!
231
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,830
I must remember something sad
at a time like this!
232
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,490
Why do I think of the Pervy Sage
at a time like this?!
233
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,700
All right, now is the time
to finish him off.
234
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,490
This is awful!
The tears are causing my face to collapse.
235
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,660
What’re you talking about?
236
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,040
Your face…is right here!
237
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,830
N-No!
238
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,370
Oh, no…
239
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,620
Yes!
240
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,700
What?
241
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,490
D–Dad…
242
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,660
You’re alive? Dad?!
243
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,200
Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister!
244
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,490
Dad hates fighting!
245
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,660
I’ve thought up a good joke.
246
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,490
I’ve thought up a good joke, too.
247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,490
Who’re those kids…?
Where’d they come from?
248
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,120
I’d get dad to laugh, first!
249
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,500
I will be the first! You stay out of it!
250
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,120
Stop it! Fighting’s wrong!
251
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,000
It’s as Mai says.
Fighting’s wrong! Wrong.
252
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,540
Futa! Tsukiko!
253
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,490
–Futa?! 					–Tsukiko?!
254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,370
N-Now that you mention it…
255
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,950
Yeah…They are indeed us
from our childhood!
256
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,370
Oh, fighting’s wrong! A kettle’s a kettle!
257
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,790
My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins!
258
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,580
Groping is wrong!
Hot sake is where it’s at.
259
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,040
My wife’s secret stash is kept in a safe.
260
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,580
Between my legs…
261
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,000
Ding, dong, ding.
262
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,490
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
263
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
264
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,160
Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
265
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,250
Ding-dong.
266
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,000
–That’s right…
–Ding-dong. Ding-dong.
267
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,160
–When we were kids…
–Ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
268
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,160
–Dad made us laugh a lot
–Ding-dong-ding.
269
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,540
–with his silly jokes…
–Ding-dong.
270
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,910
–lt’s been a long time
–Ding. Ding.
271
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,080
–since I laughed at dad’s jokes…
–Dong-dong-dong. Dong
272
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,790
–Dong-dong
–This is it! This is what I wanted to see!
273
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,950
Dad!
274
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,370
Then who’s this?
275
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,490
The laughter stopped.
276
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,580
Shino!
277
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,490
I’m sorry, everyone!
278
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,200
But I didn’t think you’d all come
if it weren’t my funeral…
279
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,160
Mai helped me out a bunch
and this was the plan.
280
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,490
Is that really you, Dad? You’re alive.
281
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,750
Why’d you do this?!
282
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,540
In the old days,
before we knew that
283
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,160
the medicinal herbs we could pick
in the mountains would be profitable…
284
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,500
We were poor…
285
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,250
But we were bursting with laughter.
286
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,700
However, we got rich from selling
the medicinal herbs at a high price.
287
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,080
And when we’d open our mouths,
288
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,660
we’d start saying,
“Money! Money! Money!”
289
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,290
And the smiles vanished from
everyone’s faces.
290
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,540
I wanted everyone to remember
what’s important.
291
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,950
I wanted to get back
the family’s smiling faces!
292
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,790
If I wrote that ridiculous will,
293
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,540
everyone would do stupid things
trying to get Futa to laugh.
294
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,330
And then not only Futa,
but everyone would laugh and have fun…
295
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,490
Happiness isn’t money!
296
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,450
It’s living while getting along
with everyone and laughing!
297
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,830
I remember…
298
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,080
Sure enough, laughter is important.
299
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,490
That’s right…
300
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,250
To be honest, I’m sick of living
at the mercy of money.
301
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,540
You liar! You’re the one saying
money this and money that the most.
302
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,790
There are different kinds of “money,”
and what I was talking about was…
303
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,660
This bell.
304
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,000
Could that be…?
305
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,410
It’s the laughing drug.
306
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,370
It’s still at experimental stage, though.
307
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,490
If I made it okay to appoint
a substitute chief mourner,
308
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,830
Futa would summon someone
who definitely wouldn’t laugh.
309
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,120
So I tested it out on that person first.
310
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,080
I was going to make everyone laugh
by putting this in everyone’s tea
311
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,490
if nobody had laughed by
the end of the funeral.
312
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,750
But…
313
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,450
There’s no point to laughter
using a drug…
314
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,490
It’s because the people
wouldn’t be laughing
315
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,040
from the bottom of their hearts.
316
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,290
Instead, they’d be crying in their hearts…
317
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,490
Like me right now!
318
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,500
So at the end of the day,
what happened with the mission?
319
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,540
It's probably a success.
320
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,410
It’s because the Lady Hokage probably
knew about the real mission.
321
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,830
Say-say.
322
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,500
You transformed into that old man, right?
323
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,910
Then the “Between my legs,
ding-dong-ding” thing was something you…
324
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,490
Forget about that.
325
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,290
Absolutely forget about that.
326
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,410
O-Okay, got it.
327
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,290
Then, fine.
328
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,580
Sure enough, I…
329
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,540
I can’t get used to this guy…
330
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,160
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
331
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,750
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
332
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,490
Yellow Moon.
333
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:58,330
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
334
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,490
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
335
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:10,490
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
336
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,370
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
337
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:24,080
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
338
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:30,790
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
339
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,490
A magical chord change, in a restless city
340
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,490
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
341
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,330
The mission this time around is
a commission from the Land of Greens
342
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,540
and is protection for
some traveling merchants.
343
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,910
This is just a D-rank mission.
344
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,120
Don’t complain. The castle lord there
is a benefactor of mine.
345
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,250
Make sure you do nothing wrong.
346
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,490
I could manage a mission like
that asleep, believe it.
347
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,120
Very well.
348
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,620
However, I’ve got an important reminder
for you.
349
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,490
Reminder?
350
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,660
Make sure you don’t forget to take this
with you to the site.
351
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,490
That is all.
352
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,490
Next time:
“Open for Business!
The Leaf Moving Service.”
//%
1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,850
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,650
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,770
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,060
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,600
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,230
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,850
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,270
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,890
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,890
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,480
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,890
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,940
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:19,890
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
I’ll give it to you straight…
16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,890
Your next mission was commissioned
by a certain Feudal Lord’s daughter.
17
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
You are to act as her double.
18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,890
I don’t know where she heard about you,
19
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,900
but you apparently bear
a striking resemblance to the princess.
20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,480
Therefore she requested
that you be the one who carries it out…
21
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,890
A double…?
22
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,730
Is someone targeting the princess?
23
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,900
Well, if anything,
she’s the one who’s doing the targeting…
24
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,690
Huh?
25
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,150
Not to worry.
26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,890
You’re already an admirable
Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Furthermore, I’ve arranged for you
to have an assistant.
28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Assistant?
29
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,400
Grandma Tsunade!
You have a mission for me?
30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,900
And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!
31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,890
Huh?! 					Lady Tsunade!
32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,060
Sorry, but all the other guys
are too busy.
33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,940
Just me and this guy?
34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,650
Yup.
Do your best to carry out the mission.
35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,600
The client is
a Feudal Lord’s daughter, huh…
36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,770
Wow… I guess that means that
I’ve finally became good enough
37
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,890
to handle amazing missions
like this, huh?!
38
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,890
Hey, don’t get too excited.
39
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,350
Terrible things happen
when you're like that.
40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,690
I know…
Just leave things in my capable hands!
41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,770
You’re really a piece of work…
42
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,730
Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!
43
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,980
Thank you for coming from afar.
44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,770
That’s the client?
45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,520
She and Ino really do look alike, but…
46
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,900
I-It’s a bit of a stretch…
47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,230
It’s all right.
I have an idea of what you wish to say.
48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,770
My physique doesn’t really resemble
that of the double there…
49
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,560
That’s what you’re thinking, right?
50
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,270
– Oh…not at all… Umm…
– To be honest,
51
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,520
– I don’t think you resemble her at all.
– Hey!
52
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,230
Well, I don’t blame you for thinking that.
But here, have a look at this!
53
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,850
T-That’s…lno!
54
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,890
That’s what I looked like
a short time ago…
55
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,770
Truth be told, I only got like this
56
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,890
after it was decided that
I was to have an arranged courtship.
57
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
An arranged courtship?!
58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,230
The other party is Master Chikara
from the neighboring Land of Udon.
59
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,060
Ever since I saw his picture,
60
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,270
my feelings for him
have deepened day by day.
61
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,520
And as the day
of the arranged courtship grows closer,
62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,890
I have become increasingly nervous,
my cheeks have been flushed,
63
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,890
and my heart has been pounding.
64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,730
I can’t even sleep at night.
65
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,150
And because of that stress,
I’ve started overeating…
66
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,520
It goes without saying that
you’ll get fat if you pig out.
67
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,850
Of course,
I’ve taken appropriate countermeasures!
68
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,890
I’ve been using something that cuts all
the fats and carbohydrates that I ingest…
69
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,150
"Easy-Peasy Slim Special”
70
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,980
It didn’t work, did it?
71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,020
I placed too strong hopes in it…
72
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,230
How can I possibly have
an arranged courtship
73
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,730
with the man I’m infatuated with
when I look like this?
74
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,890
So that’s my situation…
Now, let’s get to the main issue.
75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,270
I want you to attend
the arranged courtship in my place
76
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,520
and make it a success at any cost.
77
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,020
Huh?! 					So this double thing
78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,980
is just to act on you behalf
at some arranged courtship?!
79
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,310
What do you mean by
“some arranged courtship”?!
80
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,890
I mean, when you talk about doubles,
you thinks of situations
81
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,980
where someone’s life is in danger
and that sort of thing.
82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,600
What are you talking about?!
83
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,150
The princess’s entire life is at stake!
This is major!
84
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,900
Oh! So you understand a heart in love…
85
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,890
I sure do…
A girl always wants to look cute
86
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,650
for the guy she loves.
87
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,020
Even if she’s a fake…?
88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,890
It can’t be helped.
I mean, guys prefer slender girls.
89
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,890
That’s exactly right!
90
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,650
I’m counting on you.
91
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,270
Sure thing! Leave it to me!
92
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,690
But even if
the arranged courtship goes well…
93
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,940
The gap is just too big.
94
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,600
I’ll just have to lose weight
by the day of the wedding.
95
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,060
I already have a plan in place for that.
96
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,100
This supplemental type diet food,
“Supplement Slender”!
97
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,560
If I supplement all three meals with this…
98
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,520
Why don’t you draw on the lessons
you’re supposed to have learned…?
99
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,890
In any case, I’ll use my charms to make
this arranged courtship a success!
100
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,890
This annex is where
I often played in my childhood.
101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,190
I plan to use this to listen in on
the arranged courtship from here.
102
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,810
Huh… That’s pretty convenient.
103
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,940
I would love to meet him in person
if I could, but…
104
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,890
Hey, is he that cool looking?
105
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,850
Of course he is!
106
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,310
He’s someone with
something really special about him!
107
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,850
Well then,
just make sure he falls for you.
108
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,520
Leave it to me!
109
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,890
I thought you weren’t motivated…
110
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,150
Well, this is a mission after all.
111
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,890
So I think I’ll pull myself together
and hustle!
112
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,190
Don’t do anything unnecessary, okay!
113
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,100
W-What’s up?
114
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,850
The sound is getting closer!
115
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,890
– What? 					– It’s so bright!
116
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,060
There are many a handsome man
in this world,
117
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,270
but this man is
renowned even among them!
118
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,900
This man makes
Land of Udon what it is…
119
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,350
that sexy man
with glistening sidelong glances!
120
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,890
The oh-so-great young prince Chikara…
121
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,650
Kneel down and bow before him!
122
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
Sorry.
123
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,560
It appears that
I have kept you waiting, princess
124
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,890
You're…Master Chikara?
125
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,940
He’s even more intense than
lntense-Brow Sensei.
126
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,770
I’m sorry, pretty girl.
127
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,890
I have constitutional low blood pressure.
128
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,690
Dunno. He looks more like
he has high blood pressure to me…
129
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,520
What?
130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,520
D-Do you always scatter
flower petals?
131
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,230
Flowers are wonderful.
132
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,350
They truly allay the fatigue
of your mind and your body.
133
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,020
Don’t you find them relaxing?
134
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,270
I-I guess…
135
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,980
Okay then, next…
136
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,890
Hey, don’t you think
he’s different from her description…?
137
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,890
I mean, he’s fa…
138
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Fa…?!
139
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,350
Stop!
140
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,890
These sweets are really fabulous,
aren't they?
141
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,020
Do excuse us a little.
142
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,890
What the heck are you doing,
out of the blue like that?!
143
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,400
It’s women’s intuition.
144
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,600
I got the same vibe from him as Choji.
145
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,270
That word is probably taboo.
146
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Oh, I see!
147
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,520
Gimme a break!
148
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,600
What’s up with that uselessly
intense chubby guy showing up
149
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,890
when she told us
he’d be a handsome prince?!
150
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,890
But wouldn’t his physique
be a perfect match for her?
151
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,890
I’m sure there must be some mistake.
152
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,730
There’s no way a girl
would fall in love with a guy like that.
153
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,690
But maybe that’s
the princess’ taste in men…
154
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,730
That’s impossible. I mean…
155
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,770
He’s flashy…!
156
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,810
Intense…!
157
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,850
And a fatso!
158
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,730
He’s a freak! A freak!
159
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,020
There’s gotta be a mistake!
I’m sure of it!
160
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,890
Y-You think so?
161
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,770
What are you saying?
162
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,190
There’s no mistake that that’s
Master Chikara, the man of my heart.
163
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,890
I thought so…
164
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,940
What an elegant man…
165
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,890
I deeply regret that I cannot see him
up close with my very own eyes.
166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,650
I guess one could say that everybody
has their own set of woes.
167
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,730
Listen, make sure that
he takes a liking to me no matter what!
168
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,650
Stop complaining and get the ball rolling
with dogged persistence!
169
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,190
I will convey that to her.
170
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,890
Has you tension not eased?
Music is good for relaxation.
171
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,270
Please, you need not go to the trouble…
172
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,890
– What did she say?
– She said there’s no mistake.
173
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,440
She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!
174
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,190
I can’t believe it!
175
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,940
It’s our mission, you know!
176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,310
I know that…
177
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,890
Princess Fuku…do you like roses?
178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,270
Yes…very much so…
179
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,150
Great! 					I love roses too!
180
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,310
In the language of flowers,
they signify love!
181
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,690
But don't their meanings
differ depending on their color?
182
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,890
For example, yellow roses are
supposed to mean “Let’s break up”…
183
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,020
It’s nonsense to discriminate
because of color…
184
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,230
I mean the flowers
are not at fault, after all.
185
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,940
For you.
186
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,890
Hey…wait!
187
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,650
Huh?
188
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,190
I can’t do it! I can’t do it!
189
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,230
There’s no way!
He’s too intense.
190
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,890
There’s no way I can act as
a substitute for the princess!
191
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,150
Calm down.
Stop saying that and do your best.
192
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,940
Nope.
I just can’t stand him physically.
193
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,890
Oh, I got it.
194
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
If you just think of him
195
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,890
– as a somewhat intense Choji…
– Choji has fat on him
196
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,690
for the sake of his Ninjutsu…
197
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,890
I don’t have the slightest idea
what purpose that prince’s fat serves.
198
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,890
That’s a pretty severe opinion,
you know…
199
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,900
I’m going off somewhere for a moment.
200
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,730
Huh? Hey, where are you going?!
201
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,690
Gimme a break, that girl’s a handful…
202
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,350
Well, this is for the sake of
a mission after all.
203
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,730
I guess it’s about time for Naruto
to lend a helping hand!
204
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,980
What is it?!
205
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,100
I’m not judging you, but I think you
should pass on that young prince.
206
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,890
There’s something wrong with his head.
I’m positive!
207
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,890
What are you saying?
He’s a passionate and wonderful man!
208
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,940
But…
209
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,940
I hired the Leaf to
provide me with substitute for
210
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,310
the arranged courtship
and bring it to success.
211
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,730
You’re a professional Shinobi, right?
212
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,310
So I suggest you get on it
and get the job done!
213
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,900
The atmosphere in there
hasn’t been very congenial at all!
214
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,100
You need to be aggressive
in making yourself appealing to him!
215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,310
I’m sorry to have
kept you waiting, Chikara!
216
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,600
That’s right!
Just like that…huh?
217
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,890
That jerk…!
218
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
H-Hey!
219
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,270
P-P-Princess?
220
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,100
Master Chikara… Could you loosen
my sash for me, please?
221
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,190
But…but…
222
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,890
Please.
223
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,190
Oh my gosh!
224
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,650
There’s a creepy-crawler up here
under the roof that looks like a sow bug!
225
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,520
Mind Destruction Jutsu!
226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,400
A creepy-crawler
that looks like a sow bug?
227
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,890
An insect?
228
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,560
Oh…she vanished…
229
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,270
What the heck are you thinking?!
230
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,350
Where is the princess?
231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I don’t know.
232
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,890
She vanished…
233
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,890
What is going on anyway?
234
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,810
This is starting to irritate me…
I can’t get what’s happening from here.
235
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,810
Why are you meddling!
I was just one step away!
236
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,890
What do you think you’re doing,
dressed up like Princess Fuku?!
237
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,270
I’m telling you!
238
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,100
In one of Pervy Sage’s books
happened to glance at,
239
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,310
this is the kind of thing that worked.
240
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,560
I don’t believe that anyone would
use such a garish advance!
241
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
That’s dirty!
242
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,400
There’s absolutely no way
a type of guy like you
243
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,520
would ever be mistaken for
the protagonist of a boy’s comic!
244
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,940
Huh! I was doing a way better job
than you were!
245
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Gimme a break…
246
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,850
Now that things have come to this,
247
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,890
I need to take care of business
before another meddler gets in the way!
248
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,690
Huh… You gotta be kidding…
249
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,150
It looks like my help is needed
if this mission is going to be a success.
250
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,850
Princess…
where in the world have you been?
251
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,270
Please forgive me. I was so nervous
I just flew into a panic earlier on…
252
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,350
You really seemed like
a totally different person.
253
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,230
I’m so sorry.
254
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,890
You were such a wonderful person,
that it became almost unbearable…
255
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,810
Non. That is bad.
256
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,940
We must change
the air in here then.
257
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,560
Oh, in that case, I will…
258
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,730
Hi… Chikara!
259
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,020
Huh?
260
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,890
That just now,
outside the sliding paper door…
261
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,560
What’s the matter?
262
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,520
There was one more…princess!
263
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,100
That can’t be… Impossible.
264
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,940
INNER INO 							Naruto…!
265
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,060
But I’m very moved that
you have such deep feelings for me
266
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,600
that you actually saw a vision…
267
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,480
Vision? No, I definitely saw…
268
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,890
You mustn’t look!
269
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,560
P-Princess?
270
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,890
Damn…I did that without thinking…
271
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,730
Oh goodness me…
272
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,890
In my ardent desire for
you to look just at me, I…
273
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,890
What intense passion…
274
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,230
All right…
As you wish, princess.
275
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,650
– Huh? 					– Allow me to catch
276
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,480
those hot feelings in fine style!
277
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,190
Could this be…?
278
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,890
Come, don’t hold back.
279
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,980
Huh?!
280
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,890
You may not kiss him!
No kisses!
281
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,890
Oh!
282
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,980
Goodness, you cannot
be too careful these days!
283
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,900
Who told you that you could
go as far as kissing him?!
284
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,100
Oh, it’s not that I wanted to…
285
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,020
I’d have to say that
you actually came to my rescue.
286
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,890
Don’t bandy words with me!
287
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,940
Listen carefully, holding hands is
as much as I can concede to you…!
288
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,650
You’re too loud!
289
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,890
The princess vanished again.
290
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,350
– Princess! 					– Princess!
291
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,980
This isn’t good!
I better hurry back.
292
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,400
Don’t try anything funny in there!
293
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,850
I know that! In any case, we can’t let him
see the two of us together!
294
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,890
Hurry back to your room, Princess!
295
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,100
All right.
296
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,650
Gimme a break that Ino…
297
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,020
Dumping me in the lake like that.
Thanks to her I’m freezing!
298
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,190
This is bad! I gotta pee…
Gotta go!
299
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,270
I don’t know where
the toilet is around here.
300
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,900
There’s nobody around…
Well, it is an emergency situation after all.
301
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
Huh?!
302
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,810
W-W-What the heck do you think
you’re doing over there looking like me?!
303
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,350
No…this is…um…
304
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,980
How shameless!
Stop that immediately!
305
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I can’t stop it…
306
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,890
Do you not understand that
I’m telling you to stop!
307
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,810
It’s impossible to stop so sudden!
308
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Hey!
309
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,310
Wait up!
310
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,150
I wasn’t quite
emotionally prepared earlier on…
311
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,060
However, the feelings I have
for you in my heart are true.
312
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Princess…
313
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,810
Master Chikara…
314
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,520
I have harbored a secret love for you
for a long time.
315
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,890
Please, take me…
316
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,890
Huh?
317
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,600
– I wonder what that sound is?
– I have no idea…
318
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,890
Rain?
319
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,770
What a beautiful rainbow…
320
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,890
Stop, I say!
321
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,400
I told you, it’s impossible!
322
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,230
Ouch!
323
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,890
Princess?!
324
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,520
Naruto!
325
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,810
You idiot!
326
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,600
Forgive me for this one, please!
327
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,100
I won’t forgive you!
328
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,150
Look what you’ve done!
329
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,190
Ouch… Stop!
330
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,060
What in the world is going on?!
331
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,440
Oh no!… 					Umm…this is, well…
332
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,020
All right, that’s enough…
We can't fake it any longer.
333
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:27,230
I apologize for having hoodwinked you.
I am…the bona fide Fuku.
334
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,810
You mean to say that
the princess up to now was an imposter?
335
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,730
That is correct.
336
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,020
What is the meaning of all this?
337
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,480
I wouldn’t have imagined that
things would come to such a finale!
338
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,480
No, that’s not correct, Master Chikara!
339
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,890
Out of my way!
340
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,850
The super body I fantasized about
in my dreams! My ideal personified!
341
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,020
Bravo!
342
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
– Huh? 					– Huh?
343
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,890
My cute princess. Please marry me!
344
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,400
I’m delighted, Master Chikara!
345
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,190
Hail the future wife!
346
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,560
What is this anyway…?
347
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,520
Somehow it seems like our mission
turned out to be success in the end…
348
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,890
I think?
349
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,890
Could it be? I put all my efforts
in making advances on a guy
350
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,650
who’s not my type in the least
and got rejected.
351
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,890
Moreover,
it was a totally wasted effort…
352
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,890
Is that what happened?
353
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,150
But, everything turned out well.
So isn’t it okay?
354
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,350
And both of them look so happy together…
355
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,980
That’s not the problem!
A damsel’s heart has been wounded…
356
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,890
I can’t believe that, of all things,
I was brushed off by a guy like that…
357
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,890
He didn’t even glance in your direction
at the end there.
358
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,230
Stop it! Don’t remind me.
359
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,810
You can never knows
what a person likes, can you?
360
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,350
Nope…
there’s no way I’ll acknowledge that!
361
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,690
A man’s got to like a slender girl better!
362
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,060
In order to become
even more of a woman,
363
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I’m going on a diet! On a diet!
364
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,060
Wait…wait up!
365
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,940
On a checkerboard night
366
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,560
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
367
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,940
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
368
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,100
Suggestively
369
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,890
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
370
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,690
The Trombone gradually going off-key
371
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,810
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
372
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,190
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
373
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,400
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
374
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,520
Naruto, let’s make some
bittersweet memories of youth together!
375
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
– Huh? 					– No need to be shy.
376
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,310
I am ready both in mind and body!
377
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,890
What are you blabbing about
all of a sudden?!
378
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
It was long…
379
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,350
To think how much
I’ve waited for this moment!
380
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,810
I have no idea what you’re talking about!
381
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,890
Here I come Naruto!
Please become my first.
382
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,890
Just a minute.
383
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,100
Next Time: “Viva Dojo Challenge!
Youth is all about Passion!”
//%
1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,450
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,250
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,370
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,660
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,200
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,830
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,450
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,870
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,490
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,490
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,080
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,490
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,540
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,000
Naruto!
16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,830
There was an emergency transmission
from the training room!
17
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,790
What in the world happened?!
18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,540
Actually, the star was stolen.
19
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,370
The enemy is a Ninja
who flies using Chakra!
20
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,370
No way…!
21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,290
I’ve never heard of
a flying Shinobi.
22
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,580
Byakugan!
23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,080
I lost him…
24
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,370
But what Naruto said is true.
25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,500
To think he can fly
using Chakra…
26
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,490
That’s an incredible Shinobi.
27
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,580
So it was true.
28
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,830
What?! You didn’t believe
what I said?!
29
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,700
You could say that.
30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
Wh-What’s up with that?
31
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,120
Do I have that little credibility?!
32
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,200
The Remembered Lullaby
33
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,540
So the star of
the Village Hidden in Stars
34
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,490
is a meteorite, huh?
35
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes…
36
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,950
The First Hoshikage…
37
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,490
That’s what they call
the village leader.
38
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,660
He discovered that if
you train by the “star…”
39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,750
Chakra is strengthened.
40
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,290
Ever since then…
41
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,410
the Hidden Star has been
in a unique position
42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,250
even among the Ninja hidden villages.
43
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,830
But it says in these documents
44
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,490
that the training hasn't been conducted
these past ten years…
45
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,250
The leader who called himself
the Third Hoshikage
46
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,830
prohibited the training…
47
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,950
But about a year ago…
48
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,490
It seems they started again
after that Hoshikage died…
49
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,490
But why? Why do something
like prohibit training…?
50
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,660
Who knows…?
51
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,080
It’s a classified matter of
the Village Hidden in the Stars, so…
52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,290
But there were various rumors
circulating around about it…
53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,490
Rumors?
54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,290
Yeah… Rumors about most
of the Ninjas who trained dying…
55
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,750
Chakra is forcibly strengthened
by the power of the unknown star.
56
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,870
There may have been
adverse effects on the body.
57
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,490
What…?
58
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,870
The star was stolen?!
59
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,950
Yes! The people who were
training were at the scene,
60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,160
but they were all knocked out
by an enemy Jutsu…
61
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,490
Pathetic!
62
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,490
You say that,
but that Ninja had incredible Chakra!
63
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,250
Naruto, is it that incredible?
64
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,370
Yeah! Turning Chakra
into monsters or wings.
65
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,370
It’s the first time I ever saw that!
66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,120
Is that true…Sumaru?
67
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,200
Yes!
68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,750
It’s the Ninja Art: Kujaku,
no mistake!
69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,080
That’s the Jutsu passed on
in the Village Hidden in the Stars, huh?
70
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,250
Yeah… As for that Jutsu, only those
who have mastered the star training can…
71
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,120
Sumaru!
72
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,200
Tenten…
73
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,370
The secrets of a Jutsu are not to
be spoken of or asked about lightly.
74
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,490
Especially with a Jutsu that can only
be passed on to those of that village…
75
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
I’m sorry…
76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,410
Lord Akahoshi,
please give me an order!
77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,620
The star being stolen
is my responsibility.
78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,750
No…
79
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,080
The star was stolen
80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,490
even though we were commissioned
a mission to protect it.
81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,330
It’s also our responsibility.
82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,490
We will get the star back by
our own hands, no matter what!
83
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Yes… I will leave the search for
the star to the Leaf Shinobi…
84
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,620
Sumaru, you keep an eye
on your injured comrades.
85
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,490
But only those in the village
know village matters…!
86
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,490
It’s an order!
87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Hey! Are your friends who got beaten up
by the enemy Ninja okay?
88
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,910
That’s none of your business!
89
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:29,870
What…?!
90
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,750
At the end of the day,
you’re still Ninja from some other village!
91
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,000
You’re not my friends or anything!
92
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,250
What’s with him?!
93
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,040
Neji, you’re talking about
taking responsibility,
94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,500
but we haven’t even seen
the scene of the theft.
95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,490
That’s right…
And we don’t have any leads.
96
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,490
No, we do.
97
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,490
You didn’t pick up on it?
98
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,790
Akahoshi the village leader
knows something!
99
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,040
What do you mean by
knowing something?
100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,370
Come to think of it,
101
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,250
when Sumaru was talking about
the Kujaku something or other,
102
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,490
his expression changed.
103
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,490
Then that means the culprit is
someone associated with this village?
104
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,580
So, like I said, what does this mean?!
105
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,790
I’ll make a go around the village
106
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,790
and look for something that
could make for a lead.
107
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,580
Lee and Tenten, you keep watch over
that village leader called Akahoshi.
108
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,080
I understand!
109
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,370
Leave it to us!
110
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,000
I don’t get it!
What the heck should I do?!
111
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,200
Let me see…
You investigate from Sumaru’s angle.
112
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,540
All right! Leave Sumaru to me.
113
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,490
Then, I’m off for a run!
114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,490
Same as always…
115
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,450
Naruto sure is
an impetuous person, isn’t he?
116
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,080
♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
117
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,620
Because I had a sad dream last night.
118
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,250
My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
119
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,080
Swollen as I cried…
120
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,490
Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
121
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,330
I'm searching for a child
who has gone afar
122
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:42,490
My sad dreams come once more. ♪
123
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,540
Hey Sumaru!
124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,490
What’re you doing?!
125
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,120
Nothing! I was just looking
at the stars!
126
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,490
Stars?
127
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,250
Come to think of it,
you can see the stars well in this village.
128
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,450
That red star’s sure pretty…
129
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,870
Natsuhiboshi…
130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,580
It watches over me all the time…
131
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,870
Huh?
132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,490
H-Hey… Hold it. I want to go
visit your friends.
133
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,830
Look, here…
134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,830
I’ve brought the Hidden Leaf specialty
Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly!
135
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,540
Go if you like!
lt’s right near the training room!
136
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,500
Huh?
137
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,950
A cold-hearted guy as usual…
138
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,500
What? Is nobody here?
139
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,700
Sorry to bother you.
140
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,330
Where is everyone?
141
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,290
Oh, is somebody sleeping?
142
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,450
Stop it… Hokuto.
143
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,870
I can tell… He’s not an enemy.
144
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,490
Mizura…!
145
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,620
You little!
145.01	01:35:28:21	01:35:32:04	Oh, ouch…
146
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,700
A girl…?
147
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,490
Who are you?
148
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,540
I’m a Ninja from the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, Naruto Uzumaki!
149
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,700
I came to this village
to protect the star !
150
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,040
Y-You are…?
151
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,450
I’m sorry for my rough behavior!
152
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,450
It’s cool. I just came to visit…
153
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,120
Where’s the Roasted
Chestnut Bean Jelly…?
154
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,370
Oh! That’s it!
155
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,500
Oh, no!
156
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,830
There’s no mistake…
157
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,120
Then it was that person who
made off with the star, after all…
158
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,490
So you’re saying that one’s still alive…?
159
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,750
Then this will be difficult.
160
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,490
That one being the final Ninja
completely trained
161
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,160
in the power of the star means…
162
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,160
Not an opponent we can handle
with the likes of our Jutsu!
163
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,490
Don’t get flustered…
164
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,200
If the culprit is who we think it is,
165
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,330
we already hold that one’s weakness
in our hands.
166
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,490
I get it…
167
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,490
Then let’s grab that person up.
168
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,490
Wait…
169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,830
First we must avert the eyes
of the annoying flies!
170
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,490
I’m sorry…
My name is Hokuto…
171
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,580
I felt Chakra from someone not
of this village…
172
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,410
I carelessly…
173
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,580
Well, the flavor won’t change, so eat up.
174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,750
Okay…
175
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,080
Oh my… It really is good!
176
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,490
Right? Right?
177
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,160
Say… What happened to the others?
178
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,000
The thief just put us to sleep…
179
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,290
There wasn’t such a great deal
of damage.
180
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,370
I see.
181
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,910
You okay?
182
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,290
Thanks for saving my butt back there!
183
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,620
Is there something wrong with you?
184
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,490
No…nothing at all…
185
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,830
After Mizura began the star training,
he started to feel poorly…
186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,290
Hokuto! Don’t be talking about the star
187
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,660
to someone from another village!
188
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,750
Are you okay, Mizura…?!
189
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,250
I’m sorry. I got carried away…
190
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,450
Other village…
You guys are kind of cold-hearted.
191
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,330
Especially that Sumaru guy…
192
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,490
I’m sorry…
193
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,000
But there’s a reason
why Sumaru became like that.
194
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,910
What?
195
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,370
It happened ten years ago…
196
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,410
Sumaru’s parents who
were protecting the star
197
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,490
were killed by Ninja from
some other village…
198
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,660
who came to steal the star.
199
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,250
So probably, he’s…
200
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,490
So that’s what it was about…
That’s why he got like that.
201
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,290
So where is Sumaru…?
And where the other guys?
202
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,200
It seems everyone went
to take back the star.
203
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,490
Huh?!
204
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,250
Oh!
205
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,490
Naru…to?
206
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,490
They’ve come out.
207
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,490
Right…
208
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,830
We should take them on
fair and square here…
209
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,540
Idiot! There’d be no point
to surveillance!
210
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,490
I’m not much one for
sniffing around secretly.
211
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,580
Be quiet. They’ll notice us!
212
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,790
Leave the trailing Ninjutsu to me…
Follow me quietly!
213
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,830
But…
214
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,950
It’s a mission!
215
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,620
I understand…
216
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,830
Let’s go…!
217
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,830
Secretly, secretly…
218
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,000
It’s okay… They haven’t noticed.
219
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,490
But I get the feeling this kind of thing
goes against my Way of Ninja…
220
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,870
Don’t complain!
221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,490
Secretly, secretly…
222
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,290
You don’t need to say secretly, secretly!
223
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,200
But is this really a trailing Ninjutsu?
224
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,870
Uh-oh…
225
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,620
Have we been noticed?
226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,750
Wait…
227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,490
It appears we weren’t noticed…
228
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,490
Let’s continue trailing them!
229
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,000
Right! They turned right!
230
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,580
R-Roger!
231
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,660
They vanished…
232
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,410
Did they give us the slip?
233
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,200
Could it be, they noticed us?
234
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,620
Wait…! We’re not enemies!
235
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,910
That’s right!
236
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,540
We came here on a mission from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
237
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,870
Oh-ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say?
238
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,700
Then aren’t you guys trailing
the wrong people?
239
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,290
That might be so.
240
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,250
But there’s the possibility that
you guys have transformed
241
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,830
into people from this village, so…
242
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,620
Brave words.
243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,490
I apologize for the rudeness…
244
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,000
But now the star has been stolen.
245
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,330
And we don’t have any leads…
246
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,250
So that’s why
you were investigating us, huh…?
247
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,040
That was unnecessary…
248
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,040
Oh well… We will take back
the star with our own hands.
249
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,910
You guys just make sure
you don’t get in our way!
250
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,700
They kind of tick me off…
251
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,830
But it’s as Neji said…
252
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,790
It seems there’s some kind
of secret in this village, eh?
253
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,000
Seems so…
254
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,040
Everyone…join hands!
255
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Listen up! Pick up the same
star Chakra as us!
256
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,700
There he is!
257
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,250
You can’t cut a rope woven
with Chakra!
258
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,040
Give back the star!
That’s our life!
259
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,750
Neji, have you seen Sumaru
and the others?
260
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,950
You weren’t keeping watch of him?
261
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,490
Actually, it seems most of the guys
went out to look for the star.
262
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,870
I see…
263
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,660
Hey… is it okay to be all relaxed?
264
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,370
Hey, is something wrong?
265
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,040
There’s massive Chakra
at the Valley of Death.
266
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,700
Did he appear again?!
267
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,660
Let’s go!
268
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,490
All right!
269
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,700
G-Give back our…star…
270
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,580
Give it back…
271
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,910
Hold it!
272
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,870
Eat this!
273
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,490
Ninja Art: Kujaku!
274
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,490
I won’t let you get away!
275
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,620
Hold it!
276
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
Farewell!
277
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,490
Wh-What?!
278
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,500
Damn you!
279
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,490
Wait!
280
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,330
Let me go! Let me go, I say!
281
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,290
Calm down!
282
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,490
Up ahead is the valley filled
with poison gas…
283
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,870
O-Okay…
284
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,200
You would’ve been dead meat in
a few seconds without that mask on…
285
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,490
Damn it. We almost had him.
286
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,160
So that was the Shinobi
who stole the star?
287
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,830
Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it!
288
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,490
Why? Why is it necessary
to go out of his way
289
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,700
to take Sumaru away although
he carried out his goal already?
290
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,370
Does that have something to do
291
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,790
with the star being targeted
ten years ago?
292
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,290
At that time, it seems Sumaru’s parents
got killed protecting the star.
293
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,450
What?!
294
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,660
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
295
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,490
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
296
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,000
Yellow Moon.
297
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,830
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
298
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:04,040
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
299
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,000
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
300
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:17,870
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
301
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:24,580
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
302
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:31,490
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
303
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,120
A magical chord change, in a restless city
304
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,160
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
305
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,490
We need to reinvestigate
the village leader and his relations.
306
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,870
Please leave it to me!
I’ve got an ace strategy.
307
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,120
A strategy?
308
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,040
I can’t count on Tenten’s
trailing Ninjutsu, can I?
309
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,160
What did you say?!
310
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,080
Do whatever you want.
Just follow through with it.
311
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,580
All right! Here I go!
312
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,250
We’ll see how good you are.
313
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,490
Then, me, too…
314
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,490
Hold it, Naruto.
315
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,870
Next: “Hidden Jutsu!
The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku.”
//%
1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,600
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,010
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,470
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,680
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,180
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,260
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,100
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,430
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,850
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,390
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,890
Pure Betrayal,
and a Fleeting Plea!
21
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,300
Summoning Jutsu!
22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,140
Naruto! Grab on!
23
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,590
Okay, pull him up!
24
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,800
There, eh?!
25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,590
Damn! Was it a clone?!
26
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,590
Over here!
27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,140
Counterattack, here it comes!
28
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,590
Rasengan, go!
29
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,590
What--?!
30
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,590
You little…!
31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,800
Yes!
32
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,140
Be careful, Naruto!
There are two others hiding!
33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,970
Hey, there they are!
34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,760
Kagero!
35
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,510
Let’s retreat for now!
36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,600
Hold it!
37
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,260
Th-They’re totally quick
at running away!
38
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,010
Naruto, why’re you spacing out?!
39
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,640
Where’s Sakura?
40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,350
Oh! Oh, no!
41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,850
Sakura!
42
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,590
Oh! Naruto…
43
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,350
Thank goodness!
You’re okay, Sasame.
44
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,140
Yes… Sasame’s okay.
45
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
Sasame's totally okay.
46
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,050
What’re you mad about?
47
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,680
Let’s take a break here.
48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,590
Sakura…Who’s the cute girl?
49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,590
Okay! That’s close enough…
50
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,850
What’s the deal…Sakura?
51
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,640
Okay, don’t come any closer!
52
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,550
Wh-What… I’m only interested
in adult women!
53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,050
You must not misunderstand…!
54
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,180
Don’t misunderstand!
55
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,590
It’s not a misunderstanding.
56
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,890
It seems Sakura’s finally figured out
Pervy Sage’s true nature!
57
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,850
I told you to stop calling me
a “Pervy Sage”!
58
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,640
Then you’re the Lewd Sage!
59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,260
Both of you stop it! Sasame’s scared!
60
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,350
– Okay. 					– Okay.
61
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,800
Jeez…
62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,470
This girl is Sasame…
63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,300
She’s a Ninja from
the Land of Rice Paddies…
64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,510
A member of the Fuma Clan.
65
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,140
She had her cousin taken away
by Orochimaru
66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,850
and was looking for his hideout.
67
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,590
Right. And the Ninja just now
were after Sasame
68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,100
in order to protect the secret
of the hideout!
69
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,350
Oh…With the Fuma Clan, huh?
70
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,970
Huh?! You know?
71
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,590
I had contact with Ninja in the town
who’d left the Fuma Clan.
72
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,050
What! So you were actually doing
some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!
73
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,260
I-I can’t believe it…!
74
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,390
Well you see, when I went to
this nice-looking bar,
75
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,590
it just turned out to be their hideout.
76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,220
What! So after all, you were just
hanging out with some girls, right?
77
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,550
You mustn’t talk in a way that’ll
lead to a misunderstanding!
78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,100
Even Sakura who respects me will…
79
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,050
I’ve long since stopped respecting you!
80
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,970
I…I see…
81
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,510
Members of the Fuma Clan…?
82
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,930
Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki
or something…
83
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,300
Hanzaki and the others are traitors
who abandoned the clan.
84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,590
Oh…
85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,590
Did those people do something?
86
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,470
They were after my travel money,
so I taught them a lesson.
87
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,590
While at it, I attempted to ask them about
Orochimaru’s hideout…
88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,010
but they didn’t know anything.
89
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,600
I can show you the way to
Orochimaru’s hideout.
90
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,590
For real?!
91
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,300
Yes…
92
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,050
All right!
93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Your wound hasn’t healed yet.
Don’t push yourself.
94
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,890
Yes…but…
95
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,550
This is the entrance to
the Village Hidden in Sound.
96
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,590
Orochimaru’s hideout is deep
in those mountains…
97
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,100
I bet Sasuke is
somewhere in those mountains…
98
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,220
Okay, at last!
99
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,890
Let’s hurry!
100
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,140
Well, hold on…
101
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,590
Why?!
102
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,510
If we don’t hurry, night will fall before
we arrive at Orochimaru’s hideout…
103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,800
That’s right!
104
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,470
Sasuke is just a stone’s throw away!
Pervy Sage!
105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,350
If we’re going to save him,
we should do it as soon as possible!
106
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,430
Why do we have to wait?!
107
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,140
Huh…?
108
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,590
What?
109
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,590
Gee…
110
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,390
Well…I’m hungry, you see…
111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,590
You know… All Shinobi must …
112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,930
I can’t fight if I’m hungry!
113
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,050
Up ahead will become full-blown
enemy territory.
114
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,800
We won’t have time to
have relaxed meals, so…
115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,260
Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!
116
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,720
Mm, this is good…
117
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,430
You prepared this especially for us?
118
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,550
No. It seems the prettiest girl
in the bar fell to my charm, you see.
119
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,590
She made these with tender loving care.
120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
I’ll go make some tea.
121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,100
Oh…thanks…
122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Tastes pretty good.
123
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,590
Tea is ready.
124
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,590
Here you go!
125
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,220
Here you go.
126
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,350
Thanks…
127
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,680
Here you go.
128
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,640
Thank you, Sasame…
129
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,430
Sasame, you should come here
and eat with us, too.
130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,590
Okay…
131
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Pervy Sage…What’s wrong…?!
132
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,100
Naruto…!
133
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,930
Sasame did it…
134
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,640
Since it’s come to this, they’re ours.
135
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,800
Your wound still hasn’t healed.
136
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,600
Kagero, you wait here.
137
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,680
No mistake…They’re Leaf Ninja.
138
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,640
If we take care of the Leaf pursuers…
139
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,300
Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge
the power of the Fuma Clan.
140
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,260
Yeah…
141
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,590
Let’s come back with good news.
142
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,260
And with the heads of
the Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!
143
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,590
I finally found it!
144
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,760
At first, I thought it was someone
from the Hidden Leaf Village.
145
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,600
But it’s Sasame, believe it or not…
146
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,510
Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero…
147
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,760
This is an odd reunion.
148
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,590
Where’s Arashi?!
He wasn’t with all you guys?!
149
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,590
Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru
and is spending his days training.
150
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
Can I see Arashi?!
151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,470
If you’re also going to work together
with us for Lord Orochimaru,
152
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,140
I’m sure you’ll be able to see him.
153
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,930
How’d it go?
154
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,590
You’ve done well.
155
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,510
With this, I’ll be able to see Arashi, right?
156
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,590
After we’ve finished them off!
157
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,100
Why?! Weren’t we just supposed to
take them to Lord Orochimaru
158
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,180
for examination after capturing them?!
159
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,760
We only need the heads
for the examination.
160
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,300
No!
161
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,600
These people… For my sake…!
162
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,550
Move it!
163
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,590
– Wha--?! 					– Huh?!
164
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,300
What?!
165
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,590
The Fuma numbing medicine
didn’t work!
166
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,140
We knew about it all along
from the beginning!
167
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,930
Sakura!
168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,300
Substitution…?!
169
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,760
I leave Sasame to you!
170
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,850
Leave her to me!
171
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,220
Sasame… Hang in there!
172
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,470
Why…? Why does Sasame have
to do something like this?!
173
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,550
No, it’s not that she’s doing it
against her will…!
174
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,760
It’s something she wanted to do!
175
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,970
Liar!
176
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,220
It’s true…
177
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,470
What…
178
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,550
What should I do to be able
to see Arashi again?
179
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,550
It’s not a difficult thing.
180
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,300
You just have to put the lights out of those
who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.
181
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,300
We have to kill them…?!
182
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,600
We’ll take them back to Lord Orochimaru
for examination.
183
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,430
So we’re not going to kill, right?
184
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,720
If we carry out that work,
Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.
185
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,010
Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone
are being tricked by Orochimaru.
186
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,600
He says that you’ll just be used
and thrown away…
187
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,390
Hanzaki’s just a traitor
who abandoned the village.
188
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,590
Will you believe what we say?
189
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,590
Or will you believe what a traitor says?
190
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,850
Lord Orochimaru will surely restore
our Fuma Clan…
191
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,300
Sasame, although you’re still young,
you’re also one of the Fuma.
192
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,430
Assist in the restoration
of our Fuma Clan…
193
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,590
So you guys did trick Sasame!
194
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,590
It’s all for the restoration
of the Fuma Clan!
195
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,590
You little!
196
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,600
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
197
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,300
Here I go!
198
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,050
Wha--!
199
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,850
U-zu-ma-ki…!
200
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,390
Naruto Barrage!
201
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,590
This is bad…!
202
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,890
Rasengan!
203
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,590
This is for Sasame.
Prepare yourselves!
204
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,300
Naruto!
205
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,930
You’re…from before?!
206
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,590
The Earth Style Jutsu user
in question, huh?
207
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,470
However, there’s no point to using that
Art in this rocky area.
208
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,430
Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from
inside the ground
209
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,600
and the spreading of its wings under
the sunlight is
210
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,850
but a momentary gleam.
211
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,140
That’s when I die as Kagero!
212
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Be careful!
213
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,300
What’s this…?
214
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,970
Look! Naruto…
215
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,850
Wha--?!
216
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,470
U-Unbelievable!
217
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,390
You were a woman…?!
218
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,220
The clan will once again be
in a place lit by the sunlight…
219
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,680
Lord Orochimaru promised that…
220
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,180
I’ll use this once-in-a-lifetime Art
if it’s for the sake of that.
221
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,590
Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!
222
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,890
Naruto! Come with me!
223
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,300
Naruto!
224
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,850
I-I feel like…I’ve seen this before…
225
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,010
It’s Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.
226
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,100
I summoned the extraordinarily
sturdy stomach of
227
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,470
the Mount Myoboku’s
lwajuku Giant Toad.
228
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,180
Stomach…?
229
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,760
Yikes!
230
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,050
It’s melting…
231
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,510
If I didn’t do this,
232
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,640
we wouldn’t have been able to
defend ourselves from her Chakra.
233
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,800
I believed…that the clan
would someday…
234
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,720
I believed in that.
235
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,760
Sh-She vanished.
236
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,390
I’ve got to hand it to her.
237
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,100
She probably put all of her life
on the line
238
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,350
and attempted to save her comrades…
239
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,590
It’s unforgivable!
240
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,510
Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja…
241
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,390
Their feelings toward the clan
is the same as our feelings!
242
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:11,260
Manipulating the Fuma’s desire
to restore their clan…
243
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,590
I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt, no matter what!
244
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,010
Wh-Where are we?
245
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,590
Kagero…!
246
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,640
You risked your life to save us?
247
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,550
You idiot…
248
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,100
Please…
249
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,010
Please use your Medical Ninjutsu
to save her.
250
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,140
Our comrade doesn’t have
long to live!
251
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,600
Put your hands to your chests and think.
252
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,300
Think about what you weren’t
able to accomplish…okay?
253
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,890
We risked our lives working for you…
to help you, Lord Orochimaru.
254
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,510
In order to restore the Fuma Clan!
255
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,680
Please recognize our work!
256
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,890
You’ll just have to atone for
your failure with your bodies.
257
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,430
Lord Orochimaru!
258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,180
I’m sorry for the betrayal!
259
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,590
When I recalled the parts one by one,
260
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:34,800
I felt as though
I had understood everything
261
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:45,510
Faded words which I kept so close to me
262
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:55,220
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
263
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,970
and this distant yearning for you
264
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:11,350
I live, simply repeating this cycle
265
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:22,970
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
266
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:33,510
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
267
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,180
I’ll keep these thoughts…
268
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,390
That’s Orochimaru’s residence!
269
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,930
It really is just like him to construct
his residence underground.
270
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,590
Sasuke is somewhere inside
that residence, right?
271
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,100
Sakura, let’s hurry!
272
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,590
Right!
273
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,590
Be careful!
First Avenue of hell is up ahead!
274
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,350
Will a devil appear,
or will a snake appear?
275
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,010
Heh! I’m looking forward to it!
276
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,800
I’ll kick the butts of the devil
and the snake.
277
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,590
And I’ll save Sasuke and Arashi!
278
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,720
Next episode, “Pure Terror!
The House of Orochimaru”
//%
1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,110
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:29,940
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,320
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,490
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,650
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,200
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,070
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,200
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,360
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,030
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:28,990
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,940
Don’t forget your objective…
13
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,950
Don’t go!
14
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,070
Thank you…
15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
Sasuke…
16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,610
Formation!
The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!
17
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,570
It’s already four o’clock
in the morning…
18
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,360
That Fifth Hokage is
a real slave driver.
19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,110
She ought to retrieve
the documents she forgot herself…
20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,740
Huh… What’s the matter?
21
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,940
Hey! Wake up!
22
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,240
You’ll catch cold if you sleep
in a place like this.
23
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
Thank you…
24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,990
Huh!
25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,200
Sasuke!
26
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
Good work…
27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,860
Fifth Hokage! You were asleep
just now, weren’t you?
28
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,070
When you made us
go to fetch the documents!
29
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,990
And only you got to sleep!
30
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,940
More importantly, Lady Hokage,
31
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,740
there’s something
I want to report to you.
32
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,400
What is it?
33
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,360
What did you just say?!
34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,280
Is that true?!
35
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,650
Yes…
36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,940
According to Sakura Haruno,
it appears that there’s no mistake…
37
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,610
Unbelievable…
That they should already be on the move…
38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,940
In addition to getting what I want…
39
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,650
This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village.
40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,150
So what that pervert wants...
41
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
is the Uchiha’s powers, huh…
42
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,940
Izumo! Kotetsu!
43
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,450
There’s somebody
I want you to bring here!
44
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,030
Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru!
Your Dad’s mission starts today, too!
45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,700
There’s not that much time
for morning training!
46
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
OK, OK.
47
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,110
One OK is enough!
48
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,400
Nag, nag, nag from early
in the morning…
49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,860
I wonder who it could be
so early in the morning?
50
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,950
Hey…Dad…
51
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,260
What is it?
52
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,610
Why did you marry
a hard-edged woman like Mom?
53
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,940
Let’s see now…
54
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,900
Even though Mom's like that,
she smiles gently sometimes…
55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,780
Maybe that’s why…
56
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,820
Is that the only reason?
57
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,700
Shikamaru!
58
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,280
A messenger of the Fifth Hokage
is here.
59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,900
Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out
of the village late last night.
60
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,780
And…there is almost no mistake
61
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,450
that he is headed for
the Village Hidden in the Sound!
62
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,940
Slipped out?! Why…
63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,110
Because he was enticed by
that Orochimaru!
64
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,360
W-W-Wait a minute!
65
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,940
Why does Sasuke have to be enticed
by a risky guy like that?!
66
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,900
The reason doesn’t matter.
ln any case, there’s no time.
67
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,400
You will perform your first mission
as a Chunin…
68
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,990
So all I have to do
is bring Sasuke back?
69
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,490
As long as there aren’t
any enemies around,
70
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,780
that shouldn’t be
too much of a hassle…
71
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,780
Yes… However, not only is time
of the essence on this mission,
72
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,240
but it may turn into something
quite difficult.
73
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,110
Huh?!
74
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,070
There is a strong possibility that
75
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,940
those under the control of Orochimaru
are guiding Sasuke.
76
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,940
This is turning into a real pain
in the neck.
77
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:28,940
That guy… I held him in high respect
in so many different ways…
78
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,490
In that case, please give me
a four-man team
79
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,940
composed only of Jonin and Chunin.
80
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,990
I’m afraid I can’t do that…
81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Huh! Why?!
82
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,940
You already know
the answer to that…
83
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,570
Right now, only the barest minimum
number of Jonin have been left behind
84
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,110
and the others have all
left the village on missions.
85
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,240
Within the next 30 minutes,
86
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,860
I want you to gather all the Genin you
consider the best, and leave this village!
87
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,780
It’s a drag but…
88
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,030
I know the guy,
so I just can’t just let the matter go.
89
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,530
What shall be, shall be…
90
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,940
There’s one guy
I want to recommend.
91
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,900
What! You’ve gotta be kidding!
92
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,950
You are such a drag starting
so early in the morning…
93
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,320
But why this guy?
94
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,650
That jerk!
95
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,610
Hey, just wait here!
96
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,990
I’ll change my clothes immediately!
97
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,940
So, do you have your eye…
98
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,610
on any other guys besides me
who are excellent?
99
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,200
Yeah…
100
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,570
Wake up! Hey!
101
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,940
You said excellent guys, right…
102
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,650
Can’t be helped…
103
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,940
Potato chips?
104
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,150
They’re barbecued meat flavor…
you help out too!
105
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,940
Huh?!
106
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,450
Here he comes!
107
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,070
Even if it is just potato chips,
108
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,110
I won’t let anybody else have
the last piece, no matter who you are.
109
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,700
Choji and I have worked as
a team for many years,
110
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,280
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.
111
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,900
I understand that,
112
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,360
but in this kind of situation,
one would normally solicit Shino first!
113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,780
Oh, shut up.
114
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Fat chance...!
115
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,570
Shino is on a special mission
with his father.
116
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,530
Hey…don’t tell me…
117
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,940
Right. He's in.
118
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,150
No way...!
119
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,940
I see… Sounds interesting…
120
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,860
It looks like it was worth getting up early
and going for a walk, doesn’t it?
121
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,070
Shikamaru, what about the other guys?
122
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,940
I’d like to take my time to look for some,
but we’re pressed for time.
123
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,240
If we don’t find anybody else
by the time we leave the village,
124
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,610
it will be just us!
125
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,240
It appears that your operation
was a success.
126
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,360
Yeah…
127
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,110
Is it okay for you
to be released already?
128
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,940
I was told that I would be able
to undertake light training soon.
129
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,940
I see…
130
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
I see…
131
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,900
It’s a hassle,
but the more people the better…
132
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,940
Damn… At a time like this, I…
133
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,780
Lee! Do what you need to do.
134
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,200
I’ll climb these steps alone
starting tomorrow!
135
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,150
Lee…
136
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,150
I’ll be fine! You go!
137
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,650
We’re at our time limit!
138
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,400
Well, I’ve assembled five people…
139
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,780
All right! Everybody, follow me!
140
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,740
Hey…
141
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,610
Hey, Naruto…
142
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,030
I’m supposed to be the squad leader.
Though it sure is a drag…
143
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,700
You really think everything will be okay
if things are left in your hands?
144
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,700
You don’t seem very reliable…
145
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,030
What’s up with you acting
like the boss, Naruto?
146
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,950
Although being ordered about by
some unmotivated guy like Shikamaru
147
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,280
doesn’t sit right with me either…
148
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!
149
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,940
We have to follow his orders.
150
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,740
What that means is that
the elders of the village recognized him
151
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,320
as capable of being a leader.
152
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,110
Since that’s the case,
come up with some strategy and plan.
153
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,240
From what I heard,
there are enemies
154
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,570
and there’s a strong possibility
that they’re gonna ambush us.
155
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,240
For a start,
as this is a rescue operation,
156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,940
we will be in the position
of pursuit.
157
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,950
In other words,
the enemy can easily gain the initiative.
158
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,570
Therefore, I will decide
on a deployment formation
159
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,940
that will respond quickly
to any assault by the enemy.
160
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,610
If you ignore me and
move of your own accord,
161
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,950
we will all die.
162
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,940
We will go in a single file formation.
163
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,940
First of all,
the all-important spearhead will be…
164
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,110
Kiba, that’s you!
165
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,030
You and Akamaru go on
walks year round
166
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,110
and are therefore well-versed in the terrain
and geography of the Land of Fire.
167
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,940
And since your nose is
very sensitive,
168
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,990
you can track Sasuke
with your sense of smell and,
169
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,820
you can distinguish booby traps
that carry the enemy’s scent
170
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,950
which makes them
easy to find…
171
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,700
And moreover, you and Akamaru as
a pair will be extremely efficient
172
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,990
in compensating for the weakness
of a single file formation to assault.
173
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,700
And…second in line will be me,
the squad leader.
174
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,950
I can give orders
as required in any situation
175
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,110
from my position
directly behind Kiba
176
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,950
and can give orders to those behind me
using only hand signals.
177
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,950
And in the middle...
in the number three position is Naruto.
178
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,700
The middle position is
the best for you,
179
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,860
since you're capable
of executing quick moves
180
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,940
and are able to respond immediately
to anything in front or behind.
181
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,070
You're the cornerstone...
And you have Shadow Clone, too.
182
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,030
And fourth in line is Choji.
183
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,610
You. You don't have speed,
184
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,030
but your ability to strike is the best
among the squad members.
185
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,940
Line leader Kiba, I, and Naruto
will launch a surprise attack
186
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,700
and I’ll use you to launch
the deciding blow.
187
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,820
In other words, your role is
to attack the routed enemy.
188
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,940
And then, on the tail end
will be you, Neji…
189
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,530
You are assigned to
the most difficult position of rear lookout.
190
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,950
You will use your Byakugan
to constantly check
191
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,740
that there are no loopholes
in the ranks.
192
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,030
Got it? Take a careful look at this.
193
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,950
Use this diagram to verify
the radius of your assigned watch.
194
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,780
Kiba watches the front,
195
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,110
I’m responsible for
a wide forward view,
196
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,570
Naruto watches left, Choji right,
and Neji…
197
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,320
Using your Byakugan,
you cover the entire area to the rear.
198
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,150
I want to familiarize myself
with our current military potential.
199
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,450
Let me check all the Ninja equipment
each of you currently has…
200
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,700
I will commit that
to memory straight away.
201
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,780
Any questions?
202
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,110
Even though he just assembled
his men a short while ago,
203
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,940
he’s already created
the best possible formation…
204
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,940
If not, I want to tell you
the most important thing last.
205
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,940
Sasuke and I aren’t close friends.
206
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,200
In fact, I don’t particularly like him.
207
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,070
However, he is also a Shinobi belonging
to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
208
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,570
He is a comrade!
209
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Therefore, I will put my life
on the line to help him!
210
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,320
That’s the way
of the Leaf Village.
211
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,740
In this case, even I can’t just sit back
and be a sluggard.
212
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,400
Because I am responsible
for your lives.
213
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,650
Wow… You’re acting kind of
like a Chunin, aren’t you?!
214
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,530
Okay then, as soon as he's checked
our Ninja tools, we’ll depart.
215
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,860
Everybody, take out your Ninja tools.
216
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,940
Sasuke wouldn’t fall victim
to that kind of guy’s enticement…
217
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,110
He’s already
a really powerful guy,
218
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,360
so he wouldn’t need to do
that kind of thing! I guarantee it!
219
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,650
Damn… Why, Sasuke…?!
220
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,400
All right! Let’s go!
221
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,110
Wait!
222
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,950
Sakura!
223
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,030
I heard the whole story
from Lady Hokage.
224
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,530
I’m sorry, but I can’t take you along
on this mission.
225
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,900
Even you weren’t able
to convince Sasuke, right?
226
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,940
All that can be done now is for us
to use force to convince him…
227
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,940
Sakura, your role in this has ended.
228
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,940
Which means, Sakura,
that you and Sasuke…?!
229
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,860
Sakura…
230
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,030
Naruto… This is a…
once in a lifetime request...
231
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,940
Please bring…
please bring Sasuke back.
232
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,820
I couldn’t do it!
I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!
233
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,280
At this point, the only person
who would be able to stop Sasuke…
234
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,700
who would be able to save him…
235
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,740
is you…Naruto…
236
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,940
You like Sasuke so much,
don’t you, Sakura?
237
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,280
I understand to my very core
238
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,200
how painful it must be
for you right now, Sakura.
239
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,860
Sakura, there’s one thing
I want to ask you.
240
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,860
Huh?
241
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,940
How do you feel about…Naruto?
242
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,450
Thwarting someone’s love seems
to have become natural to him.
243
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,610
He actually seems to be enjoying
my suffering.
244
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,240
Naruto doesn’t understand
the least thing about me.
245
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,940
He’s just annoying.
246
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,070
Naruto…thank you…
247
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,150
I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!
I promise that on my life!
248
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320
You always understood me…
249
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,240
You always helped me…
250
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,940
Naruto…
251
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,150
Hey, hey, Naruto!
252
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,740
You really think you’re gonna be okay
saying that kind of thing?!
253
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,860
Sure! I will not go back on my word.
254
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,940
That’s my Way of the Ninja!
255
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,450
All right! Let’s hurry up and go!
256
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,860
We’ve lost a little time…
Let’s hurry!
257
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,940
OK!
258
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,070
Naruto struck the pose of
a nice guy as he said that…
259
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,110
It’ll all be all right now.
260
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,940
I’m positive…
I’m positive that it will all go well!
261
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,110
Master Sasuke… Around here will do,
don’t you think?
262
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,820
We’ve already exited
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
263
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,030
What is that?
264
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,360
To tell you the truth,
265
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,940
Orochimaru has given us
one important task…
266
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,240
So…what is it?
267
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,490
It will be necessary for you
to die once…
268
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:32,280
Once in a long while, once in a while
269
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,940
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
270
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,150
Look like a mountain
271
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:53,530
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
272
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,030
The remnants of a person crying
273
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,070
Look like a mountain
274
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,940
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
275
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,820
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
276
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,940
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
277
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,150
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
278
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,490
Look like a mountain
279
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,740
Look like a mountain
280
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,240
Look like a mountain
281
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,570
Look like a mountain
282
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,940
From here on up, there's more danger
of traps and ambushes.
283
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,940
– Stay alert and use all your senses.
– Roger that!
284
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,240
– Find the enemy before he gets you.
– You can count on me!
285
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,240
– And any signs of the enemy--
– Right!
286
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,150
Say, are you listening?!
287
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,780
Not to worry.
No matter who the enemy may be,
288
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,400
I'll thrash him with
my new technique!
289
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm a fool to
even attempt to explain.
290
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,570
Next time:
"Sound vs. Leaf"
//%
1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,990
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,200
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,370
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,530
I'll laugh with  you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,080
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,950
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:05,080
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,240
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,910
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:28,870
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,530
This is not good,
looks like a storm is coming.
13
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,580
What?
14
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Idate…
15
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,820
Run Idate Run!
Nagi Island Awaits!
16
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,820
Aoi…Rokusho!
17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,160
I thought you had run away.
18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,820
Wasn’t running away
your specialty?
19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,700
Shut up!
20
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,620
I’m different from you!
21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,820
No, you are the same kind
of human as I am.
22
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,910
A betrayer who doesn’t trust others.
23
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,330
Betraying your own brother,
walking away from the village,
24
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,700
and capable of thinking only of yourself.
The worst kind of man.
25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,820
Such a man…
doesn't deserve to live!
26
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,700
Die!
27
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,990
Sakura, is your wound okay?
28
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:12,870
Uh-huh.
29
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,280
A wound like this is nothing.
30
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,830
But…
31
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,330
Those Rain Ninja…huh?
32
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,240
Yes.
33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,450
Hah, they’re nothing!
34
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,200
No, it’s not that!
lf they’re headed towards Idate…
35
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,160
Oh! Idate is in danger!
36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,410
That’s what I’ve been saying!
37
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,490
Hey, Naruto!
This is no time to be playing around.
38
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,820
No!
39
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,620
They’re here now.
40
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,820
Naruto!
41
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,530
Lucky us!
42
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,240
We are invincible in water.
43
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,240
Geez, what a troublesome guy.
44
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,660
They’ve now fallen into our trap.
45
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,280
Water Clone Jutsu!
46
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,820
Sakura!
47
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,910
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
48
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,410
How stupid. What use can
Shadow Clones have in this situation?
49
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,870
There’s no way they can defeat
our Water Clones in water.
50
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,910
Even if you try to trick us,
51
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,820
I'm hanging on to the real body
right here.
52
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,240
What are they trying to do?
53
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,950
N-No way!
54
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,830
What a whirlpool…
Chakra is intertwined in it!
55
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,820
Naruto…you…
56
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,580
This is the application
of the first step
57
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,530
in my training for
the Rasengan!
58
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,160
Sakura!
59
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,700
Sakura, hang in there!
60
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,820
Sakura! Just hang in there!
61
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,820
Come on! Sakura!
62
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,240
Sakura!
63
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,200
Pull yourself together! Sakura!
64
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,780
I-I guess…I’ve got…to…do it…
65
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,990
S-Sasuke.…
66
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,620
I’d like it if Sasuke is the one to do…
67
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,280
the CPR…
68
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
S-Sakura…
69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,910
What the hell are you doing, idiot!
70
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,820
Sasuke?
71
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,820
We don’t have any time to spare.
We need to meet up with Idate.
72
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,580
Wait, Sasuke.
73
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,740
Hey… Don’t leave me.
74
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
It's about time…
75
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,580
Fukusuke reaches Modoroki Shrine.
76
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,830
There’s no chance for you
to win now.
77
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,700
You can’t even run
or stand up now.
78
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,030
When that pain spreads
throughout your whole body,
79
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,120
you’ll reach a different finish line.
80
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,160
The finish line of death.
81
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,530
What are you thinking of doing
with that dirty knife?
82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,280
Don’t touch it!
83
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,620
Looks like you still don’t understand
your situation.
84
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,410
All you have to do is run away.
85
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,620
You have no right to even
the slightest bit of integrity.
86
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,120
Boss…
87
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm sorry…
88
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,910
Boss…
89
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,830
I couldn't keep…
90
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,910
the promise I made with you.
91
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,910
Idate!
92
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,820
You bastard!
93
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,990
Darn, what a downpour.
94
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,160
Are you the boss of the Rain Ninja?!
95
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,450
Looks like it was too hard
a task for them.
96
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,580
Even if they were
the same Genin as you,
97
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,820
seems like the Hidden Leaf ones
are better.
98
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
This is terrible…
99
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,700
But can Genin-level Ninja
fight against me?
100
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,820
Shut up!
101
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:49,910
Above!
102
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,870
Humph… So that's your level, after all.
103
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,740
I'll use the same method
I used on Idate,
104
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,080
and send you to hell.
105
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,160
No need to waste my Chakra.
106
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,780
Sakura!
107
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,240
Th-These darned things…
108
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,330
Those are poisoned needles specially
made by the Hidden Rain Village.
109
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
They will send you to hell
in a few minutes,
110
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
no matter how strong you are.
111
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Don’t you look down on us! Bastard--!
112
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,410
Looks like Fukusuke has reached
Modoroki Shrine.
113
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,910
Die gasping.
114
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,870
It’s a death
that fits you Genin brats well.
115
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,830
Is Wagarashi winning this one too?
116
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,580
Isn’t there a God or Buddha
in this world?
117
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,700
I miss the old times when
Jirocho was in charge.
118
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,870
Terrible, terrible, I’m drenched.
119
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,820
You are amazing, Fukusuke.
120
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,700
Keep on running to the goal,
and make our Boss Wagarashi happy.
121
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,160
Watch it, you scum.
122
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,450
Who do you think you are talking to?
123
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,700
What?
124
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,030
My victory is already assured.
Let me relax for a while.
125
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,820
Bastard, think you're so hot?!
126
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,620
Cut it out…
127
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,200
Brother…
128
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,700
What if something goes wrong
during the race?
129
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,990
Who knows what our boss
will do to us.
130
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,820
All right.
131
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,580
Just wait and see.
132
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,280
Darn, that bastard!
133
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,030
Naruto, Sasuke…
134
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,700
Take this.
135
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,910
Sakura… What's that?
136
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,580
Before leaving the Leaf Village,
137
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,820
Lady Tsunade handed this to me.
138
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,700
Take this with you.
I am sure it will come in handy.
139
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,620
Old Lady Tsunade?
140
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,330
I think he’ll recover
consciousness now.
141
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,700
Sasuke and Naruto,
you take this, too.
142
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,120
O-Okay.
143
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,200
Also, we’ll be too cold here,
so we need to move somewhere else.
144
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,580
Brother!
145
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,990
Look! I’ve finally become
a Ninja, too!
146
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,780
I see…
147
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,530
I’ve got to become the best
in everything!
148
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,820
I’ll train hard,
and complete lots of missions.
149
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,240
And I’ll become a Chunin super fast.
150
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,700
Then after that, a Jonin.
151
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,160
I’m going to be like you, Brother!
152
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,660
I’m Idate, the Swift Runner
making headway in life.
153
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,200
Brother?
154
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,820
Listen Idate…
155
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,700
In the world of Shinobi,
156
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,200
there is something more important
than success or power.
157
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,780
Something more important?
158
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,820
Until you understand that,
it’s too early for you to talk that way.
159
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,030
Oh!
160
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,820
He’s conscious now.
161
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,870
Are you okay?
162
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,450
What happened to Aoi?!
163
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,410
He disappeared…
164
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,080
So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi?
165
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,450
Idate, do you know him?
166
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,830
He…
167
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,120
was a teacher when
I was in the Leaf Village.
168
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,700
You…are from the Leaf Village?
169
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Aoi…betrayed the Leaf Village
170
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,330
and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain.
171
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,280
What the hell do you mean?
172
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,160
Not yet.
173
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,120
You have to rest a little more.
174
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
How is your hand there?
175
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,820
That hand…
176
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,820
You kept it clenched all this time.
177
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,820
Darn! I’d come all this way,
and yet I…!
178
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
It’s too early to give up!
179
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,820
And you tell us that you were once
a Shinobi of the Leaf?!
180
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,370
I forgot all about the Leaf…
181
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,530
the moment
I walked away from the village.
182
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,820
You walked away from the village?
183
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,950
I was depressed after failing
the first test of the Chunin Exam.
184
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,910
That was close, Idate…
185
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,700
Don’t take it so hard.
186
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,990
There are ways to become
a Chunin other than the Chunin Exam.
187
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,820
Really?!
188
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,700
Yes, really.
189
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,450
Just do as I tell you.
190
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,030
Okay!
191
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,830
Aoi Sensei…
192
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,870
Idate…
193
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,280
Aoi Sensei,
I’d brought them as you told me to.
194
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,820
All right.
195
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,330
These are indeed the Scroll of Sealing
and the legendary blade,
196
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,820
the Blade of the Thunder God, believed to
have been used by the Second Hokage.
197
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,830
Well done, Idate.
198
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,200
Now I can become a Chunin, right?
199
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,820
Sure you can…
200
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,820
in the Village Hidden in the Rain.
201
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,240
You are leaving
the Leaf together with me,
202
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,490
taking these as gifts to them.
203
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,740
But…
204
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,280
Of course.
205
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,240
There's no way you can get away with
stealing the village’s treasures.
206
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,660
You tricked me!
207
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,820
To survive in this world,
you must not believe in others…
208
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,820
Remember that.
209
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,740
Well, what are you going to do, Idate?
210
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,700
Either way, you are already
a Rogue Ninja.
211
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,330
You’ll be chained in jail for life,
if you are lucky.
212
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,370
You’ll be chained in jail for life,
if you are lucky.
213
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Ever since then,
I haven’t returned to the village.
214
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,780
I am an irresponsible man
who can’t do a single thing right.
215
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,370
But Boss Jirocho believed in me.
216
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,370
Even though I'd never
been of any use to him.
217
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,620
Boss Jirocho had faith in me!
218
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,370
And yet, I…!
219
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,370
He’s…
220
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,820
He’s…like the old me…
221
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,450
No one will ever accept you!
Die Naruto!
222
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,080
Duck down, Naruto!
223
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,530
I’m…a worthless guy…
224
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,700
W-Why?
225
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,910
Because we are the same.
226
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
He’s like me of the old days.
227
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,080
I go around and around,
and get nowhere…
228
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,080
I can’t do anything right.
229
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,160
Aoi is right.
230
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,120
I have…no right to live--
231
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,490
You idiot!
232
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,870
There’s a person
who still trusts you, right?
233
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,910
I know, Naruto.
234
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,820
You felt alone…
and you were suffering!
235
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,820
One is enough!
236
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,490
The race isn’t over yet!
237
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,740
You never know how things will turn out
unless you try until the very end.
238
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,240
But…
239
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,820
Stand up now!
240
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,450
Naruto, it’s not possible!
ldate’s body is still…
241
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,030
If he can’t run,
then I’ll carry him on my back and run!
242
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,830
The opponent must already be
in Modoroki Shrine…
243
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,280
Don’t give up!
244
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,580
Hey… Naruto…
245
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,370
Sasuke…
246
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,620
Let’s leave it to Naruto here.
247
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,910
Jirocho is waiting for you, right?
248
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,820
Pull yourself together!
249
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,200
Boss, don’t you think
he actually ran away?
250
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,820
He’ll come.
251
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,830
I believe in Idate!
252
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,240
If you run away now,
you’ll be a loser for your entire life!
253
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,240
For the people who believe
in you and wait for you…
254
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,120
It’s the fastest boat around here.
255
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,450
I'm grateful.
256
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
No problem.
257
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,990
Edged tools aren’t
for hurting people…
258
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,820
Show them what you’ve got!
259
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,820
Naruto! Please take me there!
260
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,870
All right. Leave it to me!
261
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,820
Once in a long while, once in a while
262
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,530
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
263
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,820
Look like a mountain
264
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:53,950
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
265
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,700
The remnants of a person crying
266
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,740
Look like a mountain
267
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,410
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
268
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,240
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
269
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,580
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
270
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,820
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
271
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,910
Look like a mountain
272
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,160
Look like a mountain
273
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,820
Look like a mountain
274
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,950
Look like a mountain
275
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,160
Hey you!
276
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,990
What're you jabbering about,
lecturing like you're something else?!
277
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,820
You are so annoying!
278
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,820
Come on, Idate.
279
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,910
Boss Jirochi is waiting for you
at the finish line, right?
280
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,120
I don't care if this guy
is a Jonin or whatever.
281
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,910
I'm gonna beat him and make for
the finish line with all my might!
282
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,120
Next time:
"A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder!'
//%
1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,910
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,410
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,200
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,540
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,790
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:40,000
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,450
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,990
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,410
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,410
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,950
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,290
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:08,120
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,990
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,200
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,040
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,370
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,990
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,330
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Blaze Away, Byakugan!
This is My Ninja Way!!
21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,990
Kiba!
22
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,750
Naruto!
23
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,870
This isn’t good.
24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,990
Oh my, what’s wrong?
25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,000
So you’ll just stay there
and become larvae food?
26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,250
Queen Bee…
27
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,750
That kind of stuff shouldn’t
be effective, should it?!
28
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,410
Chakra…!
29
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,990
Byakugan!
30
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,000
It’s no good… There’s no way
I can make it in time!
31
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,990
Naruto…
32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,000
I don’t know when to give up!
33
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,160
That’s right…
34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,990
I know that Naruto would never give up,
no matter what the situation is!
35
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,750
Hey, did you catch them?
36
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,620
What a foolish group!
37
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,580
They made this creature mad…
38
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,990
And they all got bound in wax!
39
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,870
Bees make wax.
40
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,500
You’re an insect handler
and you don’t know that?
41
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,990
He’s right!
C’mon, are you really an insect handler?
42
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,160
What about the Bikochu?
43
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,410
Nothing.
44
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,200
We did an all-out mobilization
and searched,
45
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,620
but we haven’t found it.
46
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,990
Aren’t these guys carrying it?
47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,290
That’s unthinkable.
48
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,330
So that means…
49
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,370
So we’re going to have to
ask one of these guys, after all.
50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,580
Who’s gonna talk?!
51
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,790
We can tell you.
52
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,160
Shino!
53
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,950
However…
lt’s in exchange for Hinata.
54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,580
That’s stupid, isn’t it? To bargain…
55
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,950
Do you not understand your position?
56
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,500
You guys definitely will not
find the Bikochu.
57
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,990
And you’re pressed for time.
58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,450
You are the ones…who will regret it.
59
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,580
What should we do?
60
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,990
If things stay like this,
61
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,250
the Bikochu won’t be of any help
even if it hatches.
62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,700
In that case, our mission is also…
63
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,450
But…
64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,620
If we can get rid of even one
of the Aburame family…
65
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,950
Hinata…
66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,990
Are you worried?
67
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,990
Of course!
68
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,250
She’s strong.
69
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,200
Huh?
70
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,200
Much more…than you think.
71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,410
I concede. We have a deal.
72
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,870
First of all, we need our friend.
73
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,990
What happened?
74
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,990
The brat…isn’t here.
75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,990
The wax she was trapped in isn’t there.…
76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,950
She may have been swept out
to the waterfall.
77
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
Jibachi!
78
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,790
It can’t be helped! I warned her not
to make a bad move or she’d die.
79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,080
You!
80
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,950
What did you do to Hinata?!
81
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,080
What happened to Hinata! Hey!
82
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,040
Shut up, kid.
83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,990
The kid’s probably in
the depths of hell about now.
84
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,370
Damn you!
85
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,450
Aha, the girl’s your girlfriend?
86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,040
You…! I absolutely will not forgive you!
87
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,700
You’re kidding me.
What can you do looking like that?
88
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,250
Without Hinata you’ll never get
your hands on the Bikochu either.
89
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,950
You are right…
90
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,370
That girl’s death was not part
of the plan,
91
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,330
but in the end, it’s a good thing.
92
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,700
Because…we’ll take your lives in return.
93
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,620
From the very beginning, people from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves and
94
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,580
from my own Village Hidden in the Stones
have been sworn enemies.
95
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,990
It’s natural that we kill
each other, isn’t it?
96
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,950
What're ya gonna do, little guy?
97
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,830
Die like this?
98
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,540
Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is,
I could save you for now.
99
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,000
– All right.
– Don’t you dare tell them!
100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,580
Those jerks,
I’m going to blow them away!
101
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,040
Shut up, brat!
102
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,200
– Jibachi? 					– Hey!
103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,990
Shut up, I’ve got to kill him!
104
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,620
It’s a Paper Bomb!
105
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,990
You’re…!
106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Y-You’re…!
107
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,080
…still alive!
108
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,290
That was really close.
But I didn’t give up, just like Naruto…
109
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,120
Did she escape from the wax?
lt can’t be!
110
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,660
These are not ordinary kids.
111
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,370
Leave it to me!
112
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,250
Hinata!
113
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,990
I’ve never used that in an actual fight…
114
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,290
But I have to do it here, now!
115
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,410
Bee Bombs Jutsu!
116
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,120
1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
117
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,370
Bee Swarm Jutsu!
118
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,660
Naruto…
119
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,080
Naruto… Watch me.
120
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,540
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!
121
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,660
– What?! 					– What?!
122
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,080
You’re kidding, right?
123
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,830
That Hinata can do
such an amazing Jutsu?
124
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,990
The Hinata that you know, Naruto,
is from when?
125
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,950
What do you mean?
126
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,700
You’ve learned new Jutsu
since the Chunin Ninja Exam, haven’t you?
127
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,830
Hinata has been steadily developing, too.
128
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,990
She always has been concerned…
129
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,950
Take aim.
130
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,620
That’s nice, the three of you,
131
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,250
all have something you’re good at
and something you like.
132
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,660
Hinata, you should find something, too…
133
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,200
You’re right.
134
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,290
By the way, what is it?
135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,500
You had some business with me,
didn’t you?
136
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,200
Yeah…
137
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,250
I want you to join me
in my training.
138
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,580
Hinata was fretting over
what she could do…
139
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,990
What she should do…
140
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,120
Hinata!
141
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,990
Hey, I don’t think that we should…
142
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,500
No… Don’t go easy on me!
143
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,500
If you’re doing it for me…
144
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,080
Do it seriously!
145
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,990
I’ve got it!
146
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,700
During the harsh training,
147
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,580
Hinata discovered her own styles…
and her own special Jutsu.
148
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,330
That’s the result of her training.
149
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,080
Huh? You, why!?
150
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,330
I’ll tell you something…
151
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,290
Angering the Queen Bee,
getting encased in wax,
152
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,250
it was all part of the strategy.
153
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,700
With our Chakra being sucked
and being immobilized,
154
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,750
it was the only way to protect ourselves
from the larvae…
155
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,500
And, do you think I was doing nothing
while I was captured?
156
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,500
I was ordering my bugs.
The wax we’re wrapped in is very weak.
157
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,660
Shino!
158
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,410
Because of her hard training,
159
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,080
Hinata’s Chakra control
has dramatically improved.
160
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,620
That Jutsu is what she developed
from the training…
161
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,080
Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms!
162
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,910
Hinata’s already flexible body combined
with fine-tuned Chakra control
163
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,620
could completely defend
an attack from every direction…
164
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,450
Truly, it’s an ultimate defense Jutsu.
165
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,700
Yet it’s different from
Neji’s 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.
166
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,250
It’s Hinata’s own Jutsu…
167
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,700
She finally worked that out on her own.
168
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,450
She probably did it because she wanted
to be acknowledged by her father.
169
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,950
To be acknowledged by everyone…
170
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,160
And to be acknowledged by you.
171
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,370
Our Jutsu isn’t effective at all?!
172
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,080
What the hell is going on?
173
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,990
What a girl!
174
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,870
Hey, what happened to those guys?!
175
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,200
When did they?!
176
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,660
Summoning Jutsu!
177
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,990
Blow them away!
178
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,080
Hinata!
179
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,000
Shino!
180
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,990
Believe…in her.
181
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,700
Make the Chakra…
182
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,790
sharper, stronger…
183
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,580
bigger, more flexible…
184
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:14,160
more…more…more…
more…more…more…more!
185
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,250
Hinata!
186
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,910
Hinata!
187
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,540
Naruto…
188
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,660
Hinata, that’s an awesome Jutsu!
You’re really awesome!
189
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,790
Naruto…!
190
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,000
Let’s hurry. It’ll be dawn soon.
191
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,500
– Okay! 					– Yeah!
192
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,870
Oh, it’s becoming a pupa already?
193
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,580
If we make it smell Sasuke’s scent
at the moment it hatches,
194
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,160
the mission is complete.
195
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,370
Right!
196
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,620
Sasuke… Wait for me!
197
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,790
No way!
198
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,750
Inside the tree, huh.
199
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,830
If it was there,
the bees should have found it…
200
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,540
You can still move?
201
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,990
This insect cage was coated
with secret Aburame family insect repellent.
202
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,910
Wh-What?
203
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,990
The bees won’t come close
because of the repellent.
204
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,200
As long as you’re using bees to search…
you definitely won’t find it.
205
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,660
I expected as much.
206
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,200
I think as long as your clan exists…
207
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,410
my clan maybe destined to
be ruined some day.
208
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,990
But!
209
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,540
I absolutely will not let you
succeed at your mission!
210
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,990
Even if it kills me, that Bikochu…
211
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
212
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,990
This is our hope…
in order to get our friend back!
213
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,410
I won’t let you do that!
214
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,990
Shut up!
215
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,750
Rasengan!
216
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,910
Hey, look…
217
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,750
The pupa is hatching!
218
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,040
Okay!
219
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,950
Huh? It's gone!
220
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,700
You had it ‘til just a minute ago!
221
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,660
Hey, search for it, hurry!
222
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,540
R-Right…
223
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Byakugan!
224
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,990
Naruto! Over there.
225
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,910
You blew it away the instant you set off
the Rasengan!
226
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,660
Hurry!
227
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,160
I know!
228
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,120
C’mon, c’mon.
229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It’s going to hatch!
230
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,790
We did it! Hurry, make it sniff this…
231
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,830
Wh-Why…?!
232
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,750
That thing just now doesn’t count!
C’mon, sniff Sasuke’s smell!
233
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,870
It’s all over now.
234
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,580
Huh…?
235
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,080
Hey! Stop! Wait!
236
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,500
So you failed because you farted!
237
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,200
Take responsibility!
238
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,990
What are you saying that for?!
239
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,620
Well then…
240
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,580
That’s…the Bikochu, isn’t it?
241
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,830
Naruto… I found you!
242
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,910
C’mon, forgive me already, Sakura!
243
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,290
No! I absolutely will not forgive you!
244
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,990
– Sakura, you look so scary!
– Come back here!
245
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
So the mission failed…
246
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,950
It seems that they succeeded
at protecting the Bikochu,
247
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,990
but failed at getting it to smell
the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.
248
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,870
I see… Hinata must be depressed.
249
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,330
This strategy was her idea, wasn’t it?
250
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,990
Well… Looks like that’s not the case.
251
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,000
Hinata… I heard that your mission failed.
252
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,990
Yes. It didn’t work at all.
253
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,700
I have to train more and more…
and work harder next time!
254
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,870
I-I see… Good luck.
255
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,500
More…
256
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,660
More…
257
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,790
More…
258
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
More!
259
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,540
Crappy news pass us by
260
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,990
And you become speechless
261
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,990
My voice is way too soft
262
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,160
So you don’t answer
263
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,990
You’re crying   Crying alone
264
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,870
What can I do?   I’m crying too
265
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,330
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
266
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:07,580
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
267
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:17,080
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
268
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:26,290
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
269
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:38,040
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
270
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,990
What! Why do I have to go on
such an easy mission?!
271
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,830
Don’t complain! You’re the one
who picked up this mission’s client!
272
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,250
That’s no reason!
After all, I’m busy with a lot stuff!
273
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,250
That’s enough,
or I’ll send you back to the Academy!
274
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,330
That’s not fair…
275
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,540
No arguments!
Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto!
276
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,990
The four of you,
I’m delivering your new mission.
277
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,410
Next episode:
“Funeral March for the Living”
//%
1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:13,930
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,610
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,300
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,900
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,960
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,230
Our two hearts
11
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,520
This is as far as you go.
Give Matsuri back.
12
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,560
You think you’ve got me cornered now?
13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,570
Don’t get the wrong idea.
You’re the one who’s been cornered!
14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,570
What?
15
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,940
Byakugan!
16
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,640
He has the final enemy cornered
in a dead-end valley.
17
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,810
The area around the valley
is eerily calm.
18
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,150
I don’t see his comrades.
19
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,090
Is Shikamaru’s final move finished?
20
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,860
No.
21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,060
We can’t state definitively that
they’ve reached a deadlock.
22
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,130
It’s because it’s possible that
the battles thus far were diversions.
23
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,840
Just a little more, Lee.
24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,640
It’ll be over once I connect
two or three more muscles.
25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,050
Sakura’s Medical Ninja technique
is really becoming…
26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,650
And yet I…
27
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,560
The treatment is over for now.
How do you fight to get like this?
28
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,060
I’m sorry.
29
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,100
You saved me.
Thank you, Sakura.
30
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,930
You’re welcome.
31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,300
Oh, you can’t, yet.
32
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,810
As one of the Medical Team members,
I prohibit you from fighting any further.
33
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,010
No, please let me go.
34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,550
I can’t just leave Gaara like this…
35
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,550
We’re Team Return-the-Favor, after all.
36
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,560
The Ultimate Weapon Reborn
37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Gaara, you may very well be
called the ultimate weapon,
38
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,260
but have you not used up all of
your sand in the fight earlier?
39
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,800
This is my weapon.
40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,540
Indeed I have used up almost all
of the sand with Chakra built up inside.
41
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,110
But…
42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,480
No matter what Jutsu you use,
I must not lose in a one-on-one battle.
43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,520
There’s nothing scary about
a Shinobi with no weapon!
44
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,560
Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!
45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,840
Fang Release: Dark Sword!
Flying Double Edge Sword!
46
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,020
You’ll realize that the likes
of a mere Ninja
47
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,560
is no match for the Ninja tools
created by us artisans.
48
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,710
Fang Release: Dark Sword!
49
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,920
It seems your own body’s Chakra
has run out.
50
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,820
You’re carrying
a monster inside you, right?
51
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,300
Now, isn’t it about time
you used the power of Shukaku?
52
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,020
You okay?
53
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,550
Gaara Sensei is…
54
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,650
Yeah, I know.
55
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,060
Listen up.
You hide in a safe place somewhere.
56
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,090
Right.
57
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,200
Although Gaara received
Sakura’s treatment, he's still…
58
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,770
That’s as far as you go,
ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!
59
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,580
Damn it.
60
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,510
Use the power of the Shukaku already.
61
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,550
Hey!
62
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Hold it!
63
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,020
Who are you?
64
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,820
I’ll be your opponent from here on.
65
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,760
You’re in the way, boy.
66
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,230
Kujaku Hurricane!
67
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,400
Damn it!
68
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,600
Leaf Shinobi, you watch.
69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,710
The era of control by
the Five Great Nations will end.
70
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,610
No, it won’t be just that.
71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,650
If the ultimate Ninja tool created by
the Artisan Village is completed,
72
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,020
the existence of the Ninja
will no longer be necessary.
73
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,550
What’re you talking about?!
74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,820
We are people from the Village
of Artisans who for many years
75
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,560
have equally shared
exceptional Ninja tools
76
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,560
with you in the Five Great Nations.
77
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,130
However, each time relations
worsened between fellow villages,
78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,170
the Village of Artisans would be attacked
79
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,840
over fear of Ninja tools crossing
over to the other village.
80
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,140
You Ninja of the Five Great Nations
have forgotten
81
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,980
that you are kept alive by our power,
82
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,340
and have returned the favor
with vengeance time and again.
83
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,850
Although we the people of
the Village of Artisans have advanced skills,
84
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,320
we have had to survive by currying favor
from the Five Great Nations!
85
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,160
However, that era will now end!
86
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,760
First, I will take out the Leaf Village.
87
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,830
Fang Release Dark Sword!
88
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,570
How long can you run away for?
89
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,180
I’ll stake you like a shrike!
90
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,320
What?!
91
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,560
You!
92
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,390
Gaara Sensei!
93
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Gaara Sensei’s sand
protected the Leaf Ninja.
94
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,900
That dome created with hard minerals
in the ground mixed with sand…
95
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,540
can’t be smashed by such junk.
96
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,310
I’ll protect him until the end…
97
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,750
with my power!
98
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,180
Gaara Sensei!
99
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,250
Don’t make me laugh!
100
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,420
You, who are called the greatest creation
of the Sand, a terrifying weapon,
101
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,160
are going to protect someone else?
102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,630
And you’re going to use
what little Chakra you have left
103
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,290
for the sake of a comrade?
104
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,370
But that will be your death!
105
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,540
Gaara Sensei!
106
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,880
With this,
all preparations are complete.
107
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,650
Damn it.
108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,750
Oh!
109
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,930
Gaara!
110
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,930
We were contacted by someone
from the Village of Artisans.
111
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,500
It seems ones calling themselves
the Four Celestials,
112
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
bearing long-withstanding hostilities
against the Five Great Nations…
113
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,840
have completed forbidden research and
are attempting to resurrect
114
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,780
the ultimate weapon of folklore
in the village.
115
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,350
It seems the villagers got
wind of the crisis
116
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,420
and have evacuated to
a different location.
117
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,250
I see. So that’s why the village
was completely empty.
118
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,220
So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?
119
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
The resurrection of Seimei,
the founder of the Village of Artisans.
120
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,230
Seimei?!
121
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,570
Are you saying
they’re trying to raise the dead?!
122
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,540
I see. It makes sense that
the mausoleum was violated.
123
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,970
As for us, we must prevent
the resurrection
124
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,780
of the ultimate weapon at all costs.
125
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,140
I understand. I’ll be off.
126
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,550
Oh, hold on.
127
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,750
Yes?
128
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,850
I’ll be having one more person
accompany you on this mission.
129
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,820
What? Who would that be?
130
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
What we wanted was
the Shukaku’s Chakra.
131
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,100
What did you say?
132
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,730
How we’ve waited for this time.
133
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,540
Now Gaara, turn into the Shukaku now.
134
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,410
And infuse me with that power.
135
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,110
Gaara!
136
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,540
I’ll save you now.
137
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,740
Naruto!
138
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,380
Matsuri, take this.
139
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
My rope javelin.
140
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,800
The optic nerves have connected…
141
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,340
Open…
142
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,670
third eye!
143
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,310
Hey, you.
144
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,750
What the heck do you intend to start?
145
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,550
I’ll show you.
146
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,550
The ultimate Ninja tool created
by Lord Seimei,
147
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,090
the founder of our Village of Artisans.
148
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,460
Ultimate Ninja tool?
149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,200
Now is the time of its completion.
150
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,550
Gaara!
151
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,500
Oh, Lord Seimei.
152
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,840
Please take possession of my flesh
and complete your resurrection!
153
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,550
Oh!
154
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,500
What’s going on? He vanished.
155
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,980
The dead body came back to life!
156
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,560
My name is Seimei.
The founder of the Village of Artisans.
157
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,560
A hundred years have passed and
158
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,130
I have now been resurrected
as the ultimate Ninja tool
159
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,560
of the Village of Artisans!
160
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,680
What in the world is happening here?!
161
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,690
My long-awaited wish has at last
come to fruition.
162
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,560
With this, my Village of Artisans will reign
over the Shinobi apex.
163
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
I see…
164
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,840
So the monster from the Sand Village
became the source of my power.
165
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,640
Say what?
166
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,010
Hoko said this.
167
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,310
There is a monster lying
within the body
168
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,550
of the one called Gaara
from the Sand Village.
169
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,650
Once that person is in a cage,
170
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,920
soon he will become
a complete monster, the Shukaku.
171
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,520
I will take away what you could
consider infinite Chakra from the Shukaku.
172
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,560
I won’t let you do that!
173
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,460
Damn it!
174
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,930
Just wait, Gaara.
I’ll get you out now.
175
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,770
What a waste…
176
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,440
Vortex Wind.
177
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,310
I’m just getting started!
178
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,420
What a fool!
179
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,030
I’ll get you out now!
180
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,360
Damn it, damn it!
181
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,470
Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!
182
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,670
Gaara, answer me!
What’s going on in there?!
183
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,270
Gaara!
184
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,540
Gaara!
185
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,250
N-Naruto…
186
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,440
Shikamaru!
187
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,540
What?
188
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,310
Where are Gaara and Naruto?
189
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,110
Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.
190
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,150
There’s a cage behind an area
surrounded by rocks…
191
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,020
There’s a massive amount of Chakra
being extracted from there.
192
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,150
Gaara must be inside.
193
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,020
Hey, Shikamaru!
194
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,090
What?
195
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,560
You know there’s a terrifying power
lying dormant inside Gaara, right?
196
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,800
Yeah, generally.
197
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,930
Something terrible will happen…
198
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,610
if Gaara has Chakra extracted like this
and he loses himself!
199
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,680
The Shukaku that had been kept
under control will go out of control.
200
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,350
Once it starts going berserk,
there will be no way to stop Gaara.
201
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,850
For real?
202
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,990
I must not waste any more time.
203
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,050
The entertainment ends here.
204
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,560
Hot-hot-hot-hot.
205
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,370
Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!
206
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,630
I’ll get you out now!
207
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,900
You’re a pest!
208
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,640
Give it up already!
209
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,180
I’m just getting started!
210
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,520
Solid Blanks!
211
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,810
Oh, how I have waited for this time.
212
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,680
Now, Shukaku! Give me power!
213
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,260
I feel it. This is an amazing power!
214
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,560
Cut out the futile resistance.
215
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,460
The power of the Shukaku
is already mine!
216
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,630
I declare war on the Five Great Nations.
217
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,770
The Shinobi in the Five Great Nations
who made light of the Artisan Shinobi
218
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,840
will fully realize the 100-year grudge
of the Artisan Ninja.
219
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,880
And they will inevitably
become our sacrifices.
220
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,310
Knock it off!
221
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,140
What?!
222
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,020
We won’t hand over our power
to the likes of you.
223
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,890
I won’t let you take away any more
of Gaara’s Chakra.
224
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,090
You got that?!
225
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,000
How can that person fight
while getting that beaten up?
226
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,970
Why do you go this far, kid?
227
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,510
What is the monster of
the Sand Village to you?
228
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,010
Gaara…
229
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,380
Gaara is an important comrade to me!
230
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,320
He said he fights for
those important to him.
231
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,420
Fights for someone important.
232
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,530
Very well. Then die!
233
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,910
What’re you doing, little girl?
234
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,440
I finally figured out what
Gaara Sensei taught me.
235
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,550
Weapons took away the lives
of my mother and father.
236
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,880
But I can also protect those important
to me with a weapon!
237
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,550
Foolishness.
238
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,360
Damn it!
239
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,840
It has finally begun, huh…?
240
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,190
Gaara Sensei…
241
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,800
Gaara!
242
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,680
Gaara.
243
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,360
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
244
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:29,570
Will always be smiling right near by
245
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,510
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
246
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,010
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
247
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,920
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
248
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,760
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
249
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,730
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
250
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,100
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
251
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
252
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,940
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
253
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,820
The wind is probably testing our hearts
254
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,150
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
255
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,330
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
256
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,130
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
257
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,770
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
258
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,940
Will always be smiling right near by
259
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,120
Hey, that’s…
260
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,550
– We were too late.
– Then, you mean…
261
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,550
Yes. He is starting to transform
to Shukaku.
262
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,150
Damn! What should we do?
263
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,520
This is bad.
lf Gaara loses his conscious in that state,
264
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,330
the true Shukaku will come out.
265
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,500
When that happens
he won’t know a foe from friend,
266
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
he will just destroy everything.
267
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,770
All we can do is just stand here
and watch?!
268
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,170
Next time: “Departure”
//%
1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,940
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,850
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,150
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,310
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,480
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,020
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,900
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:05,020
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:12,190
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,890
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:28,890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,520
Byakugan!
13
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,810
Caught ’em!
14
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,560
All right! All right!
I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!
15
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,890
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
16
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,150
but I’m gonna demonstrate
my new Jutsu right here!
17
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,270
Me, too!
18
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,690
Don’t be so hasty.
19
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,980
As soon as preparations have been made
to implement my strategy…
20
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,270
we’ll make direct contact
with the target!
21
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,560
It looks like they haven’t
noticed us yet.
22
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,890
Huh? Sasuke isn’t there.
23
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,440
It appears that…
24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,060
he’s inside that “coffin.”
25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,890
What’s this?
26
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,770
I poked the bush for kicks
27
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,350
and out comes not even a snake,
but just two bugs.
28
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,270
Hey, wait a minute! Wait!
29
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,650
We didn’t come here to fight.
30
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,730
We just came here to negotiate!
31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,480
Huh, then…
32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,190
What are they?!
33
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,890
There’s no point
to that Smoke Bomb.
34
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,350
You can’t run away from me.
35
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,100
It’s string that's thinner and stronger
than wire that you can hardly see.
36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,060
My string is placed all over this place.
37
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,890
Darn.
38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,270
Those two types of wires
on the trap were on purpose…
39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,980
It was actually a triple trap.
40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,690
Darn.
41
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,600
Didn’t think they had one
with such ability in the group…
42
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,650
You will be…!
43
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,730
What’s going on...? My body…
44
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,890
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
45
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,400
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
46
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,940
But… There is one with
ability like this, too.
47
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,400
Thanks for getting caught so nicely
in my strategy.
48
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,060
Darn… But...
49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,810
I have this kind of ability, too.
50
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,100
Where did it come from?
51
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,020
Earth Style Barrier!
52
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,650
Earth Dome Prison!
53
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,810
Squad Mutiny: Everything Falls Apart!
54
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,270
Darn!
55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,310
Where is this?
56
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,650
Inside of that big guy’s barrier.
57
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,850
Darn!
58
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,520
These guys are mine.
I want to recover as much as possible.
59
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,900
Once you’re done eating,
catch up with us,
60
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,480
we’re going ahead.
61
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,270
Come quickly.
62
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,060
Let us out! You!
63
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,020
Be quiet, Naruto!
64
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,150
From the looks of it,
it just looks like a dirt wall…
65
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,650
It’s their Jutsu,
there must be some kind of trap.
66
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,690
I don’t know what it’s made of,
67
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,890
but we’re just going to
have to tear this wall down!
68
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,940
Even though
it’s dangerous to be careless,
69
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,310
actually it’s more dangerous
to remain silent here.
70
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Tunneling Fang!
71
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,890
The wall is restoring itself…
72
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,600
Hey…
73
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,890
I saw that.
74
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,650
Let us out!
75
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,650
It’s not just a dirt wall, after all.
76
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,890
Byakugan!
77
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,890
Th-This is…
78
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,560
What is it ? What’s happening?
79
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,190
This is bad.
Chakra’s getting sucked up…
80
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,520
Darn… I didn’t expect that
they would just keep us in the barrier,
81
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,850
but I didn’t predict that
they would suck our Chakra either.
82
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,190
Man. How dare they!
Let us out of here already!
83
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,730
I’ve had a good amount of Chakra.
Thank you for the meal.
84
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,730
I feel like my body energy
is being sucked out.
85
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,400
It won’t be good if
we stay like this here, Shikamaru.
86
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,810
It was careless to get caught
87
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,850
before we even figured out
our enemy’s powers.
88
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,350
On top of all that…inside here.
89
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,100
Darn! I’m going to make an air hole
before all my Chakra is gone!
90
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,480
Akamaru!
91
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,940
The Food Pills!
92
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,890
Akamaru!
Human Mimicry Ninja Art!
93
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,890
And for me,
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!
94
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,230
Fang Over Fang!
95
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,310
All right! Good going, Kiba.
96
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,060
It’s useless…
97
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,520
Darn! It starts to restore
the moment it’s hit.
98
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,890
Same with the ground.
99
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,850
At this rate, we won’t be able to
keep up for another ten minutes.
100
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,730
We’ll lose all our Chakra
and be totally annihilated…
101
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,900
I can’t use the Rasengan that
requires extremely difficult Chakra control
102
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,890
especially in a place like this
that sucks the Chakra out of us.
103
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,400
Darn!
104
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,060
Hey, I want you to listen to me!
I want to talk to your leader.
105
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,480
We won’t go after Sasuke anymore,
so let us out of here!
106
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,560
Hey…
107
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,400
Shikamaru, what are you saying?
108
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,770
Pleading for your life,
how interesting…
109
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,650
But you guys are my prey,
I can’t let you out.
110
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,600
Then…just let me out on my own.
111
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,100
This battle…
112
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,890
is such a pain.
113
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,890
You! Do you know
what you’re saying?
114
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,890
Shut up, Kiba, be quiet…
115
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,440
What?!
116
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,100
A split in the group, huh?
117
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,890
Seems like you’re the leader, but…
118
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,150
I didn’t think you would be
the only one begging for your life!
119
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,900
You really see a human’s true nature
when one is pushed to the edge of death.
120
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
You’re such a low-life creature,
121
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,890
you’re not qualified to be responsible
for the lives of your platoon members.
122
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,060
I’ve saved the most
important thing for last…
123
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,060
To abandon Sasuke and
to even sell out on your own platoon…
124
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,440
Is that what it means
to be a Chunin of the Leaf?
125
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,560
Sasuke is a Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
126
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,890
He is a comrade!
127
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,600
Therefore, I will put my life on the line
to help him!
128
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,560
That's the way of the Leaf Village.
129
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,100
Someone like you deserves to die…
I won’t let you out.
130
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,520
Shikamaru! I believed in you,
but now I’ve lost confidence in you!
131
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,850
Let’s take this outside!
132
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,600
Hey, we can’t get out!
You fool!
133
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,600
That’s why we’re in this situation!
134
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,230
What do you mean by "fool"?
135
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,520
I’m just speaking the truth, fool!
136
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,980
Oh! You said "fool" again!
137
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,850
Everybody, be quiet for a second!
138
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,150
Choji?
139
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,890
Now he’s squatting down.
What is he thinking?
140
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,890
Hey! Why are you eating snacks
all of a sudden?!
141
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,890
Choji binge eats when he gets upset…
142
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,890
Geez, another useless guy.
143
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,890
It can’t be helped!
ln this case, Shadow Clone…!
144
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,890
Stop it.
145
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,900
The enemy’s Chakra is placed
all over that wall.
146
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Even if you are able to scratch it,
the wall will restore itself right away.
147
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,900
In other words, it’s useless
unless we can attack it
148
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,190
with a Taijutsu that has enough power
to destroy this wall with one blow.
149
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,890
Somebody that has a Taijutsu
with greater destructive power than mine
150
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,190
would be Choji, but…
151
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,770
At this rate…
152
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,890
Darn, what do we do!
153
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,440
Neji… I’m sorry, but can you use
the rest of the Chakra you have
154
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,890
to observe the wall behind you
and the wall behind Choji?
155
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,440
I got it.
156
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,900
Shikamaru! You be quiet!
157
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,890
Naruto!
158
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,650
You still don’t understand?!
159
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,060
Remember what Shikamaru said
when he gathered everyone!
160
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,440
Even I can't just sit back
and be a sluggard.
161
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,270
Because I'm responsible
for your lives.
162
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,810
Choji, don’t raise your voice
too much from here.
163
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,650
Kiba, dent that wall
behind Neji and Choji again!
164
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,520
Y-Yeah…
165
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,890
Huh! I don’t fully understand
what’s going on,
166
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,230
but I’ll go wild one more time!
167
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,730
Tunneling Fang!
168
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,810
Huh! No matter how hard you try,
it’s useless!
169
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,980
Huh, I see…
170
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,310
It’s over there.
171
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,480
Neji!
172
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,890
Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife.
173
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,850
Choji, are you ready?!
174
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,400
Okay! Any time!
175
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,890
All right, let’s do this.
176
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,060
What’s happening?!
177
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,520
Like I said earlier,
the wall’s surface is planted with Chakra.
178
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,730
But even this tough wall could have
an area that have a thin layer of Chakra.
179
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,020
That is what Shikamaru speculated.
180
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,600
How…How did you get all of that?
181
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,440
Think about what happened earlier.
182
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,890
Because he noticed that
there were areas that restored quickly
183
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,890
and others that didn’t so quickly
184
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,900
when Kiba and Akamaru attacked
the wall surface.
185
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,310
In other words, he guessed that
those areas that didn’t restore quickly
186
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,900
probably has a thin layer
of Chakra.
187
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,890
On top of all that,
by cleverly talking to the enemy,
188
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,900
he figured out the position
of the enemy outside of the wall.
189
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,100
He guessed that
the wall furthest from the enemy
190
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,730
probably had the thinnest point
of Chakra,
191
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,150
so that’s what he wanted to confirm.
192
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,190
That’s what it is, correct?
193
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,890
I see, in order to trick the enemy,
you must trick your friends first.
194
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,890
I didn’t see that there was
such a plan behind that conversation.
195
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,230
Then, Choji realized the plan
196
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,600
and the reason why he was eating
was to replenish his Chakra.
197
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,650
These two…
198
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,650
They haven’t been working together
as a team all these years for nothing.
199
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,890
I’m depending on you, Choji.
200
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,730
Yeah!
201
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,890
Expansion Jutsu!
202
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,060
All right, let’s go!
203
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,690
Human Boulder!
204
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,940
What?!
205
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,940
Choji… You are awesome, after all!
206
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:32,230
Once in a long while, once in a while
207
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,890
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
208
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,150
Look like a mountain
209
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,520
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
210
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,020
The remnants of a person crying
211
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,060
Look like a mountain
212
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,890
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
213
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,810
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
214
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,900
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
215
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,150
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
216
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,480
Look like a mountain
217
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,730
Look like a mountain
218
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,230
Look like a mountain
219
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Look like a mountain
220
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,850
Huh? What are you saying
all of a sudden, Choji!
221
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,690
There’s no way that’s possible!
222
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,100
But, Choji is right.
223
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,350
If we keep lagging, we won’t be able
to catch up with Sasuke.
224
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,310
But still…
225
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,270
Don’t worry. I have an idea.
226
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,690
Choji, are you possibly thinking…
227
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,230
Do you have a plan or something?
228
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,850
Yeah.
229
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,690
Hey! Choji!
230
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,890
That’s right!
I have that secret weapon of mine!
231
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,480
Next time:
“Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!”
232
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,270
I’m the one who will defeat that guy!
//%
1
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,830
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,330
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,120
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,450
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,700
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,990
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,370
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,990
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,330
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,330
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,870
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,200
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,040
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,870
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,120
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,990
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,290
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,950
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,250
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,950
A Lesson Learned!
The Iron Fist of Love
21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,290
Please don’t die…
I’ll get you out now.
22
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,870
Hey!
23
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,990
What are you doing there?
24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,080
Curry of Life Shop
25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,120
One, two… 					One, two…
26
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,410
Hope they’re all right.
27
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,990
I’m sure they’ll be able
to bring Karashi back.
28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,990
Definitely, Definitely.
29
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,870
One, two…
30
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,540
That’s the Katabami Gold Mine…
31
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,990
Instead of just getting
Rokusuke and Karashi back,
32
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,040
let’s finish the Kurosuki Family
once and for all!
33
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,700
Don’t get carried away, Naruto.
34
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,160
So, what are we gonna do then?
35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,750
I’m kind of worried about
what Guy Sensei told us.
36
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,990
The boss of the Kurosuki Family
may be
37
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,660
one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist.
38
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,450
Who knows what
they’ll do to Rokusuke?
39
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,370
Yeah, but how seriously
can we take Guy Sensei’s info?
40
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,990
What are you talking about?!
Guy Sensei is always right!
41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Calm down, Lee.
We should investigate first.
42
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,580
Yeah!
43
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,410
Sir Raiga, we were able
to capture Rokusuke,
44
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,580
one of the three that
slipped out of the village.
45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,990
Well done.
46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,620
It seems that they went to ask
for some help from a Ninja village.
47
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,620
Where did you go?!
48
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,540
I’m sorry.
49
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,200
Don’t bother, rookie.
50
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,040
Yes sir!
51
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,790
Rokusuke, I thought we had
a good relationship
52
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,000
with everybody in the Gold Mine.
53
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,950
Well, that’s…
54
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,990
Why is it? I’m so deeply sorry
to hear that you left the village.
55
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,540
I can’t remember how things
were in the past,
56
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,040
when everything was going well.
57
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,990
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
I won’t do it again!
58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,870
Yeah, I have a good idea.
59
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,870
I’m going to arrange
for your funeral.
60
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,120
Please don’t! Please let me go!
61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,950
I won’t do it again,
so please forgive me!
62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,660
Why? Don’t you like funerals?
63
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,990
No, I don’t wanna die yet!
64
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,620
You know, I really like funerals…
65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,580
Think about it.
66
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,120
When they are alive, humans speak ill
of each other,
67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,700
they betray each other,
and they hate each other.
68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,000
But at a funeral,
69
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,790
they forget all the hatred
they had for the other.
70
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,120
They even remember
the good times they had together.
71
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Right?
72
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,000
You have to be kidding me!
No! Please don’t do it.
73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,790
Hey!
74
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,290
Let me go!
75
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,540
It’s a done deal then.
Let’s have a big funeral for Rokusuke.
76
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,990
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
77
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,080
Come on!
78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,700
Hurry up!
79
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,540
Is that gold?
There’s nothing shiny about it.
80
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,990
They have to melt
that ore into mercury.
81
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,990
After that they evaporate it
and only then does it turn into pure gold.
82
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,990
I don’t get it.
83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,990
Well, there is no need
for you to understand it.
84
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,080
Oh!
85
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,290
Huh? What are you doing?!
Hurry up!
86
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,950
If you don’t hurry up,
87
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,410
I’m gonna ask the boss
to let me hold your funeral!
88
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,830
Please forgive me!
89
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,990
I’m getting really mad now.
I won't forgive them!
90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,450
Calm down, Naruto…
91
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,950
We don’t know anything
about them yet.
92
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,580
That’s right. We should do
what Neji is telling us.
93
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,950
Yeah but…
94
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,580
if we don’t do something,
that poor old guy is going to die!
95
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,790
Naruto, leave things to me here.
96
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,290
Wait, Lee!
97
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,120
Hey, hey.
Hurry up and pick them up!
98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,410
Yeah! Way to go, Lee!
99
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,990
Are you okay, old man?
100
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,950
Oh my gosh!
What have you done?!
101
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,410
Here. Drink some water.
102
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,660
What are you doing?!
103
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,790
I beg you.
Please punch me, kick me.
104
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,080
Please knock me around
105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,620
like the way you just did
with those guys.
106
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,540
What are you saying?
107
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,450
If you won’t do it,
I’ll do it myself!
108
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you doing?!
109
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,450
Stop!
110
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,120
I’m scared.
111
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Just think what they’ll do
112
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,990
if they knew I was
the only one that was safe.
113
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,450
What was that sound?
114
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,000
Did they find us?
115
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,580
Oh my, that’s the sound
of the funeral bell.
116
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Funeral?
117
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,450
Yeah.
118
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,660
Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki family
which rules this town,
119
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,040
arranges a funeral for
those who betray him.
120
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,450
He buries them alive.
121
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,790
What? They bury them alive?
That’s so cruel!
122
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,120
Yeah but…
123
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,830
Raiga always cries sadly
during the funeral.
124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,790
That’s one weird guy.
125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
But…
126
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,990
That doesn’t seem to be
the sound of the bell for you.
127
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,910
Yeah, I heard that Rokusuke
was caught this morning, so…
128
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,910
What?!
129
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:04,080
I’m so happy, I remember
the first day I met that guy.
130
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,120
Yeah? That’s nice.
131
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeah… When I told him we were taking
over the mountain from the magistrate,
132
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,000
he was so relieved to be freed from
the high taxes that he was paying.
133
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,830
He was laughing out of pure joy…
He was a really nice guy.
134
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,250
I like funerals.
Makes me feel nostalgic.
135
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,990
Would you put on
a big funeral for me too?
136
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,330
Fool! I’m not putting on
a funeral for you.
137
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,200
You are not going
to die before me.
138
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,830
I don’t have to have a funeral for you
to think of the good times
139
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,700
because you are always a good boy.
140
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,540
Raiga.
141
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,040
What is it?
142
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,660
They're coming.
They’ll show up anytime now.
143
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,250
Yeah… I’m excited to see
what kind of help he sought.
144
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,990
Okay! Let’s save the guy.
145
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,330
Let’s do it, Neji.
146
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,450
Okay.
147
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,250
Byakugan!
148
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,990
It’s all right. He’s still alive.
149
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,580
If we can get rid of
the guys around him,
150
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,990
we can save him.
151
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,990
Okay! Let’s get rid
of them quickly!
152
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,990
Yeah!
153
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,790
Okay, let’s go!
154
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,910
No…! Let me out!
155
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,870
An enemy attack!
156
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,120
You…!
157
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,790
Tenten, you take the right!
158
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,870
Okay!
159
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,990
Gentle Fist!
160
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,750
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
161
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,700
Na-ru-to…
162
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,990
Uzumaki Barrage!
163
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,990
That’s the way!
164
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,410
– Watch out! 					– Huh?
165
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,990
There are three more!
166
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,120
Here comes the Leaf Village's
Handsome Devil, Rock Lee!
167
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,990
I found the last one!
168
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,950
You are…
169
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,160
Who is this guy?
170
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,250
Well…
171
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,080
This is Karashi.
172
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,700
The one Grandma Sansho
was talking about…
173
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,120
This is Karashi?
174
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,330
Karashi, was it your own decision
to join the Kurosuki Family…
175
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,870
just like Grandma Sansho said it was?
176
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
So what if it was?
177
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,660
What?!
178
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,410
Sir Raiga is great!
179
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,370
He dethroned the old evil government
of the Katabami Gold Mine,
180
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,750
and he liberated everybody
from the village!
181
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,910
One, two, one two…
182
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,370
One, two, one two…
183
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,620
Umm, Grandma…
184
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,120
Oh my… 					You are so greedy!
185
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,990
They are fighting their lives
out there by going into the gold mine…
186
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,790
Can’t you just wait at least
while I’m cooking the curry?
187
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,160
I don’t mind waiting but…
I think something is burning.
188
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,250
What?
189
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,410
Oh my, oh my…
190
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,990
Oops…
191
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, it burned…
192
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,580
Karashi, did you know that
193
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,500
Grandma Sansho worries about you
everyday while cooking curry?
194
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,450
Naruto, leave things to me here.
195
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,620
Karashi, you saved my life
with your curry of life.
196
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,160
If you can make such
a wonderful curry,
197
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,370
how can you stay with the family of
a man with no respect for life?!
198
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Why?
199
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,990
Nobody cares to compliment me
even if I can make that curry.
200
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,120
As a man born in this world,
201
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,450
I should gain more power and
try to take over the world!
202
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,870
Instead of sitting around in that store
that no one patronizes anymore.
203
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,200
What? I can’t take this anymore!
204
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,160
Lee!
205
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,750
Karashi, not only did you and
Grandma Sansho’s curry save my life…
206
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
But you also taught me that
if you make it from the heart,
207
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,700
just one serving of curry
could save lives,
208
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,990
and that even somebody like me
could do anything just by trying hard.
209
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,990
You looked much stronger
and dignified then than you do now.
210
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,990
Karashi!
211
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,330
I’ve never seen anybody
who tries this hard.
212
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,660
I see. You want to save
this boy too, huh…
213
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Please promise me…
Please get out of the Kurosuki Family!
214
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,290
You're right…
215
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,990
I’m sorry… I’m so sorry!
216
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh, I’m so relieved.
217
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,370
Hey! Please get me out of here.
218
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,620
It’s dark and I can’t breathe.
219
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,250
Oh yeah!
220
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,370
We almost forgot
about Rokusuke.
221
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,990
Mmm? You guys…
222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.
lt’s all right now.
223
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,450
I’m sorry. Thinking that maybe
224
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,950
I could still save my friend
who got buried alive…
225
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,120
I just couldn’t stay still.
226
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,290
Yeah, I understand.
227
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,450
Neji, what is it?
228
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,040
What is this?
229
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,580
This feeling of danger…
230
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,990
Hey Neji, what is it?
231
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,990
We are being watched.
lt’s probably Raiga.
232
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
What?
233
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,990
From the top of that cliff…
234
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,410
Okay. Let’s go!
235
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,660
Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke.
236
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,870
All right.
237
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,160
No one’s here.
238
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,450
Where did he go?
239
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,660
Mmm? What is that?
240
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,580
This mist…
241
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,990
Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!
242
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,700
Hidden Mist Jutsu…
A specialty of Mist Village Ninja.
243
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,290
So, what Guy Sensei said was true?
244
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,040
Damn, I can’t see anything!
245
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,120
Neji, try to find the enemy
with your Byakugan.
246
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,870
I’ve been trying…!
247
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,990
Uh…Can’t see a thing!
248
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,120
That’s impossible.
Even Neji’s Byakugan
249
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,450
that’s supposed to let him
see 360 degrees won’t work!
250
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,950
What’s going on?
251
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,500
There isn’t supposed to be
a Jutsu that can break Byakugan!
252
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,990
What do you think, Ranmaru?
253
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,580
It’s amazing…
254
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,410
One of them can see through
the Chakra Network.
255
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,250
He probably has some sort
of Kekkei Genkai power.
256
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,000
He can see us?
257
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,410
It’s all right,
my power is superior to his…
258
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,990
So, what are you going to do?
259
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,450
Everybody in the Katabami
Gold Mine is depending on me.
260
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,910
I’m the one who has to
keep the peace of this village.
261
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,120
Are you going to hold a funeral?
262
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:24,290
No, even if I hold a funeral,
I have no memories of them.
263
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,990
I’ll just get rid of them!
264
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,410
Look,
Ninja Art: Lightning Fang!
265
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,580
Wh-What is it?!
266
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,990
Lighting! Drop!
267
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,120
What do you think, Ranmaru?
268
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,080
It’s great, Raiga!
269
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,990
Crappy news pass us by
270
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,500
And you become speechless
271
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,500
My voice is way too soft
272
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,790
So you don’t answer
273
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,410
You’re crying   Crying alone
274
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,250
What can I do?   I’m crying too
275
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,950
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
276
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:06,990
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
277
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,700
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
278
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:25,910
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
279
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:37,660
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
280
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Naruto Barrage! What?
281
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,500
Leaf Hurricane! Mm?
282
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,120
Here I come! Huh?
283
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,200
Impossible!
284
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,000
Hey! The enemy disappeared!
285
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,660
I have nobody either!
286
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,040
What? There is no enemy!
287
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,450
Neji! Are you using
your Byakugan correctly?!
288
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,660
I am doing it right!
289
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,660
It’s impossible, but my Byakugan
is picking up Chakra!
290
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,160
Next time: “The Enemy of the Byakugan”
//%
1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,030
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:29,860
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,240
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,410
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,570
I'll laugh with  you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,120
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,990
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,120
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:12,280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,950
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:28,910
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,570
Not yet? Idate hasn’t come, yet?
13
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,120
My lord, we finally found evidence
14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,410
regarding the matter
we were investigating.
15
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh, I see.
16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,570
Mm, good work.
17
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,280
My lord, is there something amiss?
18
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,740
No, it’s nothing.
19
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,530
Concentrate on my Chakra.
20
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,530
We’re saved.
21
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,860
Sasuke, are you okay?
22
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,860
Naruto, I’m counting on you.
23
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,860
Protect Idate.
24
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,620
The Last Leg:
A Final Act of Desperation
25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,450
Poison needles won’t work on me.
26
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,410
How dare you do that
to Sasuke and Sakura?!
27
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,860
Rest easy.
28
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,860
I’ll send you to the place
where they are real soon.
29
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
I won’t go so easily!
30
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,860
Naruto.
31
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,860
But what do I do?
32
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,860
The Rasengan
won’t work on his sword.
33
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
It doesn’t matter.
34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,490
Those two are waiting for my help!
35
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,370
Saving each other again, huh?!
36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,910
They wouldn’t survive
falling off this cliff.
37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,160
Shut up!
38
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,450
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
39
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,700
Oh…you’re going to run away
from here using such a diversion?
40
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,860
Don’t mess with me!
Who’s going to run away?
41
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,450
Naruto, it’s futile.
That technique won’t work on that sword!
42
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,030
It’s futile!
43
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,410
Naruto!
44
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,820
Just like the Uchiha loser earlier,
45
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,280
why is it that each and every
Leaf Village Ninja is an idiot?
46
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,820
Shut up!
47
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,320
I’m going to save those two!
48
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,410
Are you seriously thinking
they’re alive after falling off this cliff?
49
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,280
You should’ve gotten out of here.
50
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,030
As if…
51
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,570
I'd abandon my comrades
and run away!
52
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,860
That’s my answer to the tenth problem!
53
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
What’re you saying?
54
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,450
One more time.
55
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,700
Eat this.
56
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,070
Idiot.
57
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,860
Rasengan!
58
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,070
Naruto…!
59
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,910
You still don’t get it?!
You don’t have a chance of winning!
60
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,070
Damn!
61
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,070
That's…
62
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,870
the damage Sasuke inflicted.
63
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,410
That's it!
64
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,740
If I aim for that…
65
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,530
I can win!
66
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,370
You saying you still want to fight?
Give it up, already!
67
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,200
Shut up! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
68
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,410
Sasuke…
69
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,120
Sasuke gave me a chance!
I won't waste it!
70
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,780
Naruto…
71
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,990
Stay still!
72
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,370
Sasuke! They’re using
the Water Clone Jutsu!
73
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,030
I know!
74
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,620
Trust us, Idate!
We’ll protect you, no matter what!
75
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,240
S-Sakura…
76
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,860
Go on ahead.
We’ll be right behind you.
77
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,620
Sakura!
78
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,870
I…
79
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,990
I hate people who don’t know
when to quit.
80
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,910
This is the end.
81
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,950
A foolish cheap trick.
82
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,280
What?!
83
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,160
I’m saying I can’t stand this
saving each other business.
84
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,620
Idate!
85
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,910
Your opponent is over here!
86
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,160
Above!
87
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,860
Rasengan!
88
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,860
What?!
89
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,320
It can’t be!
90
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,320
Naruto, you did it!
91
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,490
Naruto…
92
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,570
You’re really something.
93
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,860
Yeah, well…
94
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:02,990
Sakura!
95
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,490
Naruto…! Idate…!
96
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,320
Sakura!
97
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,990
She’s okay?
98
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,620
Sasuke’s okay, too.
99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,820
I’m coming to save you now,
believe it.
100
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,280
Idiot. Forget about us and
get going to the finish line, quick!
101
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh, that’s right.
102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,160
But what should we do about this?
103
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,820
Leave it to me.
104
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,860
We’ll cut the rope and go
to the opposite bank in one swing!
105
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
I get it!
106
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,370
I thought the worst of myself.
107
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,410
But Boss Jirocho trusted in me.
108
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,570
I trust you more than anyone.
109
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,410
It was the first time
I was trusted by someone.
110
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,860
So I wanted to win this race
for the boss, no matter what.
111
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,860
But in reality, I can’t win
just with such feelings.
112
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,910
So many times along the way,
I felt like giving up.
113
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,280
Watch out!
114
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,860
But each time,
115
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,870
you guys risked your lives
to save a lame duck like me!
116
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,030
Naruto, I’m sorry.
117
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,860
I should’ve trusted you guys
from the start.
118
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,370
What’re you saying?
119
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,860
Say stuff like that
after winning the race.
120
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
You’re right.
121
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,200
Naruto!
122
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,490
Idate!
123
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,860
Okay, do it!
124
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,910
Right!
125
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,950
Boo! Boo! Boo!
126
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,950
Now that's a rousing welcome.
127
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,740
Naruto, at this rate,
we’ll crash into the rocks!
128
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,280
I know. Leave it to me!
129
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,370
Release Chakra from
the bottom of my feet.
130
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,820
It’s the very last Chakra!
131
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,870
Then stick to
the rocks with Chakra!
132
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
All right, Naruto!
133
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,820
Now dash to the finish line!
134
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Sakura, I’ll come back
to help you right away!
135
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,990
Okay. Let’s go, Idate.
136
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,860
Right!
137
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,950
Run steady, Fukusuke!
138
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,860
Stay sharp until the end.
139
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,870
Shut up! I know.
140
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,570
Geez…spoiling my good mood.
141
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,860
I can see the Todoroki Great Shrine.
142
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,490
Boss!
143
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Blast it!
144
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,200
Good, good.
145
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,030
Idate.
146
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,870
– Hey! 					– Oh!
147
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,240
Hey! What’s that?
148
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,870
Here he comes!
149
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,660
Idate of the Wasabi Family’s here!
150
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,570
Go!
151
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,030
You can still catch up!
152
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,990
What?!
153
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,660
Idate!
154
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,570
Idiot!
155
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,660
What’re you doing, Fukusuke?! Run!
156
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,160
Damn it!
157
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,410
I won’t lose.
158
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,410
I will not lose!
159
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,860
I won’t give up until the very end!
160
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,570
Like heck. I won’t be passed up
after I've come this far!
161
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,950
– All right!
– He caught up.
162
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,320
Blast this guy…!
163
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,280
I won’t lose, you little…!
164
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,370
Blast…
165
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,870
Idate…!
166
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,700
Come on, Idate!
167
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,860
Boss!
168
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,700
Go! Idate…!
169
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,860
All right!
170
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,240
I did it!
171
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,530
Idate.
172
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,570
You ran a fine race.
173
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,280
Boss!
174
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,660
You did well.
175
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,120
Boss, I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.
176
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,570
You fool. What’re you apologizing for?
177
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,530
You won.
178
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,700
No, please let me speak.
179
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,450
I really want to apologize now.
I’m truly sorry!
180
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,860
You're making no sense to me.
What a totally weird guy.
181
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,860
Well done, Idate.
182
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,200
I was wrong about you.
183
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay, Idate.
Go receive the winner’s blessing.
184
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,660
Yes!
185
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,700
Hey, Idate!
186
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,490
Hey, you idiot!
187
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,910
Bringing shame upon the boss!
You’re prepared, aren’t you?
188
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,160
I-I’m sorry!
189
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,620
The winner!
190
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,660
Idate Morino of the Wasabi Family!
191
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,410
He finally did it.
192
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,410
Hey, hey… Just a minute.
193
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,660
Kyuroku.
194
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,990
Along the way, he rode
on the back of a hired Ninja.
195
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,120
This is a violation.
196
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,620
W-What?
197
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,160
There’s proof.
198
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Look at this photo.
199
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,860
Racing until the end on your own strength
is the rule of this race.
200
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,780
Therefore, Idate is disqualified.
201
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,870
The winner is Fukusuke Hikyakuya
of the Wagarashi Family.
202
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,990
No way.
203
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,860
H-Hold it. That was…!
204
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,070
I’ll hear no excuses!
Jirocho, it’s a promise.
205
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,860
I order the Wasabi Family
dissolved immediately.
206
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
Just a minute.
207
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,570
There is no such rule anywhere.
Do not speak nonsense!
208
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,160
M-My lord!
209
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,530
Or perhaps…
210
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,200
you have a reason for wanting
the Wagarashi to win at all cost?
211
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,070
No, nothing like that.
212
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,660
Could it be because you would
not be able to do things like this?
213
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,660
Look.
214
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,860
You fool!
Retire and enter the monastery!
215
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,030
Yes, yes, my lord!
216
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,950
Kyuroku Wagarashi.
217
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,280
Y-Yes?
218
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,620
Word of your evil deeds
has reached my ears as well.
219
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,240
Your sins against the people
of Degarashi Port are severe.
220
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,860
Therefore, the Wagarashi Family
is to be dissolved as of today.
221
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,910
Understood?
222
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,240
Y-Yes, sire.
223
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,990
Today is an auspicious day.
224
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,860
With this, the matter is settled.
225
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,860
Thanks for the help, Naruto.
226
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,860
Idate, this is good-bye, huh?
227
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,620
I’ve come to get the wounded.
228
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,490
Ibiki.
229
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,280
B-Big Brother!
230
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,370
Where are the wounded?
231
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,570
Over here.
232
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,620
Okay, get him on the boat, quickly.
233
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,160
R-Right.
234
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,860
Um, excuse me.
235
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,780
What is it?
236
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,120
N-Nothing.
237
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,860
Brother!
238
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,280
Wait, Big Brother!
239
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Who are you?
240
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,740
The man who called me
Big Brother died three years ago.
241
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,200
Big Brother… I figured out
the answer to the tenth problem!
242
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,280
I’ll never betray a comrade again!
243
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,700
I can trust others now!
244
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,860
He's looking good now.
245
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,990
'Bye, Idate. Let’s meet again.
246
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,910
Good-bye. See you around.
247
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,870
Yeah. You guys come again, too, okay?
248
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
I wish you good health, Boss!
249
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,860
Yeah…
250
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,700
See ya!
251
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,450
Take care!
252
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,120
An interesting guy as always.
253
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,450
No wonder the Fifth Hokage
sees potential in him.
254
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,990
Naruto! Thanks!
255
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,870
Idate! Next time,
it’ll be a battle with me, believe it.
256
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,070
Sasuke, does it hurt?
257
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,370
No.
258
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,910
Thank goodness.
259
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,860
Those wounds will heal immediately
once we get back to the village.
260
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,780
Right.
261
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,870
The rumors were true.
262
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,370
The survivor of
the village’s honorable Uchiha Clan…
263
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,860
is just a good-for-nothing kid…
264
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,320
I couldn’t beat him!
265
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,780
And yet, he…
266
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,450
that Naruto...!
267
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,860
Once in a long while, once in a while
268
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,620
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
269
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,860
Look like a mountain
270
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:54,030
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
271
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,780
The remnants of a person crying
272
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,820
Look like a mountain
273
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,490
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
274
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,320
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
275
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,660
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
276
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,860
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
277
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,990
Look like a mountain
278
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,240
Look like a mountain
279
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,860
Look like a mountain
280
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,030
Look like a mountain
281
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,740
Hey Sasuke and Naruto,
what's happened to both of you?
282
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,070
This is a hospital,
and Sasuke's still recuperating!
283
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,280
Even you should know better, Naruto.
284
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,860
Stop the antics already!
285
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,240
Why, why's this happening?!
286
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,200
Next time: "The Battle Begins:
Naruto vs. Sasuke"
//%
1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,550
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,350
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,470
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,760
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,300
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,930
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,550
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,970
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,590
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,590
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,180
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,590
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,640
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,590
What do you mean by
monitoring Akamaru?
16
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,430
You know about the incident
17
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,600
where someone from outside
infiltrated the village, right?
18
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,590
Yeah, I know about that.
19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,510
But I heard that Kiba and the others
resolved that incident without any trouble.
20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,510
That’s right.
21
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,590
Damn! That Kiba!
22
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,600
I want a mission where
I totally kick an enemy’s butt.
23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,550
To be exact, that’s wrong.
24
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,600
What?
25
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,640
Before Kiba and the others
had the intruder in custody…
26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,590
he swallowed a pellet
and killed himself.
27
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,300
What? Suicide…?
28
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,050
In the investigation that followed,
29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,760
it was revealed that the enemy
was a Shinobi
30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
from another land that uses
a unique tactic.
31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,100
Perhaps he took his own life
in order to seal that power.
32
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,470
What’s the “unique” tactic?
33
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,220
Something you would call
a biological weapon.
34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,850
Biological weapon?
35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,720
It’s a particular pathogen…
36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,510
a terrible weapon where someone
infected will gradually lose oneself
37
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,590
and have their body taken over.
38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,100
But how is that connected
with monitoring Akamaru?
39
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,220
Could it be that Akamaru was…?!
40
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,010
There’s a possibility he’s infected.
41
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,180
He still doesn’t look so well.
42
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,260
Y-Yeah…
43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,930
Since Akamaru’s not
in his best condition,
44
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,100
I’m skipping training today as well.
45
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,050
Okay…
46
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,590
Oh!
47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,720
Wh-What’re you doing, Shino?!
48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,800
Shino, do something quick!
49
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,600
Shino!
50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,100
The insects suddenly
stopped listening to me.
51
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,590
Jeez, give me a break.
52
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,800
I’m sorry.
53
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,300
We’ll head back early
for the time being. See ya.
54
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,800
I hope… Akamaru gets better soon.
55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
Shino?
56
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,470
It’s the first time the insects
have attacked a comrade…
57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,680
What is it, Akamaru?
58
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,350
Oh, shoot! I’ve been spotted!
59
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,140
What’re you doing, Naruto?
60
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,760
Wh-What, you ask?
61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,180
I’m developing a new Jutsu,
believe it!
62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,140
So as for me, I’m busy and…
63
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,180
Kiba's Long Day
64
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,640
Is there no mistake, Sis?
65
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,510
I’d say the possibility
at this point is around fifty-fifty.
66
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,930
I still haven’t been able to identify it,
67
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,260
but these are the lab results of
the blood drawn from Akamaru…
68
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,680
But! It could be some kind of mistake!
69
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,050
Do you think I, a veterinarian,
would make such a mistake?
70
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,890
Yeah… You’re right.
71
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,850
What is it, Akamaru?!
72
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,970
Let go! Let go!
73
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,430
Akamaru, it’s Naruto. It’s okay to let go.
74
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,260
Hey, Akamaru!
75
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,350
Akamaru!
76
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,010
What did you do that for Akamaru?
77
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,890
I mean, what’re you doing
in the front yard of my house?
78
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,680
Huh? Well, that’s…
79
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,300
Anyway, come in.
80
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,180
For the time being, I have to fulfill
my responsibility as the owner.
81
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,300
What?
82
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,430
What?!
83
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,590
Geez! Biting a comrade
of the same village can’t be allowed!
84
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,760
Are you training him properly, Kiba?!
85
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,600
All right.
86
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,390
It’s finished! Perfect if
I do say so myself!
87
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,140
Sis! That looks just like
a surgical scar!
88
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,550
What? Really?
I thought it turned out well, though…
89
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,590
Sorry, Naruto.
90
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,430
Have Sakura or someone
patch them up for you!
91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Hm? Right…
92
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,220
See ya.
93
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,850
Right.
94
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,300
See you later too, Miss Hana!
95
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,800
Akamaru…
96
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,140
I’m telling you,
97
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,220
there’s nothing else other than
my pants getting all torn up.
98
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,390
Shino’s insects attacked Akamaru…
99
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,050
He even attacked Naruto, whom
he should know very well.
100
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,220
There’s trouble, Lady Tsunade!
101
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,220
It seems they were attacked
by someone
102
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,970
in the middle of night training.
103
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Looks like they launched
a sneak attack with quite a few men.
104
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,720
No, it seems there was just one culprit.
105
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,050
What?! All of this by one person?!
106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,140
To be precise, that’s not correct.
107
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,350
It’s one animal.
108
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,590
There’s no doubt.
109
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,680
There’s trouble, Kiba!
110
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,720
You’re talking about the incident
111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,010
where Shinobi were attacked during
night training last night, right…?
112
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,760
It-It can’t be!
113
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,180
It seems it’s as you said, Sis…
114
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,590
I can smell blood from Akamaru.
115
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,590
That’s Kiba Inuzuka’s
Ninja Hound Akamaru, correct?
116
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,470
You jerks.
What do you want with Akamaru?!
117
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,760
A warrant…?
118
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,010
Kiba…!
119
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,590
Yes, there’s no mistake.
120
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,930
Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,
121
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,590
the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept
122
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,590
under the supervision
of the Anbu Black Ops.
123
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,890
– Damn it! 					– Kiba!
124
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,350
We should obey
the Lady Hokage’s order.
125
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,970
Damn it!
126
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,050
Akamaru…
127
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,720
Here.
128
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,220
Thanks, Sis.
129
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,800
This contains medicine that I prepared,
130
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,010
so give it to the vet over there.
131
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,590
Right. I’m off, then.
132
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,850
Naruto…?
133
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,220
What’s the idea of Akamaru
being detained?!
134
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,010
Akamaru is the culprit from
last night’s incident.
135
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,050
We have sufficient proof as well.
136
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,760
At this point, it’s an unavoidable measure.
137
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,050
The Medical Team is now desperately
looking for a way to save Akamaru.
138
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,470
Don’t worry too much.
139
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,590
If…that doesn’t work either,
what’ll happen to Akamaru?
140
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,590
At that time…
141
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,220
there’ll be nothing left to do
but to put Akamaru down!
142
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,970
Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital
143
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,010
You don’t need to worry.
144
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,300
The Medical Corps will figure
something out soon.
145
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,470
Right…
146
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,590
Take care on your way home.
147
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,140
Right.
148
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,300
Akamaru…
149
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,470
I won’t hand you over to anyone.
150
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,590
It seems Kiba Inuzuka
has taken Akamaru and fled.
151
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,260
Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?
152
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,050
In preparation for the worst,
153
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,390
have the Special Pursuit Corps
stand by here!
154
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,470
The Special Pursuit Corps…
155
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,680
C-Could it be that you’re really
going to kill Akamaru…Grandma?
156
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,720
Grandma Tsunade!
157
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,100
It’s hard for me, too.
158
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,430
Damn it!
159
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,850
Did you find them?!
160
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,050
No!
161
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,590
Kiba!
162
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,850
Kiba!
163
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,590
He’s rapidly getting worse.
164
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,430
Akamaru!
165
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,590
Where are they?
166
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,010
They should be around here.
167
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
I swore to protect him,
no matter what!
168
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,590
I swore never I’d never let him go through
that experience ever again…!
169
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,260
The Special Pursuit Corps
has assembled.
170
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,220
Show the team in.
171
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,600
Kiba!
172
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,760
Where are you?!
173
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,220
I guess I was able to hide
my tracks somewhat…
174
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,600
This is a serum for Akamaru
that the Medical Corps whipped up.
175
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,430
I can’t guarantee the level of effect.
176
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,260
There’s maybe a fifty-percent chance
of survival.
177
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,800
There’s also a risk of side-effects
178
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,550
that would cause Akamaru
to go even more berserk.
179
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,050
In the event that happens…
180
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,640
It’s an unavoidable measure,
but Akamaru must…
181
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,180
Reporting!
182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,050
The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has
lost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.
183
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,300
Lady Tsunade.
184
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,760
That way?!
185
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,590
Akamaru…
186
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Kiba!
187
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,300
Wh-What’s that?
188
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,050
It’s Akamaru…
189
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,470
But…
190
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,970
I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone!
191
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,720
What’re you doing?!
192
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,220
Have you come to kill Akamaru?!
193
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,260
No! I just came out of concern!
194
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,760
You lie! The Lady Hokage said it,
didn’t she?!
195
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,590
There’ll be nothing else to do
but to kill Akamaru.
196
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,850
You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!
197
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,510
I won’t hand over Akamaru
to anyone!
198
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,260
This isn’t the time
to be doing that!
199
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,350
Something called the Special Pursuit Corps
or whatever is coming after Akamaru!
200
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,430
What?!
201
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,100
The Pursuit Corps should
be here soon.
202
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,800
Akamaru will really be
in trouble if that happens!
203
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,140
You and I have to do
something before that!
204
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,850
This isn’t the time to be fighting!
205
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,220
Shut up!
206
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,930
Why don’t you get it, Kiba?!
207
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,510
Shut up!
208
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,430
All right! I’ve sighted Akamaru!
209
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,260
Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!
210
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,680
C-Could it be…the Pursuit Corps is…
211
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,590
Sis!
212
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,640
You gotta be… joking, right?
213
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,100
Sis!
214
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,300
What’re you going to do
to Akamaru with that?
215
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,930
This is medicine I received
from the Hokage.
216
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,220
I’m going to inject it into Akamaru.
217
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,180
Then Akamaru will be saved?!
218
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,350
The probability is fifty-fifty.
219
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,890
If it fails and side-effects are produced,
220
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,390
Akamaru’s symptoms will
get even worse.
221
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,010
All we can do now is take
a chance on this.
222
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,390
If the worst happens and it fails…
223
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,720
You understand, right, Kiba?
224
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,470
Damn it…
225
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,600
Even if it’s only fifty percent,
226
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,220
there’s a possibility that Akamaru
will be saved.
227
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,800
We’ve gotta do this!
I’ll also help out, miss!
228
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,010
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
229
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,600
Kiba, what about you?!
230
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,220
If you’re not going to do anything,
you’re in the way, so beat it!
231
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,760
Let’s go, Kiba.
232
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,930
Just leave that coward be.
233
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,590
You’re ready, right?
Let’s go, Naruto!
234
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
We’ll save you now, Akamaru!
235
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,390
Aim for the legs!
lmmobilize Akamaru!
236
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,010
Right!
237
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,680
Since it’s come to this,
I have no choice.
238
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,680
I must terminate Akamaru.
239
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,180
Stop!
240
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,470
I said stop… Akamaru.
241
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,260
Kiba!
242
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,590
Kiba?
243
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,100
Akamaru…
244
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,970
Have you forgotten…my scent?
245
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,720
We were always together from
when we were little, weren’t we?
246
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Akamaru…
247
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,550
Why…why…did you become like this?
248
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,550
Please remember… Akamaru!
249
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:09,970
Kiba!
250
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,260
I'm sorry, Akamaru…
251
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,510
I put you through nothing but
painful experiences.
252
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,590
I’m sorry, Akamaru…
I couldn’t protect you…
253
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,470
I’m sorry… Akamaru…
254
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,010
I'm a terrible master.
255
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,140
But…
256
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,640
I’ll…always be with you.
257
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,590
Kiba…
258
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,970
Kiba!
259
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,590
It really would’ve been touch and go
260
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,550
if the Medical Corps had been
even a little late in arriving.
261
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,590
Without a doubt,
262
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,850
he would’ve lost his life if Akamaru’s attack
had hit Kiba’s vital spot…
263
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,720
Really, it could have been
much worse.
264
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,220
That’s wrong…
265
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,850
Huh? Kiba?!
266
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,680
When he came at me with
his final attack,
267
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,590
Akamaru just barely missed
my vital spots.
268
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,590
He drained all his remaining strength
in order to desperately control himself.
269
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,390
Akamaru was battling desperately
with himself.
270
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,590
That’s admirable, Akamaru!
271
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,470
Thanks…
272
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,600
Akamaru.
273
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,680
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
274
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,510
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
275
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,010
Yellow Moon.
276
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:58,850
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
277
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,050
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
278
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,010
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
279
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:17,890
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
280
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:24,600
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
281
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,550
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
282
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,140
A magical chord change, in a restless city
283
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,180
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
284
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,800
In this world, there remain mysteries
yet unsolved.
285
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,550
We came to the Hidden Leaf Village
in search of mystery
286
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,640
and encountered a succession
of hair-raising terror.
287
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,510
However, we charge forward
without being daunted
288
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,800
by the forest that bares its fangs.
289
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,430
And then at last…!
290
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,430
We witness with our own eyes,
291
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,590
the creature of the legend handed down
from generation to generation.
292
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,220
Next time:
“A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:
The Onbaa!
//%
1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,490
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,330
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,450
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,750
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,290
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,910
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,490
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,950
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,500
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,540
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,160
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,490
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,620
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,750
A coup at the Land of Green…?
16
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,080
Yes, it seems there’s no mistake.
17
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,040
The retainers conspired with
some men
18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,490
and began a rebellion…
19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
What happened to Naruto
and the others?
20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,540
Speculating from their gathering point,
21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,450
they are around here.
22
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,330
So they’ve already
crossed the border…
23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,410
The large countries have agreed
to make this
24
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,450
a demilitarized zone.
25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,000
Considering Naruto and
the other’s mission,
26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,290
they should be in a safe area…
27
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,330
Are you sure?
28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,700
What do you mean…?
29
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,700
Don’t you think the timing
of this request
30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,250
strangely overlaps with the coup?
31
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,290
Then you’re saying that Naruto’s mission
is also related to this case?
32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,830
There is a possibility…
33
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,490
But there’s no time to deal
with Naruto at the moment.
34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,700
We have to take back
the Land of Green
35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,490
from the rebels as soon as possible.
36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,580
If we leave it like this,
37
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,120
the flames of the war will eventually
reach other countries…
38
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,080
True…
39
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,330
Shizune, gather the free villagers
40
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,790
and have them head to
the Land of Green immediately!
41
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,410
Yes, ma'am!
42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,250
You’ve done it now!
43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,040
What a persistent brat…!
44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You shouldn't be able
to stand anymore…
45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,490
Naruto!
46
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,040
This is…nothing.
47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,750
What a surprise…
you got some guts.
48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,450
Then, take this too!
49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,490
Ninja Art Magnet!
Electromagnetic Illusion.
50
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,750
Naruto!
51
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,490
It’s useless!
Your voice wouldn’t reach him!
52
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,490
The human brain functions by
53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,250
a faint electric current
running through it…
54
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,620
If you receive
my magnetic force powder,
55
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,080
it’s going to alter your electric
current and stop your thinking…
56
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,250
That chain also has
a strong magnetic force.
57
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,950
Now, get buried!
58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,160
Naruto!
59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,450
Are you okay?
60
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,490
Thank goodness…
61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,580
Hinata…run!
62
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,080
I can’t leave you behind…
63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,870
He is…
64
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,330
He’s someone that
you can’t deal with…
65
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,290
Naruto… I promise I’ll save you!
66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,750
Hinata!
67
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,040
I’ll have you tell me
where that girl is!
68
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,490
Byakugan!
69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
Take this!
Electromagnetic Illusion!
70
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,080
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
71
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,490
What?!
72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,250
I see, so that is the Byakugan
of the Village Hidden in Leaves…
73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,790
How interesting!
74
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,330
What wonderful Taijutsu, but…
75
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,870
I’ll crush it
with my power!
76
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,500
I did it…?!
77
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah right…
That level of Taijutsu will not work!
78
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,040
It’s useless!
79
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,490
This is bad…!
80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,490
You’re not much of a challenge.
I’m disappointed!
81
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,370
Now tell me!
Where did you hide that girl?
82
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,330
If you answer me, I’ll let you live…
That boy too!
83
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,120
If you rescue him right now,
he wouldn’t die.
84
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,250
Run…Hinata…
85
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,790
Now say it!
86
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,620
You don’t want to save
that boy?
87
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,490
Or do you think you could win
against me?
88
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,490
If I say it…
Naruto would never forgive me.
89
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,490
Then I’ll force you to talk!
90
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,580
I’ll change the area behind you
into a powerful magnet.
91
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,490
I can change the position of the magnet
according to your movement.
92
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,200
So it's a waste to run away!
93
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,870
That brat…
94
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,200
She evaded the attack by throwing
a paper bomb at that very instant.
95
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,620
She’s pretty quick witted.
96
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,040
But…
97
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,330
I won’t let you go!
98
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,750
Hinata…
99
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,910
Naruto… I promise that
I’ll return to rescue you…!
100
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,040
But, there is a huge difference
in power between him and me…
101
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,540
I could never win against him!
102
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,490
He’s already caught up to me…
What should I do?
103
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
This is…iron sand…?
104
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,410
I see…his Jutsu can
change his body
105
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,450
and the things he touches
into magnet.
106
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,790
The reason why he didn’t attack
back there
107
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,910
was to brush off the iron sand
from his body…
108
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,500
If he doesn’t,
he would sink in his iron sand.
109
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,290
His attack pattern consists of
alternating between
110
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,750
Ninja Art Magnet
and Iron Sand Genjutsu …
111
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,330
He does this to turn
his magnet powers on and off
112
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,330
so his body won’t
completely turn into a magnet.
113
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,750
Then, there is one way
to beat him!
114
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,910
Now…play time is almost over!
115
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,700
Now, it’s time you give up!
116
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,490
I would never give up!
117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,250
Because that is my Ninja Way!
118
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,290
What a waste…
119
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,080
How dare you do that to Naruto!
120
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,490
I will definitely not forgive you!
121
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,490
Once you say where
that girl is,
122
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,490
why don’t you live with
that brat in hell!
123
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,490
Hey, don’t be shy
and come closer!
124
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,490
Right now!
125
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,620
I’ll risk everything
in this single attack!
126
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,490
An attack that didn’t work before,
127
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,950
will never work!
128
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,040
Is…that right?
129
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,490
What?!
130
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,750
We're both going to hell!
131
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,000
Let go, you!
132
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,040
You brat! How dare you play
around with me!
133
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,700
I changed my mind.
I’ll finish you off now!
134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
What is this?!
135
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,450
Just now…
I struck a Chakra Point
136
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,910
that would make your Chakra flow
go out of control.
137
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,000
Now your body will just turn
into a strong magnet…
138
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,540
What…? That’s why you brought me
to this sandy area?!
139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
S-Stop!
140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,500
I did it…Naruto…
141
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,910
Damn…! I can’t move!
142
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,490
The Human Boulder!
143
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,580
Naruto!
144
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,620
Choji…!
145
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,450
Are you okay, Naruto…?
146
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,750
Thanks…Yurinojou.
147
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,080
So what happened?
148
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,870
The second Janin attacked me
and I got beaten up.
149
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,200
What happened to Hinata
and the princess?
150
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,040
Oh yeah…!
151
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,490
I can’t stay here!
152
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,200
What…?
What’s going on…? Naruto?
153
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,250
Hinata is in danger!
154
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,490
–Oh! Naruto! 					–Naruto!
155
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,370
Hinata!
156
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,750
Are you okay…Hinata?
157
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,750
Hang in there, Hinata!
158
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,410
N-Naruto… Choji…
159
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,750
Yurinojou…
160
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
You guys…
you guys came to rescue me…
161
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,830
Of course…
We’re friends, right?!
162
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,080
Yes!
163
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,290
By the way, that magnet guy…
Where did he go?
164
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,000
He probably sunk into the sand…
165
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,330
What?! You did it, Hinata?
166
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,830
Yeah… I did my best…
167
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,500
Hinata, you’re great…
168
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,490
The guy that I couldn’t handle…
169
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,830
You’re complimenting me?
170
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Naruto…
171
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,200
Here…
172
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,490
This is…my forehead band?
173
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,750
The mission is not over yet.
174
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,490
Naruto, please protect the princess…
Princess Haruna.
175
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,620
Hinata…
176
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,250
I’ll promise you!
177
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,910
I swear on this forehead band
I will definitely protect the Princess!
178
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,000
And…
179
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,490
I can’t be losing against you!
180
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,490
Naruto…
181
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,000
Look after Hinata, Choji…Yurinojou!
182
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,500
Right!
183
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,490
Leave it to us…Naruto!
184
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,490
Well, I’ll be darned.
185
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,040
I can’t believe that Ruiga
and Jiga were both defeated.
186
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,080
Well, that saves some
trouble though…
187
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,790
Nobody has ever escaped
from my Jutsu.
188
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,910
Today will be a good day.
189
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,490
Haruna! Where are you?!
190
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,490
There she is!
191
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,120
Haruna! Get a hold of yourself!
192
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,540
Are you okay?
193
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,490
I’m glad…
194
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,870
I-It’s me, Princess Haruna!
195
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,040
N-Naruto…
196
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,160
I came to rescue you,
197
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,250
but what is this treatment?
198
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:08,950
Sorry…
199
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,750
Why did you escape by yourself?
200
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,330
I can’t count on you guys…
201
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,700
I will try to survive
no matter who's sacrificed…
202
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,330
As long as I survive,
the Land of Green can be revived.
203
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,500
That’s the most important thing, right?!
204
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,830
I am a victim!
205
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,870
If I declare that other countries
will lend me their power.
206
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,160
If I take back the country and
207
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,290
I, the true successor,
become the feudal lord,
208
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,200
then people will definitely gather and
209
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,790
the Land of Green will return
to the way it was!
210
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,700
I don’t think so.
211
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,290
You’re saying that
the Land of Green won’t revive?
212
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,700
I’m not saying that…
213
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,410
But I just thought what if I lived
in the Land of Green…
214
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,450
If I was a Ninja just like Yurinojou…
215
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,750
I won’t guard a feudal lord like you!
216
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,290
Naruto!
217
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,490
What do you know?!
What do you know about me?!
218
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,160
What do you know about my life
as a hostage?!
219
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,290
Under watch 24/7,
220
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,120
not even allowed to have
my own free time,
221
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,870
I was lonely everyday.
222
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,490
Because of that lifestyle,
223
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,450
I became sick and was
in bed for a long time.
224
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,370
I was finally able to return home
after being close to dying…
225
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,080
Naruto! If you’re saying that
I’m wrong, then answer me!
226
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,950
Were the things done to me
227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,950
in the name of protecting
the Land of Green all wrong?!
228
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,490
Then why did my father and mother
send me away as a hostage?!
229
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,080
Answer me! Naruto!
230
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,700
I won’t count on you.
231
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,290
I will go by myself.
232
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,700
Wait. 					I will go too.
233
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,790
I promised Hinata that I will
definitely protect you, princess!
234
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,910
With Hinata…?
235
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,370
She fought with
the second Janin
236
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,370
and got hurt badly....
237
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,490
Hinata did…?
238
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,200
You guys said that you didn’t accept
the mission of protecting me.
239
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,620
Then, why do you concern yourselves
with me?
240
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,620
I…
241
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,490
Not only me,
but Hinata and Choji, too.
242
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,490
We don't like it when somebody before us
is hurt or sad… That's all.
243
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,410
Well, let’s go!
244
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,410
If we pass through the valley
ahead of us,
245
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,500
we’ll get to the town.
246
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,450
If we do that, they probably won't
chase us all the way there!
247
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,500
Please be careful…
248
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,250
No one uses this deer path.
249
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,700
This should shake them…
250
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,750
I found you!
251
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,790
It’s impossible…
to run away from me!
252
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,790
Choji?!
253
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,490
Don’t make useless efforts…
254
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,540
I’ll make you guys my hostages!
255
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,490
You guys take them back to the castle!
256
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,290
Yes!
257
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,250
If you wander around me
258
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,950
you might get caught
in my Jutsu and die.
259
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,490
That’s it…
We’re almost there!
260
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,490
There’s no time to waste!
Let’s go!
261
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,490
Okay!
262
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,490
Haruna!
263
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,700
I’m okay!
264
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,410
Oh no!
265
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,120
Wh-What is this?!
266
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,790
I see… You have good sense
to dodge that attack!
267
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,250
Who is it?! 					Where are you?!
268
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,410
Here, over here!
269
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,490
Too bad, but you guys won’t
be able to reach that village.
270
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,580
Since you guys are going
to die here!
271
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,490
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
272
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,080
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
273
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,580
Yellow Moon.
274
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:58,490
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
275
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,620
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
276
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,580
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
277
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:17,490
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
278
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,410
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
279
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:31,120
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
280
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,700
A magical chord change, in a restless city
281
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,750
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
282
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,490
Damn! He is so troublesome!
283
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,250
How dare he use many
showy attacks.
284
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,500
There is no way I can retaliate!
285
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,450
I've gotta do something.
286
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,290
At this rate, I’m gonna get cornered
and shot.
287
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,370
But even if I wanted to hide,
Haruna’s legs are…
288
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,490
Oh, damn it!
289
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,000
What in the world should I do?!
290
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,580
Next time: “Forecast: Death!
Cloudy with Chance of Sun!”
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,220
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,120
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,230
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,000
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,170
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,210
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,050
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,440
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,280
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,420
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,750
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,850
I’ll show you there are walls
20
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,560
which effort alone can
never break through.
21
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,940
Sakura Blossoms!
22
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,560
Huh?!
23
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,870
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
24
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,440
But our Jutsu exceeds that
and is the speed of sound!
25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,110
Lee!
26
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,320
My left ear...
27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,390
There’s a little gimmick I have.
28
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,230
Evading won’t work...
on my attacks.
29
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,910
What is he going to do?!
30
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,980
It’s sound.
31
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,610
Even though you evaded my fist,
sound assaulted you.
32
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,520
Sound?
33
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,560
Do you know what sound is
all about in the first place?
34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,760
Vibration?
35
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,200
Correct. In other words,
hearing sounds means,
36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,840
that the eardrum is
catching vibrating air.
37
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,080
And the human eardrum breaks
with sounds over 150 Mhz.
38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,650
Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal
which is located even deeper,
39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,690
I can make you totally lose balance.
40
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,000
You won’t be able to move your body
freely for sometime.
41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,540
Something old and tired
like Taijutsu don’t work on us.
42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,970
Well, you were doing good
up to a certain point,
43
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,280
but I brought forth my Jutsu.
44
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,880
It’s just not gonna work anymore.
45
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,590
I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves
and air pressure,
46
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,920
and have the power to
obliterate even boulders!
47
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,090
Primary Lotus!
48
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,630
I can send air into the ground
49
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,600
and change the dirt into
a cushion as I please.
50
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,900
It’s different from
your silly Jutsu.
51
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,810
Blast it!
52
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,860
Lee, it is all right to use
this Jutsu
53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
to protect someone precious.
54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,870
Protect... someone precious?
55
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,000
In any case,
56
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,340
I’m impressed that you
were able to master it, little man!
57
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,550
You did it quite well, Lee!
58
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,180
Darn it!
59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,550
Okay, then!
60
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,550
Next is...
61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,890
You!
62
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,090
Darn it!
63
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,120
He’s coming!
64
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,860
What?!
65
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,600
No way!
66
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,630
Lee!
67
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,500
Leaf...
68
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,340
Hurricane!
69
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,510
It looks like my earlier attack
is having an effect!
70
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,540
I’m somewhat surprised...
71
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,550
but there’s not even a trace of
that flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!
72
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,890
This arm amplifies sounds
from within to its maximum.
73
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,260
It’s a speaker of sorts!
74
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,970
Lee!
75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,400
And the assault sound isn’t limited
by the direction of my arm...
76
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,340
it always converges on
the targeted prey by my Chakra!
77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,640
Lee!
78
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,920
Now then... 					The final blow.
79
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,520
I won’t let you!
80
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,030
Oh, well.
81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Hey, let’s get outta here!
82
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,900
Those guys are pretty dangerous!
83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,170
It looks like Sasuke and Naruto
are only unconscious, but...
84
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,970
even that guy Lee’s been
messed up and Sakura’s alone.
85
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,010
What’re you gonna do, Ino?
86
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,480
What do you mean?
87
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,350
Well, Sakura’s in deep trouble!
88
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,850
You’re all right with that?
89
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,020
Huh?!
90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,460
You two were once close friends,
weren’t you?
91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,930
By the way...
92
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,470
What Sakura, don’t be so stiff!
93
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,380
Well...
94
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,810
Ino, I hear you also...
95
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,110
What is it?
96
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,690
...like Sasuke.
97
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,400
Then, that means from now on,
98
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,270
you and I are rivals.
99
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,520
Why... why am I recalling things
from that time?
100
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,550
Hey, Ino!
101
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,990
What’re you gonna do?!
102
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,560
I know, but there’s nothing I can do!
103
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
I can’t heedlessly
go out there, can I?!
104
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,000
Even if I went out now...
105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,640
I’d be taken down without a doubt.
106
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,540
I also...
107
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,970
I also...!
108
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,020
Air pressure!
The shurikens got bounced back?!
109
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,560
Your hair’s shinier than mine.
110
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,630
Hey! If you have time to worry
about your hair,
111
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,070
you should practice!
112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,840
Getting all spiced up like a woman...
113
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,580
Why don’t you kill that Sasuke guy
right in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?
114
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,650
Yeah! That sounds great!
115
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,550
Hey hey...
116
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,650
I won’t let you do such a thing!
117
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,250
Don’t move!
118
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,060
Sakura.
119
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,560
My body... It has no strength.
120
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,610
I...
121
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,550
Again... I’m just pulling everyone’s feet!
122
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,250
I’m always being protected.
123
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,420
It's so frustrating!
124
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,260
This time for sure...
I had thought!
125
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,930
This time for sure...
126
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,530
I must protect people precious to me...
so I thought!
127
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,470
So...
128
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Let’s do this!
129
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,400
Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are
gonna get it, too!
130
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,870
W-What should I do?!
131
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,110
That’s pointless!
132
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,180
That won’t work on me!
133
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,990
What are you saying?
134
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,190
Huh?
135
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,560
What?!
136
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,450
I always...
137
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,560
act as if I’m a full-fledged Ninja.
138
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,460
I always say that I like Sasuke.
139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,400
I always act like I know everything
and lecture Naruto.
140
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,540
I always just... watch them from behind.
141
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,520
And yet...
142
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,980
Tazuna, get back!
143
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,630
Get back!
144
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Now then...
145
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,540
Let’s get wild!
146
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,690
This is the only way to
take him down!
147
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,590
Sasuke!
148
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,510
Here it is!
149
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,540
Those two always covered
my back and fought for me.
150
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,120
Lee, you say that you like me...
151
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,100
I’ll protect you until I die!
152
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,740
Primary Lotus!
153
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,940
With me at your back...
154
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,540
you risked your life and
fought for me.
155
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,550
I have a feeling that you taught me...
156
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,550
Sakura!
157
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,350
Sakura!
158
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,520
Humph!
159
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,690
I want to be like all of you!
160
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,230
This time...
161
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,540
I want all of you...
162
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,310
to watch me...
163
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,940
...from behind!
164
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,550
Sakura?
165
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,150
Sakura...
166
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,260
Kin! Kill her!
167
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,560
Huh! That sign...
168
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,540
Substitution Jutsu!
169
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,670
On the right, huh?
You think I’m a fool?
170
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,940
With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...
171
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,040
you think you can come at me?!
172
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,380
Kin, get out of the way!
173
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,320
Useless!
174
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,890
Air pressure 100 percent,
ultrasonic waves 0%, output...
175
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,090
Is that all you can do?
176
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,760
Slicing Sound Wave!
177
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,400
You’re easy to spot...
178
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,400
You’re above!
179
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,070
I’ve said it two or three times that
that won’t work!
180
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,640
This is enough... for you!
181
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,040
Where next?
182
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,450
Huh?!
183
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,120
What...?!
184
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,550
This time... it’s not a substitution!
185
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,460
Get off me! Hey!
186
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,340
Sakura...
187
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,650
You’re always being called
“Billboard Brow” and being picked on.
188
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,550
Who’re you?
189
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:22,360
I’m called Ino Yamanaka.
How ‘bout you?
190
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,930
I’m... Sakura.
191
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,740
Huh? I can’t hear you.
Say it louder.
192
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,210
Sakura Haruno!
193
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,110
Huh, I see.
194
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,650
You have a wide forehead.
195
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,380
So, Billboard Brow, huh...?
196
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,990
That’s why you hide
your forehead with your bangs.
197
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,590
Like a ghost...
198
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,430
Sakura, was it?
199
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,570
Uh-huh...
200
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,140
Come back here tomorrow.
201
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,910
I’ll give you something nice.
202
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,210
Huh?
203
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,540
Darn, let go!
204
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,820
See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!
205
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,220
I’ll give you that ribbon.
206
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,760
T-Thanks.
207
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,860
But...
208
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,560
But what?
209
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,560
My forehead...
210
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,300
You hide it, so people make
more fun of you, you know?!
211
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,840
You have a cute face Sakura,
so you should be more confident!
212
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,970
More confident!
213
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,180
Ino...
214
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,480
Hey, who’s that?
Who’s she, Ino?
215
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,090
Her name’s Sakura.
216
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,550
Hey, say hello!
217
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,560
Hello...
218
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,560
Listen everybody! Listen!
219
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,500
There’s someone I like!
Who do you think it is?
220
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,970
Hurry up and tell us!
221
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,010
Don’t say it’s Sasuke?
222
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,480
Huh? Why’d you know?
223
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,210
What’re you talking about?
224
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,680
Sasuke’s really popular,
he’s the most popular!
225
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,550
Huh? Is that so?
226
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,560
Oh no! I’ll have a lot of rivals.
What should I do?!
227
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,300
Hey, Ino! Sakura’s been upbeat lately!
228
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,100
She’s just acting brave
and romping around!
229
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:53,180
Ino! I’ve heard Sasuke
likes girls with long hair.
230
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:59,680
...likes girls with long hair.
...likes girls with long hair.
231
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,250
Sakura...
232
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,260
I’ve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.
233
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,430
From now on, we’re rivals.
234
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,530
Your hair. It’s grown quite a bit.
235
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,300
Ino...
236
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,840
Why...
237
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,510
Why are you on the
same team as Sasuke?!
238
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,310
I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!
239
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:37,590
Me too! I won’t lose to you, Sakura.
No matter what!
240
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,640
...Sakura!
241
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,210
I will...
242
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,750
I will...
243
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,460
Give it up!
244
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,570
It’s really bad...
245
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,900
Hey, Ino...!
246
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,680
I must... protect everyone!
247
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,550
You punk!
248
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,630
Huh?
249
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,760
Huh! More strange ones.
250
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,570
Ino...?
251
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,640
Sakura! I promised
I wouldn’t lose to you, didn’t I?!
252
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,330
Hey, can you hear it?
253
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:31,530
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
254
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:41,040
The ocean spans limitlessly
255
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:49,420
Please keep that smile on your face forever
256
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,360
Or else I’ll cry
257
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,130
You won't have to search around you
258
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,770
It’s all ok now.
259
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:12,610
Everyone is inside
this hand
260
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,180
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
261
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,550
When you forget what happiness is
262
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,560
Just sing.
263
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,800
Light is born, and darkness was born
264
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,130
The two are one
265
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:40,540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
266
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,110
Hey, can you hear it?
267
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,550
Wow! This is Ino team’s battle?!
268
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,020
What a formation based on calculations!
269
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,150
I hate to admit it,
but they’re strong!
270
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,560
Even the Sound Village ones
would be no match for them!
271
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,730
We’ll protect Sasuke...
272
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,570
Huh?! What’s this feeling?
273
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,600
Next episode: "Battle Formation:
lno-Shika-Cho!"
274
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,570
What in the world is going on?!
//%
1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,850
Here we are, here we are,
here we are!
2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,890
“The Golden Time”!
3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,000
Starting tonight, “NARUTO” will be airing
every Wednesday, from 7:27 at night!
4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,600
– Leader… Leader…
– For those who always watch "Naruto,"
5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,400
and also for those who are watching
for the first time, please enjoy!
6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,010
Now, the new opening theme song,
7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,010
”HARUKA KANATA (Far Beyond)”
is about to start!
8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,540
Listen here! Leader!
9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,650
W-What is it Konohamaru?
I was just getting into it…
10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,820
It’s only 7 o’clock.
11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,690
What?
12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,020
You’re 27 minutes early.
13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,960
This is actually the time slot for
“The Prince of Tennis.”
14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,560
W-What?!
15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,090
W-W-What are we going to do?
16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,500
– I already did the greeting!
– It’s not my problem…
17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,400
I don’t care any more!
I’m going to start “NARUTO”!
18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,470
Hey, Sakura, Sasuke.
19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,280
Naruto went ahead and
started the program.
20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,540
Are you ready?
21
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,010
No, no! I’m still in the middle
of my facial!
22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,620
What about the VTR for the main show?
23
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,190
It hasn’t arrived here.
24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,550
I guess it can’t be helped.
25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,560
I’ll have to do some dancing…
26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,590
Nah! I mean I’m going to
get the VTR.
27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,360
In the meantime,
you guys will have to fill up the time.
28
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,930
What?!
29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
I’m depending on you.
This is your mission.
30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,570
Huh, a mission… all right!
31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,740
All right, we’ll do it!
32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,310
Hey, Naruto!
33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,310
This is all your fault for being so careless!
You have to learn your lesson!
34
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,110
Ouchh….
35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,250
Go Go!
36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,360
Press down hard on the gas
37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,260
That’s right, there’s no compromise
38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,430
We'll slip through the night
39
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,240
At the final moment push hard
40
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,410
That's right, all the way to zero,
41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Until we wipe away the days
42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,550
Gently open your heart
43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,250
If you pull it close to you
44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,690
It will reach you, without a doubt
45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,730
It will come, closer
46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,600
Now
47
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:46,110
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,550
Our feet are tied
49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,380
But we still keep going farther
50
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,820
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
51
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,560
If you’re not the one
52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,890
There will be no meaning
53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,400
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
54
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,820
W-What?
Where is this place?!
55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,630
Restricted Area
Do Not Enter
56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,910
This is the site of the second exam,
the 44th Training Field...
57
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,810
Also known as... the Forest of Death.
58
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,450
Forest of... Death?
59
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,050
Huh?
60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,890
Is that supposed to be... a rock?
61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,860
Moreover, on top of the grass?
62
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,730
Hey, Konohamaru!
What is it that you want?!
63
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,000
Just what I expect from the man I respect!
64
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,100
Good job on figuring it out!
65
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,540
Hey! Too much gunpowder used!
66
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,820
With an adult sexiness!
67
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,750
I’m Moegi of the senior class
at Kunoichi preschool!
68
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,890
I love factoring! 					Udon!
69
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,860
The most brilliant Ninja in the village!
Konohamaru!
70
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,560
The three of us together are
the Konohamaru Gang!
71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Here we are!
72
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,100
What’s going on you guys?
73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,540
Hey, I’m about to take the
second exam for the Chunin Exam.
74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,010
I have no time to be playing
around with you guys!
75
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,880
We didn’t come to play around!
76
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,480
That’s right!
We came here for an interview!
77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,990
That’s right…
78
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,720
Interview?
79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,390
Yeah, we were put in charge to write
the feature article for the “Chunin Exam,”
80
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,560
for the academy’s class newspaper.
81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,770
So that’s why we came to
interview you, leader…
82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,540
Please cooperate with us.
83
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,400
Please.
84
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,210
But...
85
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,080
Hey, over there!
86
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,280
What are you doing?!
87
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,320
Konohamaru here is asking about
an interview for the class newspaper…
88
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,560
Oh, I forgot that Lord Hokage was
mentioning something like that.
89
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,260
Hey, hey…
90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
All right, take a 10-minute break
starting now!
91
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,500
For those who will be interviewed,
resign yourselves and be courteous.
92
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,400
Hey, hey… What’s this all about?
93
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,640
Big brother Naruto!
I’m depending on you.
94
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,340
All right!
95
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,780
In that case, I'll just show you
how attractive I am!
96
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,680
Special Report:
Live from the Forest of Death!
97
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,420
Chapter of Character Introduction
98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,730
Please introduce yourself.
99
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay!
100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,230
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,540
A Ninja from Village Hidden
in the Leaves!
102
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
My hobby is to play pranks,
and I love ramen noodles,
103
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,510
I’ve just become a Genin but…
104
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,540
My dream is big, to become a Hokage!
105
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,550
And I’m going to surpass all
the Hokage from the past,
106
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,390
and make everybody in the town
acknowledge my existence.
107
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:29,860
I’ve been called a failure and such,
but I graduated splendidly and,
108
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,700
as a member of Group Seven
led by Kakashi Sensei,
109
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,170
I am dealing with
difficult missions every day!
110
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,440
Distance from the target?
111
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,170
5 meters.
112
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,510
I’m ready anytime.
113
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,980
In Group Seven, there is also
Sasuke and Sakura.
114
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,680
Since I’m really the only one that shows
great success,
115
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,420
you don’t worry about the other two.
116
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,550
I got you!
117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,320
Don’t say such things.
lntroduce them properly!
118
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,550
Is the target correct?
119
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,060
I know, I know.
120
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,060
The target confirmed.
121
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,800
For example, this guy’s name is
Sasuke Uchiha
122
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,500
and he’s a pretentious guy.
123
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,970
I heard that he’s one of the last
remaining of the famous Uchiha clan,
124
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,840
but he really is a pitiful guy, like this…
125
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,350
Oh, this was when I transform but...
126
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,190
as long as you understand the greatness
of my Ninja skills that’s all that matters.
127
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,560
Oh, and this is Sakura Haruno
who is in love with me.
128
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,700
You know, the more she denies it,
the more I’m convinced it’s true.
129
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,930
She hardly tells me how
she really feels about me but,
130
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,430
her shyness makes her even cuter!
131
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,300
Is that true?
132
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,440
It really is true, true.
133
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,110
Who’s in love with Naruto?!
Cha!
134
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,610
It was a lie after all!
135
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,320
I’m sorry…
136
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,920
Well, putting that aside,
three of us formed a team
137
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,060
and got through a bunch
of dangerous missions together.
138
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,760
Hey you…
139
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,560
What?
140
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,730
Oh, Missus!
141
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,140
I’ve gotten rid of all the weeds!
142
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,070
What? 					What's wrong?
143
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,780
Those…those aren’t weeds…
144
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,940
Huh?
145
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,750
Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
146
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,350
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
147
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
Somebody! Help…!
148
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,060
No!
149
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,570
Free Fall!
150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,540
You idiot.
151
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Trap Field
Do Not Enter
Don't go over there!
152
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,380
Hey! 					Please stop!
153
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,550
That fool…
154
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,550
Geez... All because he
stubbornly chose that big dog.
155
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,460
This is a dangerous mission?
156
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,230
It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto.
157
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,530
Yikes !
158
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,630
Well, there were times like that too.
159
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,140
Do it over.
160
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,940
Transform!
161
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,180
Oh, this was when I defeated
the Old Man Hokage.
162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,420
This isn’t going to make a good article.
163
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,520
Fine, then you show me how to do it.
164
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,230
Fine! My name is Konohamaru…
165
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,000
The grandson of the
town’s chief Hokage.
166
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,430
Grandfather is the most important figure
in the Leaf Village
167
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,530
and is the third Hokage.
168
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,980
Those who succeed the Hokage name
is the top Ninja of the village.
169
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,550
Especially the 4th Hokage is a great hero
who protected the village
170
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,550
from the demon fox!
171
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,650
Hey, hey, hey wait!
172
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,090
You’re only talking about other people!
173
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,560
I was just about to start on myself!
174
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,930
Besides, Bro, you talk too much
about yourself!
175
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,600
Of course, I am the star of the article,
other people don’t matter!
176
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,070
You’re right, Naruto…
177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,840
Of course, you’re going to forget
about me
178
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,540
when you graduate from the academy.
179
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,550
But you can introduce me for a bit…
180
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,050
Oh, yes, yes…
181
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,550
He is the first person in the town
who acknowledged me, Iruka Sensei…
182
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,560
He’s a really nice person,
183
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,220
he always treats me to
ramen noodles at Ichiraku.
184
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
Am I just a nice person because
I treat you to ramen noodles?
185
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,430
Oh no…well…that’s…
186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
Don’t laugh it off!
187
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,100
Big brother, next up,
I’m depending on you!
188
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,540
Oh, you’re right!
189
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,510
Then, I guess I could talk
about Sasuke’s stories of failures…
190
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,050
I’ve already heard that one.
Get more serious!
191
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,550
That Naruto…!
192
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,490
I bet he's just making up
stuff as he pleases…
193
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,220
Humph!
194
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,420
Who cares…
195
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,390
This is good-looking Kakashi.
196
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,600
How is the situation over there?
197
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,400
This is cute Sakura.
198
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,000
Naruto is somehow managing
to fill up the time.
199
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,400
More importantly, how is it over there?
200
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,540
Are we going to make it in time?
201
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,310
We’ll be able to deliver by the
end of the commercial break, I think.
202
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,550
Oh and don’t forget to tell
the viewers about the present.
203
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,310
Roger that.
204
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,990
Kakashi Sensei…
Kakashi Sensei, please respond.
205
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,720
I wonder what happened?
206
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,860
He said that he’d be back by
the time the commercial ended.
207
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,560
It can’t be helped.
Sakura, you have to continue.
208
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,260
What, me?!
209
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,570
Sakura do your best!
210
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,500
Why are you there?!
211
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,070
Well, it can’t be helped,
I guess I’ll have to do it.
212
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,550
Chapter of Ninja Art
213
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,550
Well, now we’ll have Sakura Haruno,
214
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,720
who is my senior as a Kunoichi,
teach us about Ninja Art.
215
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,230
Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi,
Sakura Haruno.
216
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,390
Beautiful?
217
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
What, you have any complaints?
218
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh, no…
219
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,570
Transform!
220
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,100
Well first, Naruto’s Ninjutsu...
221
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,170
Sexy Jutsu,
222
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,310
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
223
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,550
Shadow Clone Jutsu.
224
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,550
Transform!
225
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,020
- Transform!
- Transform!
226
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,520
- Transform!
- Transform!
227
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,460
Harem Jutsu…
228
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,940
I call it, “Harem Jutsu”!
229
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,670
And something like this.
230
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,540
Hey!
231
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,540
It’s his fault that he’s late!
232
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,090
Dropping the blackboard eraser…
233
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,160
Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke,
234
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,530
who graduated as
the top student at the academy.
235
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,560
You won’t get me by attacking
straight on.
236
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,900
The most popular one in class, he can
also fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal.
237
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,570
Sasuke is awesome!
238
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,810
Your Sasuke introduction
is taking too long.
239
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,550
Naruto, you're so noisy.
240
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,220
Stay quiet.
241
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,220
Horse!
242
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,580
Tiger!
243
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,350
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
244
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,020
What?!
245
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,390
That’s not a Jutsu Genin can use…
246
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,930
He couldn’t have enough Chakra!
247
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,010
Demon Wind Shuriken
Windmill of Shadows.
248
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,620
Shuriken won’t work on me.
249
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,360
I’ll do it.
250
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,430
C-Could that be…?
251
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,100
Sharingan!
252
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,570
Is that, the Sharingan…?
253
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,540
If this is the same Kekkei Genkai
as Kakashi Sensei’s…
254
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,140
he can read Bushy-Brow’s Jutsu!
255
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,550
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…
it’s some kind of magic either way.
256
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
I’ll reveal that!
257
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,130
Although you have seen Sasuke
using powerful Jutsu like
258
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,940
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu,
Demon Wind Shuriken,
259
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,540
Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan,
260
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,780
the greatest of all is...
261
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,150
the sharp look of his eyes!
262
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,460
Any girl who has been stared
at with those eyes,
263
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,230
will fall in love with him!
264
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,100
Sasuke! 					Look this way!
265
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,170
You’re... annoying.
266
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,970
Well, that cold behavior is also
another attractive quality of Sasuke…
267
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,550
Next is our teacher,
Kakashi Hatake Sensei,
268
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,850
also known as
the Copy Ninja Kakashi.
269
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,090
He uses the Sharingan in his eye
to assess the enemy’s technique
270
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,560
and copy over
a thousand Jutsu techniques.
271
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,440
But he’s always late to meet people,
and whenever he has any time
272
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,840
he always reads this questionable book
called Make-Out Paradise,
273
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,570
and he always looks like he
doesn’t really care about things…
274
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,840
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu:
275
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,050
A Thousand Years of Death!
276
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,960
And the biggest mystery of all
is his face hidden under that mask!
277
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
I wonder what he really looks like…
278
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,800
Ninja Art, Summoning,
Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
279
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,320
If you can’t use your eyes or ears,
simply use your nose.
280
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,790
That’s what happens when
you’re closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
281
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,560
This is the Summoning Jutsu
specialized for pursuit.
282
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,940
On top of all that, why does he
have the Sharingan in his left eye
283
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,170
that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan?
284
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,680
One mystery after another when
it comes to this person,
285
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,440
so many things that I don’t understand…
286
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,850
I should ask him next time
I have the chance.
287
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,820
Lightning Blade!
288
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,090
What the…?!
289
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,560
His hand is…
visibly overflowing with Chakra!
290
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,400
You are too dangerous.
291
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,540
Water Prison Jutsu.
292
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,540
Oh no!
293
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,540
Secret Jutsu.
294
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,550
Crystal Ice Mirrors!
295
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,690
Next up are the Ninjutsu of
the other Ninjas besides us.
296
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,430
There’s such a diverse collection of
Ninjutsu that I have no time to explain all…
297
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,800
Chapter of Rivals
298
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,540
Please, Sasuke,
whom I feel is like my future self,
299
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,110
take care of the next part.
300
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,880
Sure. After all, I have be the one
to do something about it.
301
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,050
I knew that from the beginning.
302
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,320
Don’t try so hard to look cool.
303
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,750
Sasuke, the snob.
304
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,220
Don’t interfere.
305
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,230
Stay out of it, loser.
306
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,560
Annoying.
307
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,560
Shut up!
308
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,370
I hate the fact that only you stand out.
309
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,010
Nobody strong around you
shows any interest in you.
310
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,670
What the…?!
311
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,540
Just watch this.
312
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,010
Hey!
313
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,510
You there…
What’s your name?
314
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,520
I’m Gaara of the desert.
I have an interest in you as well…
315
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,090
What’s your name?
316
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,560
Sasuke Uchiha.
317
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,490
Hey, you there.
ldentify yourself.
318
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,730
Dang it!
Again? It's always about Sasuke!
319
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,540
When asking someone his name,
give your own name first.
320
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,970
You, with the unpleasant look.
321
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,540
Wait a minute!
322
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,180
Why don’t you fight with me here now?
323
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,490
I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow.
Believe it!
324
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,690
The one I want to fight isn’t you…
lt’s Uchiha.
325
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,060
Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke!
lt's annoying!
326
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,090
It’s true!
327
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,500
Nobody thinks that you’re
the main character leader!
328
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,540
That’s not true, they’re all just blind!
329
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,010
Huh… As usual you’re just about
the talk and not the walk.
330
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,710
That’s not true!
331
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,510
Leaf Whirlwind!
332
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,050
See, you are just about the talk.
333
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,880
Uhh… even Sakura is picking on me.
334
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,220
The students who gathered for
this Chunin Exam are all skilled,
335
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,820
and are the cream of the crop…
336
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,300
Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,
lno Yamanaka,
337
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,770
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru,
and Shino Aburame…
338
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,010
You won’t never be able to win
with the way you have been fighting.
339
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,210
You must understand that, right?
340
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,680
Y-Yeah! Of course!
341
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,150
You, too. Be careful not to let
your guard down
342
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,220
so you won’t be defeated
by some lame guy!
343
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,920
Huh! Of course!
344
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,390
That’s right…
345
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,560
We passed the first stage
of the Chunin Exam and
346
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,860
are heading to the location
of the second stage…
347
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,740
No matter what kind of adversity
may lie ahead,
348
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,100
we will not be afraid!
349
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,640
And we will pass the exam
to become a Chunin!
350
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,050
Because we... we...
351
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,550
have the greatest teamwork
that was formed by a strong bond!
352
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,920
Okay! Let's go!
353
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,760
Thank you so much for cooperating
with the interview!
354
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,130
– Thank you… 					– Leader!
355
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,800
Do your best!
356
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,770
Yeah leave it to me!
357
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,970
– Bye! 					– See you!
358
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,340
– Do your best!
– Good luck!
359
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,050
Oh guys… I’m sorry I’m late.
360
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,850
A cute girl started talking to
me on the way, and I danced for a bit.
361
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,550
And that’s a lie!
362
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,690
Well, don’t say that…
363
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,560
I did bring the VTR like I said.
364
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,960
You have to praise me.
365
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,860
Yes, Kakashi Sensei you’re great!
366
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,500
Now we can see the rest of the show!
367
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Everybody look forward to it!
368
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,900
Oh, before that the commercial break…
369
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,010
Hey, can you hear it?
370
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:33,250
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
371
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,760
The ocean spans limitlessly
372
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:51,130
Please keep that smile on your face forever
373
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:58,070
Or else I’ll cry
374
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,950
You won't have to search around you
375
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,550
It’s all ok now.
376
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:14,560
Everyone is inside
this hand
377
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,900
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
378
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:24,470
When you forget what happiness is
379
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,270
Just sing.
380
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,540
Light is born, and darkness was born
381
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,850
The two are one
382
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,320
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
383
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,820
Hey, can you hear it?
384
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,570
The 44th Training Field,
also known as the Forest of Death.
385
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,240
From here on it’s a serious battle
between the Ninjas,
386
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,470
anything could happen!
387
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,410
It’s going down in earnest now!
388
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,980
This is getting interesting!
389
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,350
A life-risking survival game in the forest!
390
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,250
I will survive without fail!
391
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,550
Next time: “The Chunin Exam Stage 2:
The Forest of Death!”
392
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,420
As for me, I’m going to kick butt again!
//%
1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,150
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,060
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,130
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,930
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,100
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,380
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,980
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,910
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,340
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,180
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,620
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,350
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,690
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,090
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,350
I like your determination!
20
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,190
Then…
21
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,160
For those who are still here…
22
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,890
The first test...
23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,130
you have passed it!
24
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,410
You’ve passed through the gates!
25
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,010
The first test for the Chunin Exams
has been completed…
26
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,250
I wish you well.
27
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,980
All right! Wish us well!
28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,820
What a funny guy…
29
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,580
Huh…
30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,310
I didn’t think that there would be
a guy who would pass the first test
31
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,510
with a blank test sheet.
32
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,350
Naruto Uzumaki.
He really is a funny guy.
33
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,650
The Chunin Exam Stage 2:
The Forest of Death!
34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,330
There’s something kind
of creepy about this place.
35
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,870
This place is called the Forest of Death,
you’ll soon realize why.
36
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,570
“The Forest of Death,
you’ll soon realize why.”
37
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,880
That kind of threat won’t work
on me one bit!
38
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,210
I’m not scared!
39
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,550
Really?
40
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,980
You’ve got a lot of energy.
41
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,590
A kid like you dies at very beginning,
42
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,300
dappled with the red blood I like.
43
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,380
I’m returning your…Kunai Knife…
44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
Thank you for taking the trouble…
45
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,420
But…don’t stand behind me,
thirsty for blood.
46
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,090
If you don’t want a quick death…
47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,800
Well, it’s my nature to act up
at the sight of red blood.
48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,670
And my precious hair was cut,
so I got excited…
49
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Naruto…
50
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
I’m sorry…
51
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,250
W-What with that Proctor?
52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Frankly, she’s psycho!
53
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,390
This one, too…
54
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,560
That girl, why was her tongue so long?
55
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,500
Evidently, we’ve got
a lot of hot-blooded kids this time.
56
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,430
This will be fun.
57
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,200
You’re the most hot-blooded! Believe it!
58
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,180
Well, before we start the second exam,
I have to pass this out to you!
59
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,550
It’s a consent form,
60
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,960
before you can take part
in the test you have to sign this.
61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,930
Why?
62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,900
From here on out,
corpses are going to come out,
63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,560
I have to get your consent to that!
64
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,570
Or it’ll be my responsibility.
65
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,710
Well, I’m going to start
the explanation for the second exam.
66
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,550
In a word, the limits of
your survival will be challenged.
67
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,520
Survival, huh?
This test is a total pain.
68
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,000
First, I’ll give you step-by-step instruction
on the terrain of this Training Field.
69
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,600
Training Field Number 44 is surrounded
by 44 locked entrance gates,
70
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,270
there are rivers and a forest
and a tower in the middle.
71
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,610
It’s about 10 kilometers
from the towers to the gate…
72
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,980
In this confined area, you will
go through a certain survival program.
73
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,820
The contents of which are…
74
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,230
anything goes scroll battle!
75
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,130
Scroll…?
76
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,100
Yes…
77
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,800
I want you to fight for two scrolls,
the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.
78
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,880
All together 26 teams got
through the first test.
79
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,750
Half of them...
80
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,380
13 teams get the Heaven scroll,
the other half get the Earth Scroll.
81
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,090
I’ll hand over one scroll to each team.
82
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,560
To put it simply,
that’s what you’re vying for.
83
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,560
And the conditions to pass?
84
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,770
Three of you bring both the Heaven and
Earth Scrolls to the tower in the center.
85
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,140
That means that of the 13 teams,
half of them will fail for sure…
86
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Except it has to be in time.
87
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,310
For this second exam,
the time limit is 120 hours.
88
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,010
Do it in exactly five days!
89
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,120
Five days.
90
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,720
What do we do about food?
91
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,190
Be self-sufficient! It’s a treasure trove
in the wilderness.
92
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,190
There’s more than enough for food…
93
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
However…
94
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,560
It’s teeming with
fierce people-eating animals,
95
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,560
poison bugs, poisonous weeds and
much more.
96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
No way…
97
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,530
Fool, that’s why it’s called survival!
98
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,510
Besides, it’s improbable that 39 people,
13 teams will pass.
99
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,710
The interval for activity gets longer
with passing each day,
100
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,510
while the time for recovery
gets shorter…
101
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,550
Seems pretty grueling!
102
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,820
On top of that, you’re surrounded
by nothing but enemies,
103
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,560
even falling asleep
will be a problem…
104
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,960
And, besides those injured
during attempts to capture scrolls…
105
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,200
there will definitely be people
106
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,170
are unable to endure
the rigors of the course.
107
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,300
Umm…so you can quit in the middle of it?
108
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,310
According to the rules,
you cannot give up in the middle of it!
109
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,840
I want you to spend
five days in the forest.
110
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,250
Just like I thought…
111
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,880
This is going to be a pain!
112
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,520
Moving on, conditions of disqualification.
113
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,820
Number 1, if all three members
of the team can’t make it to the tower
114
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,030
with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls
within the time limit.
115
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,230
Number 2, if a team loses a member
or if a member became incapacitated.
116
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,970
There’s that, and this is a supplement…
117
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,770
Absolutely do not look at
the contents of the scrolls
118
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,880
until you have reached the tower!
119
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,810
W-What happens if we look
at it halfway through?
120
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,250
When you look at it you’ll find…out!
121
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,550
Huh?
122
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,330
There are times when a Chunin
must deal with super-secret text.
123
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,490
This is to test your reliability.
124
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,930
That’s all the explanation!
125
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,570
I’ll exchange your three consent forms for
the scrolls in that hut over there.
126
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,340
After that, pick your entrance,
and all the gates will open simultaneously!
127
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,440
Finally, just a word of advice…
128
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,480
Don’t die!
129
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,540
I see, so you won’t know which
scroll was given to each team…
130
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,550
and you won’t know which of
the three people is carrying the scroll.
131
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,380
If what Ibiki said was right,
132
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,590
there will be life or death
struggles for information in this test.
133
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,020
Everyone is an enemy!
134
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,100
The resolve of everyone here is strong.
135
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,430
That means that it might come
to killing each other.
136
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,540
It looks like they understand the meaning
of the consent form a little bit…
137
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,680
Heeey, look who’s here!
138
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,350
It’s Billboard Brow, isn’t it?
139
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,360
I thought you went home long ago,
I never imagined you were still here.
140
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,030
Ooooh? Look who’s here,
the ugly Inopig.
141
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,960
Starting now, it's five days of
the survival test with Sasuke.
142
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,570
There’s no reason to go home.
143
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,970
– Ugly! 					– Billboard!
144
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,010
– Ugly! Ugly!
– Billboard! Billboard!
145
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,540
– Ugly, ugly, ugly!
– Billboard, billboard, billboard!
146
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,480
– Billboard, billboard, billboard!
– Ugly ugly ugly!
147
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,540
– Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly!
– Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!
148
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,550
Sakura, this is impossible for you.
149
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,150
For your own sake,
just hurry up and go home!
150
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,550
I could say the exact same thing to you!
151
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,900
Hey, why are those two
on such bad terms?
152
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,600
D-Do you think I care about
something stupid like that?
153
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Man…all there is to do
is write my name,
154
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,470
why does it take this much time!
155
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,480
Hey! Hinata! What are you
doing over there?
156
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,410
N-Naruto…
157
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,550
Umm…uhhhh…well…
158
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,820
Just like I thought,
this kid is strange.
159
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,560
A scratch…
160
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,230
Uh-um… this…is--
161
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
See ya!
162
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,770
Naruto…
163
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,070
It’s about time for
the scroll exchange.
164
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,260
Well, I wonder how
many teams will survive…
165
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,070
Teams who have
taken the scroll,
166
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,140
stay with the representative
and move to the gate!
167
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,210
We’ll all start simultaneously
in 30 minutes!!
168
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,560
Yeah! Survival is our forte!
169
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,190
Hinata, don’t show your weakness.
170
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Uh, okay…
171
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,570
Life or death…
172
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,300
It’s a pain but we just have to do this.
173
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,840
Since it’s come to this,
Naruto will be our target.
174
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,210
For snacks, there’s potato chips...
175
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,840
– What about shortcake...?
– I can’t believe you two!
176
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,880
Okaaaay! I won’t lose!
177
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,720
I’ll bring down whoever comes near me.
178
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,250
– Yes! 					– Cha!
179
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,130
Heh heh…finally the opportunity is here…
180
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,860
We have the chance to fulfill
our mission in earnest…
181
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,110
Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,
182
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,610
I’m really scared of spending
five days with this guy.
183
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,550
Target the rookies first.
184
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,550
They said that from now on
it’s okay to kill,
185
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,020
which makes it easier.
186
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,460
Master Guy, I’ll do my best!
I’ll definitely succeed!
187
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,550
We now start the second
test of the Chunin Exam!
188
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,220
Look for the brats!
189
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,920
Those three, right?
190
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,560
All right! Let’s go!
191
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,170
Okay! First, we search for that thing.
192
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,800
Can you do it, Hinata?
193
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,810
Yes.
194
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,310
Byakugan!
195
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,680
Slow down, Lee!
We just started.
196
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,420
I know. But…
197
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,260
I can’t stay still!
198
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,190
Who knows what kind of
powerful foe is waiting for us.
199
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,560
Hot-blooded fool…
200
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,370
As you already understand,
we have only one target!
201
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,880
W-What are you doing, Choji?
202
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,390
Just a little break…
I’m already tired, and hungry…
203
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,530
What are you suddenly saying?!
204
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,430
It hasn’t been five minutes
since we started!
205
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,270
But I can’t help it. I’m hungry…
206
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,240
You! If you were able to bring snacks,
207
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,010
you should have been able
to bring one Kunai knife!
208
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,180
Ino! Hide!
209
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,960
Uh-oh!
210
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,840
This kind of thing continuing
for five days…?
211
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,080
Anyway, the tower is the
goal for everyone, right?
212
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,460
So it would be clever for us to make
a trap in the vicinity of the tower.
213
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,760
Okay…wasting no time, huh?
214
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,500
Where are they?
215
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,370
Heh…kids.
216
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,900
It’s like begging to be found,
standing in that conspicuous place.
217
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,470
They sensed our presence,
218
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,340
but, evidently they haven’t
grasped where we are.
219
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,680
What happened? 					You’re pale.
220
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,720
W-What is that?!
221
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,760
The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village
sense body temperature and perspiration,
222
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,730
then in mass, swoop down
on their prey.
223
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,770
If they continue to suck
your blood for five minutes,
224
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,100
you go to the other world…
225
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,640
Using this behavior,
226
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,440
we’d set a trap on the path
enemies would use to escape.
227
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,450
D-Darn it…
228
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,850
That’s one team gone!
229
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,470
It sounds like they’ve already started.
230
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,140
Wasn't that someone screaming
just now?
231
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,550
I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
232
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,420
I-It was nothing. Sakura.
Believe it!
233
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,060
I-I have to pee…
234
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,360
Y-You…fool!
235
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,330
What are you doing
in front of a lady!
236
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,800
Go to the grass!
237
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,140
Aaah, that was a lot!
I’m refreshed.
238
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,210
Like I said, not in front of a lady--!
239
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,550
S-Sasuke… no matter what,
you don’t have to go that far.
240
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,220
W-What was that for…?
241
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,570
What are you doing…all of a sudden?!
242
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,740
What you ask? That’s my line, isn’t it?
243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,940
Sasuke!
244
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,540
It can’t be helped!
245
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,820
Sasuke, please stop!
246
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,690
Look closely at him!
247
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,430
Talk! Where’s the real Naruto!
248
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,430
I have no idea what
you’re talking about!
249
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,970
What happened to the scratch
on you face?
250
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,210
I’m asking what happened to the scratch
you got before from the Proctor!
251
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,380
And your Shuriken holster
is on your left leg.
252
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,350
That guy’s right handed!
253
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,550
You’re worse at transformation
than Naruto, you phony!
254
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,960
Unlucky! You got me.
ln that case…
255
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,630
Which one of you got the scroll?
256
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,100
If you listen to me obediently,
I’ll spare your lives.
257
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,680
I see! Then I’ll resort to force!
258
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,560
Hey, can you hear it?
259
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:32,600
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
260
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:42,350
The ocean spans limitlessly
261
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:50,550
Please keep that smile on your face forever
262
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,560
Or else I’ll cry
263
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,500
You won't have to search around you
264
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,070
It’s all ok now.
265
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:13,880
Everyone is inside
this hand
266
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,480
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
267
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,820
When you forget what happiness is
268
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,590
Just sing.
269
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,100
Light is born, and darkness was born
270
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,430
The two are one
271
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,640
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
272
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,380
Hey, can you hear it?
273
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,850
Aww, stupid gas mask man!
274
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,020
Suddenly sneaking up on someone
when they're peeing!
275
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,060
I messed up just a little bit.
276
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,560
Now I have to hurry and
meet up with Sakura.
277
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,990
Wait a minute!
What is this giant snake?
278
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,630
Hey! Are you serious?!
Wait a minute, hey!
279
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,570
I've been gulped down!
280
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,170
Next episode: "Eat or Be Eaten:
Panic in the Forest"
281
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,270
Will I return to action?!
//%
1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,290
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,060
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,120
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,690
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,690
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,690
Now
12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,040
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,310
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,480
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,820
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,230
Where is... this place...?
20
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,680
Who is it?
21
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,950
Me... 					from long ago?
22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,020
Father and mother didn’t need to die!
23
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,000
Everyone was killed.
24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,430
I had no power so...
25
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,100
the clan vanished.
26
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,360
Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!
27
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,730
Ino... Why?
28
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,940
I can’t let you upstage me
in front of Sasuke!
29
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,410
Squirming again...
30
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,880
The Leaf Village worms wandered in.
31
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,480
What are the two of you thinking?!
32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,690
They’re bad news!
33
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,720
It’s a pain, but it can’t be helped!
34
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,590
Ino steps out and
we men should run?
35
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,700
Sorry to get you involved.
36
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,000
But anyway we’re
a Three-Man Squad, after all.
37
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,000
We’re all in this together, aren’t we?
38
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,400
Well, we’ll see.
39
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,770
No! I don’t want to die yet!
40
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,240
Let go of my scarf!
41
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,610
You’re annoying! Quit wiggling!
42
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,810
It’s okay for you to drop out, fatso.
43
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,290
What did that guy just say?
44
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,690
I....didn’t quite catch it.
45
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,690
Huh?!
46
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,890
That word is taboo to Choji.
47
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,700
Try saying it again...
48
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,130
I said if you have a problem,
pull out, fatso.
49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,640
Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso
50
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,640
I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned!
Blast it!
51
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,650
Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!
52
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,820
W-Wow...
53
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,890
All right! You understand this, right?!
54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,760
This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!
55
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,360
Lucky! He’s lost it!
56
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,770
No way, this looks like it’s going
to be a pain in the butt.
57
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,540
That’s my line.
58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,810
I was told to get Sasuke
by the end of the test...
59
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,480
Sasuke...
60
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,480
Sakura...
61
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,550
The two behind...
take care of them.
62
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,020
Okay!
63
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,590
Well then, Team Ino,
let’s go full throttle!
64
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,760
Right!
65
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,100
Formation Ino!
66
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,700
– Shika! 					– Cho!
67
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,670
I’m counting on you, Choji
68
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,800
Okay!
69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,040
Expansion Jutsu!
70
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,670
Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!
71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Human Boulder!
72
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,690
What is this Jutsu?
73
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,950
Isn’t it just a fat guy rolling?
74
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,390
Slicing Sound Wave!
75
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,470
You!
76
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,680
He jumped?!
77
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,120
The air pressure of
Slicing Sound Wave
78
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,050
is less than effective
against that rotation.
79
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,460
Even if I do the Super Sound Wave,
if I’m touched by something like that
80
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,560
the bones in my arms will be crushed!
81
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Think I’ll let you?!
82
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,270
You’re the most annoying so...
83
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,670
Ninja Art!
84
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,240
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
85
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,140
My body!
86
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,840
Huh?!
87
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,690
Dosu?!
88
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,690
What are you doing at a time like this?!
89
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,130
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
90
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,970
Ino, next it’s just the ladies.
91
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.
92
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,070
Gotcha!
93
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,810
Huh?
94
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,780
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
95
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,220
Shoot!
96
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,760
Kin!
97
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,430
What happened?
98
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,040
This... is the end of it.
99
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,310
You guys!
100
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,680
If you make one move,
this girl named Kin is dead meat!
101
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,780
If you don’t want this
to end right here,
102
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,310
leave your scroll and walk away!
103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,780
Once you’ve gone far enough that
I can’t feel your Chakras,
104
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,120
I’ll release this girl!
105
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,660
These guys...
What are they grinning about?
106
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,260
– Choji! 					– Yeah!
107
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,190
This isn’t good! They won’t...!
108
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,470
Ino!
109
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,840
Uggghh. I’m dizzy.
110
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,810
W-What kind of person...
hurts their own comrades?
111
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,680
Careless.
112
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:32,190
Our goal is not the scrolls or
to pass this test playing by the rules.
113
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,230
What?
114
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,990
It’s Sasuke.
115
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,440
Humph...
116
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,970
My Jutsu...
117
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,710
So your much precious
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
118
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,980
is limited to 5 minutes?
119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,350
It’s not Shadow Paralysis.
lt’s Shadow Possession Jutsu.
120
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,520
In addition, it seems that
this girl’s Jutsu...
121
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,090
seems to be a Jutsu to
take over the other’s body.
122
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,590
From the looks of the blood
she’s spitting up,
123
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,260
if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...
124
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,060
Are you going to do in...
your teammate?
125
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,930
If I need to...
126
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,910
This is no good.
127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,480
Shoot...
128
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,680
That’s too bad...
you’re just a step away.
129
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,680
You’re too easy-going.
130
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,620
Hmph, I don’t like this at all.
131
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,060
You minor Sound Ninjas...
132
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,990
Bullying the second-rate guys and
putting on airs like a winner.
133
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,090
What?!
134
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,670
They're Lee’s teammates...
135
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,140
Lee!
136
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,710
You goofed.
137
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,580
Hah! Coming out of nowhere
like cockroaches...
138
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,020
That kid with the bob lying over there
is on our team, but...
139
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,890
But you messed with him, didn’t you?!.
140
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,700
What’s with his eyes?
141
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,400
It’s like they see through everything...
142
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,570
If you’re gonna continue,
I’ll fight with full strength!
143
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,670
Huh?
144
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,910
What ‘s wrong? Neji...
145
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,010
This Chakra...
146
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,980
If you don’t like me,
don’t play cool, come down here.
147
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,290
No. Evidently, there’s no need for that.
148
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
After all...
149
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,310
without power...
150
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,680
I can’t do anything!
151
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,020
Because I had no power...
Everyone was killed!
152
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,230
No...
You let them be killed.
153
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,600
You only... watched.
154
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,300
If only I had power...
155
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,610
If only I had power...
156
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,290
Sasuke! You’re awake...
Huh?!
157
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,560
Huh?
158
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
That’s...
159
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Sasuke?
160
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,650
Sakura...
161
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,740
Sakura...
162
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,280
Who did this to you?
163
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,010
Who is it?
164
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,780
The Curse Marks run
around his entire body?!
165
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,860
Sasuke... 					That body...?
166
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,870
Don’t worry.
167
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,640
On the contrary,
strength is rapidly flowing in...
168
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,240
Right now I feel good.
169
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,980
That guy gave this to me.
170
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,080
Huh?
171
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
At last I understand...
172
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,650
I’m an Avenger...
173
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,220
On my road, I must put power
into my hands...
174
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,530
even if it means abandoning
myself to the devil.
175
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,600
So... I see...
176
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,640
So the mark on the neck
that this girl called Sakura spoke of
177
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,710
is this Curse Mark.
178
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,680
But...
179
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,380
I didn’t think he could stand up...
180
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,780
Sakura, tell me...
181
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,650
Who harmed you...?
182
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,620
Me!
183
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,960
Huh?
184
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,960
Ino!
185
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,600
If you stay like that
you’re gonna get involved!
186
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,360
Come back to this body!
187
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,730
Choji, you too,
come over here and hide.
188
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,270
Y-Yeah.
189
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,800
Uh-oh.
190
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,670
Release!
191
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,210
Okay, she’s back!
192
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,640
Shikamaru!
193
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,980
What’s going to happen now?
194
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,650
How should I know?
195
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,830
Wha--?!
196
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,530
W-What’s this...?
197
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,280
No matter...
198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,780
how you look at it....
199
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,610
his Chakras are...
200
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,780
too big!
201
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,320
Dosu, this half-dead bastard
is nothing to be scared of!
202
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,890
Stop, Zaku! Don’t you understand?!
203
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,860
I’ll take care of all of them...
204
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,730
in one fell swoop!
205
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,700
Super Sonic Slicing Wave!
206
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,120
Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.
207
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,650
– Who did? 					– Huh?!
208
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,960
Zaku!
209
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,830
He’s fast!
210
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,700
Moreover, he took in those two,
and in the blink of an eye.
211
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,800
Fire Style!
212
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,270
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
213
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,240
Don’t push your luck!
214
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,780
I’ll blow them off!
215
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,680
What?!
216
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,680
Shuriken’s in the fire?!
217
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,620
Zaku, below you!
218
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
The quality of the Chakra
is completely different...
219
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,770
Is that really Sasuke?
220
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,670
What happened?
What in the world...?
221
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,280
It seems like you’re
proud of your arms...
222
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,580
You!
223
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,380
S-Stop it!
224
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,520
Sasuke will definitely come for me.
225
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,510
You’re the only one left.
226
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,380
You...
227
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,690
make it a little more fun for me.
228
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,560
This isn’t...
229
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,240
This isn’t...
230
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,580
This is not like...
231
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,980
Sasuke!
232
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,690
S-Stop!!
233
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,960
Stop it.
234
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,610
Please...
235
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,110
Stop.
236
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,630
The Curse Mark is withdrawing...
237
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,900
We’re saved for now.
238
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,670
Sasuke!
239
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,310
You’re strong.
240
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,690
Sasuke... We can’t defeat you
the way you are now.
241
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,160
This is our fee for settling this...
242
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,760
Please let us withdraw from here.
243
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,690
Huh?
244
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,570
It seems selfish, but we now have
something we need to confirm, too.
245
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,010
That being said,
let’s make a promise.
246
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,350
If there’s another opportunity to
battle with you in this test,
247
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,380
we won’t run or hide.
248
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,860
Wait!
249
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,960
Who in the world is Orochimaru?
250
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,760
What did he do to Sasuke?!
251
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,700
Why Sasuke?!
252
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
I don’t know...
253
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,570
We were just given orders to
make the hit on Sasuke.
254
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,110
Though you ordered us to
assassinate Sasuke,
255
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,050
you got to him first.
256
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,220
Moreover, you didn’t kill him,
and left that Curse Mark instead.
257
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,020
I don’t know what you’re thinking...
258
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,570
Hey! Are you okay?!
259
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,570
It’s a pain, but Ino,
I’ll leave Lee to you.
260
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,240
Got it.
261
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,710
That Chakra...
lt’s abnormal.
262
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,520
The Uchiha clan...
this good, huh?
263
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,690
Sakura’s in danger!
264
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,690
It’s okay...
I’ll protect Sakura.
265
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,390
Well, what should we do
with this guy?
266
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,690
Kick him awake?
267
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,700
Can I do it?
268
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,970
What am I...?
269
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,670
Sasuke...
270
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,030
Hey, can you hear it?
271
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:32,440
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
272
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:42,110
The ocean spans limitlessly
273
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:50,490
Please keep that smile on your face forever
274
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,960
Or else I’ll cry
275
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,260
You won't have to search around you
276
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,800
It’s all ok now.
277
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:13,680
Everyone is inside
this hand
278
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,050
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
279
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,650
When you forget what happiness is
280
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,590
Just sing.
281
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,860
Light is born, and darkness was born
282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,200
The two are one
283
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,640
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
284
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:47,140
Hey, can you hear it?
285
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,250
Hey, what’s up Akamaru?
286
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,450
Wait a minute, Naruto,
he’s acting strange.
287
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,690
What, are you hungry?
288
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,560
Doesn't seem like it.
How about a walk?
289
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,930
I know. You’re looking for
an electric pole, aren’t you?
290
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,100
He bit me!
291
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,300
Next pisode: “Akamaru Trembles:
Gaara’s Cruel Strength!”
292
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,610
What in the world do
you want, anyway?
//%
1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,500
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,490
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,490
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,950
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,490
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,120
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,500
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,160
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,700
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,750
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,370
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,620
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,830
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:19,580
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,450
I won’t count on you.
16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,490
I will go by myself.
17
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,290
Wait. 					I 'll go too.
18
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,620
I promised Hinata that I would definitely
protect you, Princess!
19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
With Hinata…?
20
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,870
She fought with the second Janin
and got hurt badly…
21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,040
Hinata did…?
22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,580
You guys said that you didn’t accept
the mission of protecting me.
23
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,450
Then why do you concern
yourselves with me…?
24
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,490
I…
25
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,490
Not only me,
but Hinata and Choji, too.
26
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,790
We don't like it when somebody before us
is hurt or sad… That's all.
27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,040
Well, let’s go!
28
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,700
If we pass through
the valley ahead of us,
29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,080
we’ll get to the town.
30
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,250
If we do that,
31
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,660
they probably won’t chase us
all the way there!
32
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,620
Forecast: Death!
Cloudy with Chance of Sun!
33
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,950
Too bad, but you guys won’t
be able to reach that village.
34
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,200
Since you guys are going
to die here!
35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,160
Wh-Why is he floating in the air?
36
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,700
Hey kid, I bet a low-class Ninja like you
can’t even imagine my Jutsu.
37
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,370
Take this!
38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,750
Naruto!
39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,490
I’m okay.
40
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,500
But what just flew at me?
41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,490
Don’t waste your time fighting me.
42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
I have already captured
all three of your friends.
43
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,160
What?
44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
Just hand over the girl.
45
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,490
If you do that I’ll spare your friends.
46
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,160
Choji and Hinata…
47
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,950
So, what are you going to do kid?
48
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,160
Naruto… Are you going to
abandon me too?
49
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,490
Oh no, this princess is
telling you to save her,
50
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,490
and let your friends die.
51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,910
Well, I don’t mind that kind of thinking
since it’s the same as mine.
52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,490
Same as yours?
53
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,160
That’s right.
54
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,870
If someone is useful,
55
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,040
then you should make use
of them
56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,290
even though they may be
your siblings.
57
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,410
There is one thing I need
to thank you guys for.
58
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,910
Thank us? 					For what?!
59
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,500
For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.
60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,830
I was going to put an end to them myself
sooner or later anyways.
61
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,490
What…?!
62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,790
It was clear that they would
soon tell me,
63
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,950
“Big Brother, give us the property
and the money too.”
64
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,370
Three feudal lords are not necessary
in one country.
65
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,080
And you still call
yourselves brothers?!
66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,000
It doesn’t matter.
67
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,910
Even though it’s my parents
or my brothers.
68
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,200
I'll make use of anything I can.
69
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,620
Now, give her to me.
70
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,160
I refuse.
71
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
I see.
72
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,200
Naruto…
73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,200
A person who would abandon
his siblings
74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,490
would never keep his promise
with me.
75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,490
Well, that’s true.
76
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,290
It’s impossible, Naruto!
77
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,160
You don’t even know
what kind of Jutsu it is!
78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,870
That doesn’t matter!
79
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,540
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
80
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,490
Take this!
81
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,490
What is this guy?
82
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,290
There’s something hard around
his body that I can’t see…
83
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,000
Naruto!
84
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,750
I'm sorry, but none of
your Ninjutsu work on me.
85
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,250
Not even one.
86
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,830
Damn it!
87
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,830
What?!
88
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,620
What is that?
89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,490
Crystallized ice…?
90
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,700
I can gather water vapor in the air
91
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,290
and instantly turn it
into crystallized ice.
92
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,660
So the things that just attacked me
were ice Shuriken.
93
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,750
Man! It’s hard to see
if it’s transparent ice.
94
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,950
Just that is not too interesting.
95
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,950
What is this great sense
of danger?
96
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,790
I’m sure his Jutsu has already started!
97
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
Where is it, where is it
coming from?!
98
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,200
Kid, do you know
today's weather forecast?
99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
Weather forecast?
100
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,910
Cloudy and partly sunny.
101
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,490
It’s a good weather for you to die.
102
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,500
What is this?
103
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,500
What?!
104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,700
Look out!
105
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
Damn it!
106
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,000
Naruto!
107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
That’s a lens!
108
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,160
Lens?!
109
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,250
Yup, I turned the crystallized ice
into lens
110
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,790
to gather the sunlight and shoot it.
111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,330
So, I can’t really control it,
but it’ll be an instant when you die.
112
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,490
As soon as the battle condition
at the Land of Green is prepared,
113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,200
I’ll burn up the surrounding countries
with this Jutsu.
114
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,490
This way!
115
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,620
It’s no use.
116
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,500
I could even see things that are
a thousand miles away.
117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,490
I found you.
118
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,250
Naruto… Why do you protect me?
119
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,830
I wonder why…
120
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,450
I don’t know either.
121
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,660
Naruto…
122
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,790
Haruna!
123
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,790
While I distract him, run!
124
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,490
Don’t even think you guys
could get away from my Jutsu
125
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,490
by doing that!
126
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,330
You decided to hand me
over the princess?
127
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,500
Who would hand over Haruna
to the likes of you!
128
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,490
What a fool.
129
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,830
I’m telling you that if you hand me
the selfish princess
130
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,620
and just go back to the village,
I’ll let your friends go.
131
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,490
I promised with Hinata that
I will save Haruna!
132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
Just to keep a promise
with your friend,
133
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,120
you’re gonna risk your life to fight
in a hopeless battle, huh…?
134
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,490
You’re just like the feudal lord
in Land of Green.
135
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,370
A good-natured big fool!
136
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Same as my father…?!
137
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,160
You’re just like the feudal lord
in Land of Green.
138
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,370
A good-natured big fool!
139
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,700
Same as my father…?!
140
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,910
This is what the feudal lord
foolishly said
141
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,540
to us who were trying to take over
the Land of Green:
142
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,660
“Please do not torment the people
in this country.”
143
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,250
I beg you!
144
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,200
I don’t care what happens to me,
145
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,080
but please promise me one thing!
146
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,830
This is a small weak country
surrounded by big countries.
147
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,120
Without the powers of the people,
the country cannot prosper!
148
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,160
In order for the country to prosper,
149
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,450
we must take care of
each individual people
150
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,160
and not sacrifice a single life!
151
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,370
I want you to consider the people
as a family
152
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,490
and not torment them.
153
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,490
I am the feudal lord!
154
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,160
It doesn’t matter what I do
to the people, right?
155
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,410
That’s why…
156
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,080
That's why this country has
been at peace until now!
157
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,410
Peace doesn’t matter to me.
158
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
All I need to do is use the people
as the stepping stones
159
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,160
and feather my nest!
160
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,490
And because of that kind
of good nature,
161
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,490
his daughter was taken
as a hostage!
162
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,450
What do you mean?!
163
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,870
It seems like it was ten years ago.
164
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,700
A lot of the people were sacrificed
by the pressure of the big country…
165
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,120
Riots occurred in the country
and the country came close to corruption.
166
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,500
It was a bitter decision…
167
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,250
I had no choice but to let
my daughter,
168
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,700
who is more important than my life,
taken as a hostage.
169
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,080
I know that Haruna will
not forgive me…
170
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,660
A cold-hearted father who sacrificed
his own daughter
171
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,540
just for the peace of the country.
172
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,490
Why don’t you ask
your daughter directly?!
173
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,330
In the after life!
174
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,490
My father was…killed!
175
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,410
What an outrageously
good-natured person, huh?
176
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,700
You’re wrong,
he was a great feudal lord!
177
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,700
Naruto…
178
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,830
Listen!
179
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,490
There are two kinds of human beings
in this world.
180
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,500
Those who use others,
and those who get used!
181
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,490
In my case, I will get to
the top using anyone,
182
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,490
whether it’s my parents or my friends.
183
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,490
You! I’ll never forgive you!
184
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Shut up!
185
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,580
D-Damn…!
186
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,490
Die!
187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,790
Naruto…
188
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,490
You can’t move anymore?!
189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,450
You’re not the one…
190
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,040
It was because of Haruna’s father
that this country was peaceful…
191
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,540
The person who is going
to succeed this country is…
192
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,490
The person is…
193
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,870
Haruna!
194
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,500
Stop!
195
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,490
Stupid!
196
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,080
Why aren’t you running away?!
197
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,250
Kill me! If you kill me,
your goal will be fulfilled, right?!
198
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,950
Naruto, Naruto has nothing
to do with this!
199
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,790
So both the parent and daughter
are naïve, after all.
200
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,540
Why not complain to your father
in the afterlife
201
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,160
for making you sacrifice your life
for the country?
202
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,330
How scary…
203
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,830
Y-You!
204
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,540
It’s time for you to die, kid.
205
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,250
I’m not a kid!
206
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,490
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
207
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,830
I’m not going to hand over
the Land of Green
208
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,830
to a person like you!
209
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,490
Naruto!
210
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Die!
211
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,870
What?!
212
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,620
No…way…
213
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,490
But kid, it’s too late even
though you took me down…
214
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,660
The Land of Green without
a feudal lord will collapse
215
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,330
due to the war between
the large countries over its territory.
216
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,490
It’s too bad,
but that’s not gonna happen!
217
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,580
Shizune!
218
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,700
It’s a pain,
but we came to get you guys!
219
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,080
Shikamaru!
220
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,160
But…I didn’t ask you guys
to come get us!
221
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,910
But you look pretty beaten up.
222
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,290
No no, this is…
223
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,080
Naruto!
224
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,080
Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!
225
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,330
Everyone was safe!
226
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,370
Yeah.
227
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,790
We were rescued by
the people of Leaf Village.
228
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,830
Huh? Oh yeah,
why are you guys here?
229
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,660
We received notice of a coup
in the Land of Green
230
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,290
and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me
to come…
231
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,500
Princess Haruna’s father was
very kind to Lady Tsunade and me.
232
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,250
My father…?
233
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,660
Please forgive us, when we arrived,
your father was already…
234
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,490
I see…I’ve caused
so much trouble for you.
235
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,200
Damn!
236
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,950
The position of the feudal lord
that I finally got a hold of…
237
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,750
But, then the surrounding countries
are not going to stay quiet.
238
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,490
It’s okay.
239
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,660
An announcement has been sent out
to the neighboring countries
240
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,000
in the name of the next feudal lord.
241
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,620
Under your name, Princess Haruna.
242
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,750
Then we don’t need to worry about
the country getting attacked anymore!
243
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,580
Haruna!
244
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,660
Haruna…
245
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,490
Do it.
246
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,040
You want to take revenge
with your own hands, right?
247
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,250
I’ll do the same if I were you.
248
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,750
I am…not like you!
249
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,490
Haruna…
250
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,490
Kikunojou, please forgive me.
251
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,450
Princess Haruna.
252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,830
Here, Kikunojou could look over
the Land of Green.
253
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,410
I'm sure that Kikunojou
will watch over everyone forever.
254
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,290
Well, Lady Haruna,
we are leaving now.
255
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,910
Thank you, Naruto, Choji,
and Hinata.
256
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,040
Shizune, I’d like to ask a special favor.
257
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,080
What is it, Princess Haruna?
258
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,080
My role is to take over my father’s will
to protect the peace of Land of Green.
259
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,620
In order to do that,
260
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,620
I want to borrow some help
from the Leaf Village.
261
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,950
Our help?
262
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,080
Yes.
263
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,540
I want you to lend me Naruto.
264
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,450
Huh?!
265
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,910
Please, Naruto.
266
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,490
Princess Haruna.
267
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,490
I want you to help me
with the revival of the Land of Green.
268
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,490
I…I…
269
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,120
I’m sorry,
but I can’t really do that.
270
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,910
I need to go back to my friends.
271
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,370
And I need to do more training
and become much stronger.
272
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,500
There are things that I must do.
273
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,870
It’s all for my precious friends!
274
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,410
Then I can’t take you away
from them…
275
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,040
Naruto, I’ll promise that I will do
my best to keep my father’s wishes
276
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,870
and strive for a peaceful country
where no one will be sacrificed.
277
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,700
Yeah!
278
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,370
It’s a promise!
279
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,660
Thank you! Naruto!
280
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,370
Good-bye! Everybody!
281
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,490
We’ll come back someday!
282
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,490
Bye!
283
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,290
See ya!
284
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,370
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
285
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,950
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
286
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,490
Yellow Moon.
287
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,490
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
288
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,500
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
289
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:10,490
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
290
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,490
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
291
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:24,290
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
292
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:31,000
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
293
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,580
A magical chord change, in a restless city
294
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,620
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
295
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,000
No! He’s looking over here!
296
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,790
Of course, he’ll look!
Stop complaining and attack him!
297
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,200
No, no, it’s impossible!
298
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,490
He just moved right now!
He moved, Naruto!
299
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,870
Of course, he’ll move!
Hey, approach him more!
300
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,160
No, no, no. This is my limit.
301
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,120
Come on, just give him
a one good hit!
302
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,830
No, the enemy is that thing you know?
303
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,330
A monster, a monster!
304
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,490
This wouldn’t be a mission!
305
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,450
Next time:
“Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!”
//%
1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,450
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,250
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,370
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,660
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,200
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,830
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,450
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,870
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,490
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,490
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,080
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,490
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,540
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh!
16
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,450
Sorry, sorry.
17
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,870
Was that some eagle poop
just now?
18
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,160
Nothing there, huh?
19
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,330
Well, I worked up a sweat,
20
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,540
so I guess I’ll go home
and take a shower.
21
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,330
A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:
The Onbaa!
22
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,660
I worked up
a good sweat today too.
23
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,540
What’s the deal, Akamaru?
24
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,500
He says you smell bad, Naruto.
25
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,620
Are you making sure
to take a bath?
26
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,120
Don’t be saying rude things!
27
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,370
No, you seriously stink.
28
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,490
Come to think of it…
29
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,080
The poop from the eagle
a moment ago might…
30
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,410
Sakura.
31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,160
Oh, I found a slacker
who can’t get a mission!
32
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,490
That’s just…
I’m not that much a slacker!
33
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,750
So it seems. You must’ve done
some reckless training.
34
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,950
It’s ripped.
35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,750
Huh? You’re right. I didn’t notice!
36
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,490
It can’t be helped.
37
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,490
Bring it to me later.
I’ll sew it up for you.
38
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,700
Really?! Really?! Really?!
39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,750
Sakura, you’re such a nice person.
40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,120
It’s the first time in my life…
you’ve been this nice to me!
41
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,870
H-Hey, Naruto. You’re exaggerating.
42
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,870
Naruto!
43
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,500
Wh-What’re you doing, Sakura?!
44
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,870
You touched my breast
just now, didn’t you?!
45
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,250
I didn’t do anything like that!
46
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,750
Then, what’re those hairy hands
sticking out from your armpit?!
47
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,750
What’s…that?
48
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,330
Huh? Huh?!
49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,290
Wh-What’s this?!
50
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,540
Your back.
51
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,490
Huh?
52
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,370
Wh-What in the world is this?!
53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,870
It’s a huge poop!
54
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,750
Idiot! That’s some kind of creature!
55
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,410
Is it a caterpillar?!
56
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,250
What?! Get it off.
57
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,910
No, this is an animal.
58
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,040
Let go!
59
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,080
Give me a break.
60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,490
You guys, have you ever heard
of the legend of Onbaa?
61
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,830
Onbaa?
62
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,790
I’ve never heard of it!
63
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,790
Shizune! You don’t know?
64
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,000
Nope. Is that legend something like
an old tale or something?
65
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
That’s what I thought, but…
66
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,830
Long ago when I was young,
I heard about a legend…
67
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,160
A legend about a dangerous,
hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa
68
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,040
who lived deep in the mountains
near the village…
69
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,490
One day, that idiot Jiraiya
eagerly went into the forest
70
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,490
saying he was going to investigate
the Onbaa
71
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,580
for his summer vacation
independent research.
72
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,450
The Pervy Sage?
73
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,660
Yes…
74
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,330
Are you an idiot?
75
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,490
Do you seriously think
there’s an Onbaa?
76
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,490
Well, you’ll get yours when
you see my independent research!
77
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,490
Who would?
78
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,160
Even if there were an Onbaa,
it wouldn’t deal with you…
79
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,870
You said it! Flat-chested girl!
80
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,490
Who’s flat-chested?!
81
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,620
No way is there such a thing
as an Onbaa!
82
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,950
You wanna bet on that?
83
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,660
Yeah! I’ll bet!
84
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,330
Then, I’ll bet on Jiraiya.
85
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,490
Huh?!
86
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,620
Then, I’m off to wrestle
with an Onbaa!
87
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,490
And? Did the Pervy Sage
meet an Onbaa?
88
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,490
When he came back three days later,
89
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,370
he said he won with
a force-out move…
90
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,750
which most likely was a lie.
91
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,830
Oh! here it is.
92
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,000
Huh? What’s this?
93
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,080
What lousy writing!
94
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,370
You’re one to talk, Naruto.
95
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,200
Let’s see… The Onbaa is big.
lt is nine-feet tall.
96
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,700
The Onbaa is scary.
97
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,660
No one is a match for it
when it gets mad.
98
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,660
But I beat it at wrestling.
99
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,580
What’s this?
100
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,290
The Onbaa’s child likes
being carried piggyback.
101
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,080
They grow up on the parent’s back.
102
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,040
What?!
103
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,370
What Jiraiya wrote is bogus,
tracing the legend as is, but…
104
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,080
So there was an Onbaa…
105
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,490
Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,
106
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,490
it stays piggyback on my back
and won’t get off.
107
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,450
What should I do?
108
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,330
According to legend,
the child Onbaa considers
109
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,490
the first thing it sees after birth
as its parent
110
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,080
and clings to the back
of that person.
111
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,750
It seems they grow that way,
piggybacked on the parent,
112
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,870
until they become an adult.
113
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,950
It seems until then,
they never leave the parent’s back.
114
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,160
Then, there’s no other way
but to wait until it grows up.
115
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,370
You say that, but when it grows up…
116
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,330
it’ll turn into a scary
nine-foot tall monster, right?
117
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,410
What’s up with
that straightforward reaction?
118
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,160
Well, it’s a legend,
so it’ll probably get off eventually…
119
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,490
Don’t be so irresponsible!
120
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,410
H-Hang in there, Naruto…
121
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,790
We’ll be cheering you on
from behind the scenes.
122
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,490
Come up close rather than
behind the scene, damn it!
123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,160
What is it?
124
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,490
I won’t lose, you know!
125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,490
This isn’t a weight, man!
126
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,830
What is it, Hinata?
127
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,500
Naruto… I heard a strange rumor.
128
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,750
A strange rumor…you say?
129
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,290
That you…umm…had a child.
130
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,660
Oh. You mean this?
131
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,120
Huh?! Hinata!
132
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,790
Hey! You okay?! Hinata!
133
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,540
Hinata, Hinata!
134
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,500
Hinata?!
135
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,490
What’s the deal?
You’re sure an extravagant guy…
136
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,910
Oh!
137
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,250
Am I going to have to take a bath
every time he pees on me?
138
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,500
Ichiraku Ramen
139
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,790
You know, we don’t allow pets.
140
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,330
The Leaf Village public health
department is strict, you see.
141
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,870
I missed dinner because of him.
142
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,490
Overlook it just for today.
143
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,000
But now that I look closer,
he’s cute, isn’t he?
144
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,870
So, what’s his name?
145
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,040
He’s saying it himself,
so I guess Onbu is okay.
146
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Onbu, huh…?
147
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,870
Doesn’t he want to eat
some Naruto fish cake?
148
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,410
Here.
149
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,580
Old man!
Give me a whole roll of Naruto!
150
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,620
Coming right up!
151
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,000
Ever since you clung to my back,
152
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,160
I’ve been getting nothing
but odd jobs like this.
153
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,490
Well, I guess it can’t be helped…
154
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,580
He’s gotten big…! And so quickly…
155
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,950
This is bad!
156
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,490
Naruto Uzumaki,
you are assigned a mission
157
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,490
for the removal of the mountain bandits
from Yamabuki Pass!
158
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,080
Removal? Hey old lady…
159
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,830
Onbu’s gotten big,
160
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,540
so you intend to get rid
of the troublemaker, right?
161
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,490
N-No, it’s not like that.
162
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,500
I was thinking you’ve had
some eye-opening growth recently, so.
163
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,700
Then, what about the other members?
164
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,830
No…
165
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,330
Since you’ve shown
such remarkable growth,
166
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,910
a solo infiltration should be fine.
167
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,370
Sure enough,
it’s getting rid of the troublemaker!
168
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,490
This is also fate…
Okay now, back to work.
169
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,830
Thanks, mister!
170
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,790
N-Naruto, Naruto.
171
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,490
Things are fun when
you’re around, Onbu!
172
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,290
That Grandma Tsunade.
173
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,700
Don’t think you were able to
get rid of the troublemaker so easily.
174
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,040
I’ll beat the mountain bandits
and finish up this mission lickety-split
175
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,490
and the two of us will return
to the Leaf Village with pride!
176
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,490
Right, Onbu?!
177
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,450
Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!
178
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,040
Who’re you, creep?!
179
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,370
Who’re you?!
180
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,490
What do you want?!
181
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,490
I’m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!
182
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,700
Prepare yourselves!
183
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,000
– Say what?! 					– Get him!
184
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,410
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
184.01	02:29:44:16	02:29:45:10	Onbu!
185
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,040
Even knowing it’s a clone…
186
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,040
I won’t forgive those who hurt Onbu!
187
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,910
Heh! How was that?!
188
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,870
Die!
189
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,950
Onbu! You saved me!
190
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,950
Onbu… I owe you my life.
191
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,660
Let’s get back to the village quick
and surprise everyone!
192
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,120
Onbu! No way will I believe that
you’re a dangerous creature!
193
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,490
We’ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team
succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!
194
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,580
What was that?
195
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,620
It’s okay…
196
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,870
You’ve got me with you.
197
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,040
Onbu?! No, it’s huge!
198
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,490
Could it be…you’re after Onbu?
199
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,250
Are you Onbu’s mom?!
200
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,160
W-W-W-Wait! I didn’t steal him!
201
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,870
Onbu! Say something, will you?!
202
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,620
Y-You idiot, Onbu!
203
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,490
No, y- you’ve got the wrong idea!
204
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,000
Onbu, it’s your mom.
205
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,250
It’s not my intention!
206
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,700
Damn it! I had a rough time of it.
207
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,250
If you're a mother,
208
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,370
then take better care
of your child, really!
209
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,830
It’s okay! I’ll return Onbu to you!
So rest easy.
210
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,580
Huh? My body got light.
211
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,080
Huh? Onbu? You got so big!
212
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,950
Huh, wha--?
What’s the matter, Onbu?!
213
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,330
What’s the deal?!
214
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,250
W-W-W-Wait… Onbu, it’s me!
Can’t you tell?!
215
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,750
We were getting along
so well just a moment ago!
216
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,950
Please remember me!
217
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,040
It’s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!
218
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,660
Oh, yeah! Naruto!
219
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,080
Naruto! Naruto!
220
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,500
Onbu, look at this!
221
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,250
Remember!
Remember this spiral!
222
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,500
Naruto, Naruto!
223
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,490
You remember my back you clung to
the whole time, don’t you?
224
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,250
Have I…had it?
225
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,500
Onbu…
226
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,790
I’m tired…
227
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,500
This feels kind of good…
228
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,700
It’s like I’m being carried piggyback.
229
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,620
Onbu…
230
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,620
Onbu!
231
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,000
Live in good health with your mom.
232
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,580
All right!
233
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,580
My sides…are splitting!
234
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,580
Onbaa is now no longer a legend.
235
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,120
They’re thriving in the village forest
and seriously proliferating.
236
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,870
The stupid eagles carried them in, so.
237
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,500
Naruto! How’d you tear it off you?!
Tell me!
238
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,870
Who knows?
All I did was wrestle with Onbu.
239
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,540
Don’t be so mean!
240
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,830
At this rate,
the village will be crushed.
241
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,120
Tell me! Naruto!
242
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,000
Don’t look at me.
243
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,580
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
244
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,410
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
245
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,910
Yellow Moon.
246
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,750
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
247
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,950
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
248
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,910
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
249
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:17,790
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
250
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,500
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
251
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:31,450
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
252
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,040
A magical chord change, in a restless city
253
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,080
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
254
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,370
Shino and I have been
sent to a certain village to deal with
255
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,500
a dispute over a family head
who passed away.
256
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,490
An old woman suddenly appears
on the road and says this to us.
257
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,870
“Even dead men laugh
in Motoyoshi Village.”
258
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,160
They were mysterious words.
I never imagined it at this time.
259
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,080
To think I would see with
my own eyes,
260
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,490
a sight in this village too frightening
to even talk about…
261
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,490
Next: “Laughing Shino.”
262
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,830
I can’t even go to the bathroom
alone at night.
//%
1
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,950
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:29,860
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,160
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,320
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,490
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:53,030
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,910
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:05,030
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,200
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,870
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:28,860
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,450
But thank goodness
your injury wasn’t serious.
13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,990
Naruto was relieved, too…
14
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,530
The rumors were true…
15
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,200
That the survivor of the Village’s
honorable Uchiha Clan
16
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,780
was the most good-for-nothing kid…
17
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,780
Sasuke, you must be hungry.
ls there something you want to eat?
18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,910
I’ll go buy something for you.
19
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,870
The Battle Begins:
Naruto vs. Sasuke
20
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,740
To be honest,
I really don’t understand.
21
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,160
It seems there were opinions that,
22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,570
with the final exam being suspended,
23
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,570
no one should pass
this time around.
24
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,620
But I hear the late Third Hokage
highly praised your match.
25
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,990
It seems he intended to recommend you
for Chunin.
26
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,780
The lords of other lands
who observed the fight
27
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,910
and the proctors were of
the same opinion as well…
28
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,950
In that case, it’s not in my place
to say this or that about it.
29
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
From now on,
30
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,240
strive to perform in a manner
that is worthy of that headband…
31
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,410
Congratulations!
As of today, you’re a Chunin!
32
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,860
– Wow… 					– Wow!
33
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,200
Even you who’s never motivated
look respectable.
34
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,700
It doesn’t suit you.
35
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,870
Don’t laugh, I say…
36
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,860
For the time being,
37
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,320
let’s have a toast to celebrate
Shikamaru’s promotion to Chunin!
38
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,620
Let’s eat!
39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,820
Oh! Choji!
40
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,620
Don’t eat the meat before the toast!
41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,990
But, it’d be a waste if it got burned, so…
42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,700
There’s a lot of meat. Eat up!
43
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,990
All right!
44
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,530
Right now,
I have no interest in you…
45
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,740
Your target is Naruto, after all.
46
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,200
You’ll end up in the hospital again, Choji.
47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,860
Don’t you know how to savor the taste?
48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Never mind!
49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,860
Even if I eat a lot,
I know how to savor properly.
50
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,860
Hey! Choji, that’s the last piece of meat
that I’ve been grilling!
51
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,490
The last bite!
52
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,070
This is the conclusion and
53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,740
will become the meat with
the greatest value that should be savored!
54
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,660
I won’t hand over
this last bite to anyone!
55
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,860
What’re you acting cool for,
you idiot?!
56
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,490
Everyone makes fun of you
because you’re like this!
57
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,280
– You’re just a fa--
– Ino!
58
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,240
That’s a taboo word!
59
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,910
But really, Choji…
60
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,280
A meal isn’t a battle.
61
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,450
Relax at a time like this at least.
What a pain.
62
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,860
Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed…
Too lazy…
63
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,030
I wonder if these guys
will be okay from here.
64
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
In particular…
65
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,070
Choji. With you it’s nothing but food.
66
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,240
Do a little training sometime!
67
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,030
Choji…
68
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,530
You’re lucky that your mind
doesn’t restrict what you eat…
69
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,620
I’ve got it rough with a diet.
70
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
Why do you have to diet, Ino?
71
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,910
Girls want to be seen as cute as possible
by the one they like!
72
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,320
But that person might not always
like a thin person.
73
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,240
In the first place,
most boys don’t like fa--
74
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,530
Not that… They like thin girls.
75
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,860
And, vice-versa.
76
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,370
You should be a little more conscious
of your body, Choji.
77
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,740
You won’t be popular.
78
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Heh… She doesn’t get it.
79
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,870
Men don’t like thin women
as much as women think.
80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,570
More likely men who like chubby women
are the most common.
81
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,570
And, vice-versa…I’d say.
82
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,120
I bet she’d be twice as popular
83
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,120
if she were to gain a little more weight
instead of dieting.
84
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,160
You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.
85
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,870
And you’re smart, too.
86
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,570
Hmm?
87
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,570
I know it in my heart…
88
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,700
You’re much more awesome
than the likes of Sasuke or Neji.
89
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,870
Well, I’ve never even thought about that.
I’m me, so…
90
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,120
But you’re the only one
who became a Chunin
91
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,570
in the Chunin Exam this time…
92
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,120
But you might be better
at fighting, right?
93
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,120
I might’ve given up if
I’d gotten into one with you.
94
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,860
But earlier,
Sensei told me that all I do is eat
95
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,410
and that I’m not progressing…
96
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,660
I’m me, I tell you. And you’re you.
97
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,990
It’s stupid talking about how which is.
98
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,160
Well, don’t worry too much
about what Asuma says…
99
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,860
You should live naturally
and take things easy.
100
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,620
See you later! I’m going home.
101
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,570
My dad’s starting to say
some troublesome thing
102
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,370
like he’s going to teach me
a new Jutsu or something.
103
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,860
Shikamaru.
104
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,620
Hmm?
105
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,240
What?
106
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,370
Good luck with your training.
107
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,370
Yeah.
108
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,240
You’re a good guy…Choji.
109
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,620
Hey, Sakura!
110
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,860
Naruto!
111
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,370
The time is right…
112
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,780
Head for the Leaf Village, now!
113
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,160
I see… You’ve made up your mind, huh?
114
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,070
Yes!
115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,280
I’m carrying out fitness training
to get ready for the surgery.
116
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,620
I want to return as soon as
I can after the surgery, so…
117
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,120
Oww!
118
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,860
Ow-ow…
119
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,780
Lee…
120
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,370
Yes?! What is it?
121
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,990
You won’t die
if you give up being a Shinobi.
122
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,950
Why are you so fixated
on being a Shinobi?
123
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,950
My everything is proving that
even I can become a fine Ninja…
124
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,530
You might die. Even if you succeed…
125
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,410
Even so…
126
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,410
I promise you!
127
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,780
That’s my dream, so…
128
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,370
Why…do you snap this much
at the mention of Hokage’s name?
129
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,280
Unlike you…
130
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,620
I will be the heir to the name
of Hokage, no matter what!
131
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,370
Because, Hokage is my dream!
132
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,410
In this village, promising children
are being brought up.
133
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,200
Sarutobi Sensei… Sure enough,
you were a wonderful Hokage.
134
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,860
The surgery is in the afternoon.
Get ready!
135
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,740
Let’s go, Lee! Are you prepared?!
136
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,700
Yes!
137
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,070
I got some apples…
You like them, right?
138
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,450
Here, doesn’t it look good?
139
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,990
Huh…? I wonder where I put the knife…
140
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,860
It’s right in front of you, believe it.
141
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,820
It’s so lame, you getting all scatterbrained
just because you’re in front of Sasuke.
142
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,990
I’d rather hear lame
from anyone but you…
143
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,990
Naruto…
144
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,030
U-zu-ma-ki!
145
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,660
Naruto 2K Barrage!
146
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,030
Knock it off already!
147
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,860
Summoning Jutsu!
148
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,860
I will…protect Sakura!
149
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,620
I-I give up, believe it…
150
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,280
Sasuke… Thank you.
151
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,660
You rescued me from
the Sand Ninja, right?
152
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,740
No...
153
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,860
The person who rescued you…
was Naruto.
154
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,280
You are weak.
155
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,530
Why are you weak…?
156
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,620
It’s because you don’t have enough…
157
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,120
...hate.
158
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,570
Good. I peeled it nicely.
159
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,950
I’ll cut it to make it easy to eat, and…
160
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,860
Here, Sasuke.
161
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,950
Ow! What happened?
162
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,910
S-Sasuke?
163
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,820
Huh? What’s going on?
164
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,990
Wh-What?
165
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,860
Y-You don’t have to glare
at me like that.
166
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,860
Hey, Naruto…
167
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,570
Wh-What is it?
168
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,410
Fight me… Right now!
169
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,860
What?! Here you are,
just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.
170
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,320
What’re you saying?
171
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,860
Just fight!
172
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,370
Sasuke…
173
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,700
You think you saved me?
174
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
I don’t care if she’s the Fifth Hokage
or whatever, but…
175
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,860
she should’ve just minded
her own business!
176
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,240
What?!
177
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,660
You said you wanted to fight me, right?
178
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,950
I’m saying let’s do it now!
179
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,030
Or have you chickened out?
180
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,450
S-Sasuke. Hey…
What’s going on?!
181
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,780
Naruto, you say something too!
182
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,530
What’s this all of a sudden?
183
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,070
This is perfect, believe it!
184
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,200
I was just thinking
I wanted to fight you!
185
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,660
S-Stop it, the both of you… Okay?
186
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,570
Come with me!
187
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,910
What’s…this feeling?
My lower belly feels tight…
188
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,030
I want to fight you, too.
189
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,860
And… I feel a thrill.
190
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,530
What’s so funny?
191
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,860
Nothing’s funny, believe it!
I’m happy!
192
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,450
When I think
I can finally beat you here!
193
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,410
Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priority
of our organization, Akatsuki.
194
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,070
What did you say?
Don’t talk foolish, you failure!
195
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,990
I’m not going to be
a failure forever!
196
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,700
Right now,
I have no interest in you…
197
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,490
You… A loser like you better
not act all high and mighty!
198
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,160
Hah! It’s unlike you to lose
your cool and raise a fuss.
199
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,530
So uncharacteristic.
200
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,570
It couldn’t be that you picked a fight
and then got scared, could it, Sasuke?
201
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,160
Just bring it, now!
202
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,570
Put on your headband before that!
I’ll wait.
203
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,820
I don’t need such a thing…
204
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,490
Just do it!
205
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,820
You wouldn’t even be able…
to put one knick on my forehead!
206
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,320
You’re wrong!
207
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,370
I’m saying this is a testament to fighting
on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!
208
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,740
And I’m saying stuff like that
is acting high and mighty!
209
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,280
Do you think that we’re equal?!
210
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,860
Yeah, I do! I’ve never once
thought that I’m inferior to you!
211
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,990
You’re an eyesore!
212
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,870
That’s because you remain weak!
Little Sasuke!
213
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,870
Naruto!
214
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,860
Sasuke!
215
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,160
Don’t be getting carried away!
216
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,910
Naruto…
217
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
Enough already, believe it!
218
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,200
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
219
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,740
U-zu-ma-ki!
220
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,490
Naruto Barrage!
221
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
The Tiger Seal!
222
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,490
Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!
223
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,030
N-Naruto!
224
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,490
Wh-What is that Jutsu?!
225
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Damn it!
226
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,860
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
227
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,860
S-Stop…
228
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,780
I’ll win no matter what!
229
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
Don’t flatter yourself!
230
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,320
Stop it, both of you…
231
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,450
Stop it!
232
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,860
Once in a long while, once in a while
233
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,530
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
234
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,820
Look like a mountain
235
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:58,950
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
236
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,780
The remnants of a person crying
237
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,740
Look like a mountain
238
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,410
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
239
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,240
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
240
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,570
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
241
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,820
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
242
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,910
Look like a mountain
243
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,160
Look like a mountain
244
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,860
Look like a mountain
245
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,990
Look like a mountain
246
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,780
After becoming a Three-Man Squad,
though we had fights,
247
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,570
we carried out our missions together.
248
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,280
And yet, both Sasuke and Naruto
have steadily gone on ahead
249
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,820
and only I've been left behind.
250
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,160
Say, Sasuke, I feel you at a distance
even though you're this close.
251
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,410
No matter what,
I can't see you, Sasuke.
252
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,860
Next time:
"Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds"
//%
1
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,830
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,330
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,120
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,450
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,700
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,990
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,370
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,990
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,330
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,330
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,870
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,200
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,040
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,870
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,120
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,990
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,290
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,950
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,250
Because they want to change something
20
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,160
Funeral March for the Living
21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,990
Wh-Why…
22
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,080
Why does such
a good man have to…die?!
23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,290
It’s sad… 					lt’s so sad!
24
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,580
I remember now…
25
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,200
I forgot when,
but you showed it to me, didn’t you?
26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,870
With a twinkle in your eye,
27
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,330
you proudly said it was
a memento of your father.
28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,990
That was the pipe box, wasn’t it?
lt was an amazing box.
29
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,330
No wonder you’re so proud of it…
30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,660
Even though I took it and smashed it,
you only laughed.
31
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,870
You were smiling when
we kicked you and tossed you.
32
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,990
It was a great smile.
33
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,160
Really…
34
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,990
Hold it in, Rokusuke!
They’ll all be gone.
35
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,910
If we let this moment go,
36
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,000
there will be no other chance
to get out of the village.
37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,580
But Kanpachi is…!
38
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,160
It’s for the village,
39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,410
we have to do something and
make our way to that village!
40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,410
Yeah…
41
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,540
Funerals are awesome, aren’t they!
42
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,580
I wanna do that again.
43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,830
One…two…three people…
got away again…
44
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,990
Looks like we can have
another funeral.
45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is…
46
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,410
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
47
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
You are…?
48
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,910
Naruto Uzumaki! Right now,
I’m in the middle of training.
49
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,910
The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
50
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,540
H-Hey! I said hey!
51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,990
Hang in there!
52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,200
This is training too…!
53
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,700
I can’t give up yet! Not yet!
54
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,990
The escort for the ruler of
the Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,
55
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,830
was completed without incident!
56
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,990
Well done.
57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,990
That’s Lady Tsunade’s…!
58
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,080
Excellent dumplings are always
from the Leaf Village, aren’t they?
59
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,370
That was my last one!
60
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,580
Mission Accomplished!
61
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,040
I came to pound the pirates
of the Gottani Channel
62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,290
with the fist of love!
63
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,290
If they take this opportunity
to rehabilitate themselves,
64
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,950
it’s worth while to shed a tear!
65
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,500
I’ll have your team do it for me.
66
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,750
Yes?
67
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,000
Even though we’re already busy,
that Naruto brought in more work.
68
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,990
After this, Guy has the S-rank mission.
69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,700
The client picked him,
so he must depart today.
70
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,500
So, do it without Guy.
71
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,450
That’s pretty straightforward…
72
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,870
I called Neji Hyuga,
Tenten and Lee.
73
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,410
Ohh!
74
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,620
My pupils can undertake the fulfillment
of this mission without incident!
75
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,700
Wait…
76
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,290
Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.
77
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,990
Why can't it just be my pupils,
who are loved by all the world?
78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,990
Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!
79
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,990
It just is.
80
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,790
Hidden Leaf Hospital
81
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,950
Those three people that Naruto saved
came all the way
82
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,660
from the Katabami Gold Mine
to request a mission.
83
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,450
Katabami Gold Mine is one of
the Land of Rivers’ greatest mines,
84
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,080
but about half a year ago, hooligans
calling themselves the Kurosuki family
85
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,000
appeared on the pretext of guarding it,
and took control of the village…
86
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,200
killing villagers for
no particular reason.
87
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,990
How vile!
88
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,370
Your mission is this:
89
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,000
Once those three have
regained their strength,
90
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,990
escort them to Katabami Gold Mine
and eliminate the Kurosuki family.
91
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,290
It’s a simple mission.
92
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,990
Well anyway, it must be a group
of punks who’re after money.
93
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,790
Why did you call me for
such an easy mission?
94
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,910
Who do you think you are?
95
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,660
I’m busy searching for
Sasuke and training, and--!
96
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,120
You forced your way into missions
that you weren’t called for.
97
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,790
It’s not a Genin’s place
to choose his missions!
98
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,660
Would you like to be sent back
to the Academy? Well?!
99
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,370
Neji Hyuga!
100
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,120
Yes!
101
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,540
You’re the leader!
102
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,830
It will be good training for you
to try to tame the unstable.
103
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,990
I don’t want to…
but, I’ll do it!
104
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,200
I’ll go continue my training!
105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,990
Hey Naruto!
106
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,620
Please excuse them.
They have no manners…
107
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,910
Wait!
108
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,370
Those little brats…!
109
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,830
What the heck do
they think missions are?!
110
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,700
Umm, excuse me?
111
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,990
What?!
112
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,370
The Kurosuki Family…
113
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,830
What did you say
their boss’ name was?
114
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,990
Raiga!
115
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,450
That’s what I thought…
116
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,910
What?
117
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,830
Well, on a previous mission,
I heard a rumor about him.
118
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,660
A rumor…?
119
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,990
Pervy Sage hasn’t returned…
I’m forced to go on a mission…
120
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,250
Oh, this is irritating…
121
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,540
Sakura!
122
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,910
Naruto?
123
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,750
What’s going on? A bird?
124
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,200
Yesterday I found it injured
and treated it, but…
125
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,700
Sakura, that’s amazing!
126
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,290
But poor thing.
127
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,990
It’s separated from its friends.
128
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,990
Naruto!
129
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,080
Oh, sorry, did I intrude?
130
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,910
You intruded big time!
131
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,620
No, no!
132
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,120
Don’t turn your back,
no need to grovel to youth.
133
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,580
Sakura, Hello!
134
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,000
Hello!
135
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,660
What did you come here for?
136
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,580
– Just to have a word.
– Huh? What the--?!
137
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,410
Oh, Sakura, goodbye!
138
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,830
– Hey! What was that?!
– She went wild, didn't she?
139
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,120
She should act her age.
140
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,790
Ichiraku
What?! The boss of
the Kurosuki family
141
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,410
is one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist?
142
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,410
Yeah, it’s exclusive information
from our respected teacher, Guy.
143
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,870
Who’re the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist?
144
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,290
Naruto, you said that
145
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,990
you fought in the Land of
the Waves mission, didn’t you?
146
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,990
At that time…
147
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,540
Oh, Zabuza! And?
148
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,910
And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Sensei
fought Kisame Hoshigaki.
149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,040
I heard that
you met them there too, Naruto.
150
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,990
Oh! I know that guy!
151
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,620
Those two were once called
152
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,990
the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist.
153
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,080
And at that time,
who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?
154
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Oh!
155
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,790
The man called Itachi!
And then?
156
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,990
You still don’t understand?
157
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,830
If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist,
158
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,330
then he’s probably tied to Itachi
who was with Kisame.
159
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,700
Oh! And?
160
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,990
Tell me, who's after Itachi?
161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I know! Sasuke!
162
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,000
That’s right!
163
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,120
We can probably get
the clue to Sasuke’s whereabouts
164
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,250
at Katabami Gold Mine!
165
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,620
But…
166
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,990
If that’s what Guy Sensei said then…
167
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,450
Don’t say anything rude!
168
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,990
It's information that's
100% reliable!
169
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,000
Starting now,
while guarding Rokusuke and the others,
170
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,990
we head toward Katabami Gold Mine
171
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,080
to fulfill our mission to
wipe out the Kurosuki family.
172
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,200
There’s a shop I’m familiar
with close to the gold mine.
173
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,990
Let’s make that the base.
174
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,950
What do you mean
a shop you’re familiar with?
175
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,370
That’s the fun part of the trip.
176
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,540
That aside, that Naruto is late…
177
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,080
If the source of the information
is Guy Sensei,
178
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,160
maybe he couldn’t quite trust it?
179
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,580
That’s not true!
Naruto will definitely come!
180
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,910
That’s because Guy Sensei’s
information is correct!
181
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,040
Whatever.
182
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,290
Here I am!
183
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,000
We’re all here so…!
184
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,950
Is that for you to say?!
185
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,990
Let’s go!
186
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,750
So…which way?
187
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,990
Don’t be so anxious, Rokusuke,
188
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,080
Those guys will save our town.
189
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,040
It’s post-meal training!
190
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,120
I won’t lose!
191
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,990
I won’t lose!
192
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,990
How long do you intend
to rest here?!
193
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,080
If we hurry, we can save Kanpachi
from the burial…
194
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,910
Give it up…
195
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,990
How long do you think
it’s been since that happened?
196
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,660
It’s painful but…
197
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,000
I remember…this sleepiness.
The shop is close by.
198
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,120
You say you’re sleepy,
and are you walking in your sleep?!
199
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,450
It’s okay.
200
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,660
I slept while on a marathon on
this road for three days straight.
201
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,120
You are joking, right?
202
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,620
It’s true.
203
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,370
The track meet of my youth
with Guy Sensei.
204
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,990
My body still remembers it.
205
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,160
I’ve gotten sleepy.
206
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,160
Hey, Bushy Brow,
are you really okay?
207
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,620
That’s right. In this area,
there’s the scent of spicy curry.
208
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,540
Curry? Now that you mention it…
209
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,990
That’s right!
210
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,990
Over there, it’s…
the Curry of Life Shop!
211
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,990
Grandma Sansho!
212
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,370
Oh my… 					Oh goodness!
213
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,750
I haven’t seen you for a while!
214
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,330
– Oh my my my!
– You're looking well!
215
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,500
This is the shop Lee is familiar with?
216
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,830
That mountain is
the Katabami Gold Mine
217
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,750
Grandma Sansho’s curry saved my life.
218
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,540
So you’re saying
it’s delicious curry?
219
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,910
No, it really saved my life.
I’m indebted to this curry.
220
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,040
It was when
I’d just become a Genin …
221
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,200
When Guy Sensei gave me
a special training routine.
222
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,790
Oh my, that’s right.
I remember.
223
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,500
Do your best!
224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,990
Oh my…
225
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,450
Hey Grandma Sansho!
226
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,450
Oh my, they’ve come again!
227
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,830
Those people are running in their sleep.
228
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,990
Karashi! Karashi!
229
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,080
If you had that kind of energy,
you wouldn’t lose to the bullies.
230
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,830
Oh my,
I might have said too much.
231
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,990
Curry of Life Shop
232
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,830
Oh my! It’s the third day.
233
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,990
They’ve been running the whole time.
234
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Oh my. What a problem.
235
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,330
I wonder if he’s hungry…?
236
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,620
What a pickle! He's not waking up!
237
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,990
Maybe I didn't use
enough spice?
238
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,120
Karashi…
239
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,080
I’ve never seen a person
who works this hard.
240
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,450
Oh really… so you want to help
this young man too…?
241
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,200
This is the curry of life.
242
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,580
Now! Grandma Sansho went to
the trouble of making this curry.
243
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,000
Let’s eat!
244
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,410
I’m digging in!
245
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,200
Yum!
This is yummy-yum delicious!
246
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,750
Delicious! The use of spices
is wonderful!
247
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,290
And this rice
goes perfectly with the curry!
248
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,990
Delicious!
249
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,410
By the way, I don’t see Karashi.
250
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,950
Karashi saw how hard you worked
251
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,950
and became a bright kid
full of energy, but…
252
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,950
He got too much energy
and left for town.
253
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,660
What?
254
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,750
I was wrong to keep telling him
to be stronger.
255
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,450
“I’m going to be a man!
256
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,660
“I’m going to be part of
the Kurosuki family,” he said.
257
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,620
Oh my! I’m not blaming you.
Don’t worry.
258
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,910
It's too late.
259
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,990
I’m responsible…
260
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh my.
261
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,040
Neji!
262
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Please include Karashi’s rescue
into our mission!
263
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,250
We’ll bring him back from
the road of evil!
264
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,990
It’s fine.
265
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,410
We’ll use this shop as a base
and take a good look into the village.
266
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,660
Then we’ll come up with a strategy
and spring into action.
267
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,580
Yes!
268
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,250
You guys await orders here.
269
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,500
Because it’s dangerous
if the Kurosuki family finds us.
270
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,410
It’s a disaster!
271
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,950
Rokusuke! Rokusuke!
He's gone!
272
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,700
I’m sure he went to town alone!
273
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,870
That’s not good!
274
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,250
If those guys find Rokusuke…!
275
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,040
Now that it’s come to this,
276
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,040
we don’t have time
to come up with a strategy!
277
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,290
Let’s get right to it!
278
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,990
No!
279
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,250
We’ll get right to it!
280
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's hurry.
281
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,700
Wait for me, Kanpachi,
I’m coming now…
282
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,990
Someone… is coming…
283
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,000
Aw, again…
I have to put on a funeral!
284
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,200
Crappy news pass us by
285
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,790
And you become speechless
286
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,790
My voice is way too soft
287
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,990
So you don’t answer
288
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,700
You’re crying   Crying alone
289
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,540
What can I do?   I’m crying too
290
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,000
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”
291
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:07,250
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah
292
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:16,990
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah
293
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:25,990
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah
294
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:37,950
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
295
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,080
You taught me that day.
296
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,200
If you cook with great care,
297
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,950
you can save someone’s life
with just one serving of curry.
298
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,700
Even for a person like me,
299
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,330
with intense effort,
it’s not an impossibility…
300
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,990
That’s what I thought.
301
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,370
You were far more admirable
back then, Karashi.
302
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
But…
303
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,120
Next time: “A Lesson Learned!
The Iron Fist of Love!”
//%
1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,030
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:29,940
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,240
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,400
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,570
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,110
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,990
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,110
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:12,280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,950
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:28,940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,070
I’m counting on you, Choji!
13
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,280
Yeah!
14
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Expansion Jutsu!
15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,650
All right, let’s go!
16
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,450
Human Boulder!
17
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,860
What?!
18
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Choji… You are awesome, after all!
19
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,740
Full Throttle Power!
Choji, Ablaze!
20
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,990
They got away from
my Barrier Ninjutsu…
21
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
He’s the only one here.
22
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,900
Seems like the others went ahead.
23
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,610
Yeah.
24
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,360
They’re not around
here any more.
25
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,400
Damn… Just when we thought
we caught up.
26
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,400
Everybody, you did well…
27
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,320
for some losers.
28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,360
What?!
29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,940
Who are you calling losers?!
30
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,940
Once we’re out, it’s our battle to win!
31
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,650
I-I will do it!
32
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,940
Wait you two!
33
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,940
It’s dangerous to fight them
head on right now!
34
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,070
We tore through the barrier!
We can do this!
35
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,030
Tunneling Fang!
36
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,320
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
37
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,610
– Take this! 					– Take this!
38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,940
You guys are my meal!
39
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,950
Darn it!
40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,530
Shoulder Charge!
41
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,070
Knee Lift!
42
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,860
Not even good enough for an appetizer!
43
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,150
Be careful everyone!
Another tricky one is coming!
44
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,900
Earth Style Barrier:
Earth Dome Prison!
45
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,240
Expansion Jutsu!
46
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,700
Human Boulder!
47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,150
Damn!
48
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,030
Such useless acts…
49
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,400
There’s no time.
50
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,940
We’re going to split into two here!
51
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,280
Why?!
52
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
I see…
53
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,320
Even at 5 against 1,
with our Chakras taken away,
54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,570
he’s not someone we can
easily defeat…
55
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,940
If we take our time,
Sasuke will pass the borders.
56
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,990
If that happens, we won’t be able
to handle this on our own.
57
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,070
So we split up…
one team to stop him
58
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,320
and one to go after Sasuke, right?
59
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,200
Yeah. The sub leader is going
to be you, Neji.
60
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,150
I found them!
61
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,110
Neji! Take Kiba and Choji,
and go after Sasuke!
62
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,200
Got it!
63
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,240
This guy…
64
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,820
Naruto and I will handle!
65
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,940
Are you going to put
the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu on me again?
66
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,320
Such a foolish Jutsu.
67
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,530
I don’t need to see that kind of
street performance more than once!
68
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,490
And who was it that got tricked
by that street performance earlier?
69
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,780
He disappeared?!
70
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Behind us!
71
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,650
Earth Style: Sphere of Graves!
72
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,940
He’s nuts!
73
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,950
Be careful!
There’s another one coming!
74
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,950
You are the platoon leader,
if I’m not mistaken.
75
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,530
You sure do suffer
when you have a stupid leader.
76
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,320
You underlings!
77
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,320
A stupid leader like this…
78
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
I’ll get rid of for you!
79
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,400
Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!
80
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,940
Thanks! Choji…
81
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,070
Why? Wasting my good intentions…
82
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,950
If the leader is stupid,
then I guess the subordinates are losers.
83
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,490
Well… I’ll kill you losers
before you suffer
84
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,940
working under
a glum shadow lover like him!
85
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,820
Darn, darn! Babbling on like that!
86
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,400
I will…!
87
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,320
He’s mine!
88
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,940
I will…take care of him!
89
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,030
Choji…
90
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,610
What are you saying?!
91
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,150
He’s not the kind of guy
you can handle on your own!
92
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,900
I will do it!
93
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
Choji… you…
94
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,700
Shikamaru…
Take these Food Pills for everyone…
95
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,950
Choji… You are not…
96
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,360
That’s right.
I have that secret weapon of mine.
97
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,820
But Choji, that is…!
98
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,610
Huh… Losers, I won’t let you
have your way!
99
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,570
He’s coming!
100
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,740
I’ll get rid of you all here!
101
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,700
Go, everyone!
102
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,860
Pills of three colors?
They’re not Food Pills.
103
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,950
What are they?
104
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,780
First…Spinach Pill!
105
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,990
Get out of the way! Loser!
106
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,940
Impossible… He stopped me?!
107
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,740
Shikamaru, take everybody and go!
108
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Choji…
109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,740
What did we gather for?
110
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,450
If we lose Sasuke,
then we will end up like he said…
111
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,400
The stupid leader and his losers!
112
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,450
You better catch up with us, Choji!
113
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,280
Yeah.
114
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,110
Everybody, go!
115
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,110
All right! Let’s go, everyone!
116
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,530
– Yeah! 					– Right!
117
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,280
Choji…
118
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,530
I’m going to get rid of you quick
and get rid of those guys too!
119
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,530
It won’t be that easy…
120
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
What?!
121
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,940
I will…
122
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,240
…stop you!
123
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,700
A parting gift from Choji…
Eat it!
124
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,570
Yeah!
125
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,860
Thanks, Choji…
126
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,030
Kiba!
127
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,110
Thanks!
128
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,940
Shikamaru…
That pill that Choji took earlier..
129
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,150
It seemed like some sort
of trump card,
130
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,320
but does he have a chance to win?
131
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,940
He said that he has a secret weapon.
132
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,780
He brought the Akimichi clan’s
ultimate secret pills on this mission…
133
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,450
These are the Triad Colored Pills
of green, yellow, and red.
134
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,530
If you take it,
you can gain explosive powers.
135
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,150
The energy that each pill
contains is enormous!
136
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,280
I see! I see!
So that’s why he was so confident!
137
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,570
But…there’s always a side effect
to any pills that work too well.
138
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,940
Damn… I didn’t think it would hurt
so much with just the Spinach Pill.
139
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,610
I hope that Choji can settle it
with just the green pill.
140
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,860
Don’t take the red one,
no matter what, Choji.
141
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,200
I’m going to finish you at once!
142
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,940
Expansion Jutsu!
143
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,450
Spiky Human Boulder.
144
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,240
He raised the rotational
and destructive power
145
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
by using the Kunai Knives as spikes!
146
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,610
Earth Style: Terra Shield.
147
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,570
What?!
148
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,900
I-I did it…?
149
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,940
Yeah. That’s what I was thinking too.
150
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,400
Akamaru… 					What is he saying?
151
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,280
You know that Akamaru
can tell the strength of the enemy
152
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,700
just by the smell, right?
153
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,200
He’s worried if Choji is going to be able
to handle that monster with just the pills.
154
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
True…
155
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,320
If we were to assess
the situation objectively,
156
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,860
that giant’s ability is unknown…
157
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,940
The possibility of Choji being able
to defeat him might be close to zero.
158
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,360
But…
159
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,110
That is how battle is…
160
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,860
Don’t get carried away, loser!
161
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,570
Shatter Palm!
162
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,200
Did you know?
163
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,570
When there’s a group of people
of five or so,
164
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,700
there’s always one loser.
165
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,530
That person is always made fun of…
166
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,780
and when it comes down to it,
167
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,320
they’ll just toss that person
aside like a pawn.
168
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,360
I’m talking about you!
169
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,200
Choji. All you want to do is eat.
You should train some at least!
170
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,070
You get teased because you’re like that.
You’re just a f--
171
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,940
You said somebody exceptional, right?
172
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,860
Shouldn’t we ask Shino or somebody?!
173
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,490
This guy is useless too…
174
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
That is true…
175
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,610
No matter how hard I try on my own…
176
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,990
I…
177
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,780
Seems like I hit it right on the nose.
178
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,940
Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,
179
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,570
seeing that they pick a loser
like you to be on the pursuit team.
180
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,820
Why don’t we finish this up already?!
181
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,940
Knee Lift!
182
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,360
Shoulder Charge!
183
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,990
Huh! You really are a loser to the end!
184
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,820
Your high spirit didn’t last long at all,
only at the beginning…!
185
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,860
You really are the ideal loser!
186
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,990
A loser like you shouldn’t have come
to a place like this!
187
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,110
You should blame your stupid leader
for choosing you!
188
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,940
Shikamaru…
189
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,450
Neji’s right. It’s how a battle is.
190
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,240
From the start, this mission
wasn’t for recreation.
191
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,570
It’s life or death.
192
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,320
Hey Shikamaru…
193
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I already anticipated the worst scenario
194
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,240
in which we would be fighting
separately on our own.
195
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,820
And at this point,
196
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,530
if we’re not prepared for
“one person, one kill,”
197
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,400
we might not be able
to catch up to Sasuke.
198
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Choji is a good guy,
but he doesn’t have the confidence.
199
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,940
He thinks that
he’s the weakest of all of us.
200
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,900
He actually is weak.
Anybody can see that.
201
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,950
That’s why he was the first to
stay behind to try to be useful.
202
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,030
Just as I thought…
203
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
But…
204
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,030
Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,
205
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,150
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.
206
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,610
But Shikamaru…
207
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,610
But, if we fight against each other,
you might be stronger.
208
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,110
I might have given up fighting
against you too.
209
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,070
And you’re you…
210
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,900
But…
211
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,780
Shikamaru…has always…
212
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,740
Shikamaru has always
believed in me…
213
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,200
Choji…are you ready?!
214
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,450
He believed that I was really strong!
215
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,450
That’s why he left it up to me alone!
216
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,110
Just as I thought…
217
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,450
So everybody thinks that…
But…I know…
218
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,320
More than myself or Neji
or any of us here…
219
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,150
He is stronger!
220
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,570
And…I believe it.
221
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,450
Oh? Pretty impressive Chakra.
222
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,650
But…it’s a far cry
from being a main dish…
223
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,570
Let's go, fatso!
224
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,490
Don’t YOU say that!
225
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,610
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
226
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:33,070
Once in a long while, once in a while
227
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,900
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
228
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,950
Look like a mountain
229
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,320
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
230
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,940
The remnants of a person crying
231
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,940
Look like a mountain
232
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,780
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
233
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,610
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
234
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,940
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
235
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,950
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
236
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,280
Look like a mountain
237
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,530
Look like a mountain
238
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,030
Look like a mountain
239
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,360
Look like a mountain
240
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,530
I can't move because of the pain.
241
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,240
I didn't think the side effects
of the secret pill would be strong.
242
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,450
What do I do?
I only have one more pill.
243
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,490
But if I take it, if I take it,
I will…surely…
244
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,940
Next time: "Good-Bye Old Friend!
I'll Always Believe in You!"
245
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,360
Of all people,
I cannot forgive you!
//%
1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,890
To think the Leaf’s reinforcements
will be you of all people!
2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,000
A man should always repay
the debt he owes a woman.
3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,230
Always the bothersome guy with
the man and woman stuff!
4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,000
Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after
the guys who took our village girl.
5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,170
Forget about here and
head for them!
6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,170
We’ve received information.
7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,540
Gaara and Kankuro have entered
their respective battles.
8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,550
I see…
9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,050
The shadow won’t reach, I guess…
10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,760
Leaf Village’s two-man cells are
just now heading there for back-up.
11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,890
How well prepared.
12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,730
It’s a pain,
13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,560
but as long as we’re doing this,
we’ll do it right.
14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,800
We’ll do it perfectly without
producing casualties!
15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,270
Make sure you don’t cry
in front of me this time.
16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,070
Are you going to hold
that over my head forever?
17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,140
Just like a woman…
18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,180
I-I feel like I don’t really
have my place in this.
19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,220
I’ll take care of all of you at once!
20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,550
Here it comes!
21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:29,770
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
22
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,550
The distance created between us
became too big,
23
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,530
because we were always together
24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,570
Your honest reply, “See you…”
25
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,210
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
26
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,810
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
27
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:20,750
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:33,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,800
I can feel it so close,
30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,080
Our two hearts
31
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,090
Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!
32
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,000
To think you’d ask
the Leaf Village for help…
33
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,730
I guess the Sand has lost the edge
they used to have, huh?
34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,470
Why are you here?
35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,110
You know, dogs.
36
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,210
They’re not satisfied until a favor
has been properly returned.
37
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,310
Especially this Akamaru!
38
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,690
A dog retuning a favor doesn’t
have much of a ring to it!
39
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,260
Help is on the way to
the other two as well.
40
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,860
You concentrate on this fight!
41
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,700
You’re giving me lip!
42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,570
So you flies are gonna gang up
on me, huh?
43
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,440
But you’re no match for my Dragon Eye:
Fang Release: Dark Sword.
44
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Eat this!
45
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,890
If your Chakra isn't built up,
your sand is no big deal at all!
46
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,220
It’ll only be useful for
blinding me at best!
47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
It’s futile!
48
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,560
I feel it.
Your Chakra is being sucked up.
49
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,770
What?! He was setting the sand
in the gourd aside?!
50
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,560
I was being cautious,
but he is much too strong.
51
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,470
Gaara Sensei!
52
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,470
Just what I’d expect from
Gaara of the Sand.
53
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,670
He’s not called the ultimate weapon
for nothing…
54
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,540
The ultimate…weapon?!
55
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,610
However, he cannot exceed
our Ninja tools
56
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,210
forged in the Village of the Artisans!
57
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,550
Gaara!
58
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,560
Hey, he’s totally got the edge!
59
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,360
Do we have a chance to
return the favor?
60
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,000
That’s incredible wind.
What an amount of Chakra…
61
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,640
No, it seems that sword is
amplifying her Chakra.
62
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,380
So she’s relying on that sword for
all of her attack and defense, huh?
63
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,050
Anyway, we’ve got to slip within
firing range for our Jutsu
64
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,020
and stop her movements!
65
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,020
Right.
66
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,090
Let’s go at once!
67
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,400
Annoying!
68
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,180
She’s attempting to maintain
her distance just from Temari.
69
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,550
I see.
70
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,380
So she just wants to pay attention
to the long range-type Temari and
71
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,520
blow us mid-range Jutsu users
away with wind
72
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,390
before we can get close, huh…?
73
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,560
Now then, what should we do?
74
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,390
Man Beast Clone!
75
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,230
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
76
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,790
Crow!
77
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,100
– Arms! 					– Fang Over Fang!
78
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,010
Did you guys come to
get in my way?!
79
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,550
We made sure to send you
a signal, right?!
80
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,310
How could I tell?!
81
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,620
We don’t click at all?
82
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,690
Are you guys…messing around?!
83
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
Be more serious and die!
84
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,260
Talking nonsense!
85
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,690
Although I reduced the damage
with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still…
86
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,600
Just what I’d expect of Gaara,
87
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,710
the Sand’s ultimate weapon
who hosts the Shukaku…
88
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,410
But you’re already in our hands.
89
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,200
What should I do?
She’s beyond the range of my Jutsu…
90
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,470
and I don’t see anything around here
that could be used to extend my shadow.
91
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,640
Hey!
92
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,180
What’re you whispering about?
93
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,690
What’re you thinking?!
94
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,690
I’ll explain later, for crying out loud.
Can you do it or not?
95
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,890
I suppose I could try, but…
96
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,300
What is it…?
97
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,980
What’s he doing?
98
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,690
Behold the terror of Ninja tools
our village created.
99
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,420
What’s this Chakra?
100
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,540
This is a water vein!
101
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
I get it!
102
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,550
The lines connecting the point
in the center and triangle isn’t a Barrier…
103
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,680
It’s a water vein!
104
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Ninja Tool Barrier:
Reverse Scale Formation… Activate!
105
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,170
Oh no!
106
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Gaara Sensei!
107
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,550
The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation
was a single point, Gaara from the start!
108
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,850
Our swords accurately pierce
a water vein
109
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,660
and summon the water dragon.
110
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,260
Sand has sucked up
a large amount of water
111
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,690
and has become as heavy as lead…
112
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,560
Now Gaara can no longer use sand.
113
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,670
Gaara!
114
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,670
– Gaara! 					– Calm down!
115
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,770
Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!
116
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,010
That guy is?!
117
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,610
They’ll save Gaara,
no matter what.
118
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,550
We need to concentrate on
the enemy in front of us.
119
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,930
To think you’d choose
a sandy area to fall on…
120
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,360
Just what I’d expect of Gaara
of the desert…
121
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,730
However!
122
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,070
That’s as far as
your useless resistance goes!
123
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,840
Leaf Hurricane!
124
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,120
A hero’s turn always comes late!
125
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,550
That’s right!
126
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,720
Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!
127
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,530
Naruto…!
128
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,560
It seems you rushed to everyone
during the Sasuke incident…
129
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,570
This time we’ve come to return
the favor from that time.
130
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,540
So we’ll take that guy on!
131
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,110
You hurry to your student straight on!
132
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,050
To think he’d corner you this far…
133
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,650
– Lee! 					– Sakura!
134
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,820
Leave Gaara’s treatment to me!
Lee, you go with Naruto!
135
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,060
– Sakura! 					– Got it!
136
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,630
Then I’ll be going first!
137
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,370
Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!
138
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,900
I’ll suck up all of your Chakra!
139
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,980
I see. So this means we can’t
release our regular power?
140
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,610
That doesn’t matter!
141
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,550
Even without Chakra,
we’ve got fighting spirit!
142
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,420
Yes! We’ll go with that
plus willpower!
143
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,570
Just as I thought.
144
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,240
That they haven’t launched anything
during the fight thus far means
145
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,940
the two reinforcements don’t
have long range-type Jutsu.
146
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,610
Then I’ll maintain this distance and…
147
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,440
you’ll die getting torn up by the wind!
148
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,380
While she’s distracted by Shikamaru
and the others,
149
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,520
I’ll just go for it!
150
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,590
Mind Destruction…!
151
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,550
Ino!
152
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,760
Foolish girl. It’s useless to attempt
to exploit an opening!
153
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,890
You little!
154
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,440
You won’t get close to me!
I’ve read your range as well!
155
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,570
I don’t know about that…!
156
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,280
Ino! You stay right there!
157
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,850
I’m counting on you…!
158
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,680
Shino! Sakura!
159
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,560
There’s one wounded
at the waterfall.
160
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,030
Tunneling Fang!
161
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,060
Now!
162
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,900
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
163
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,930
Oh…!
164
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,400
What’re you doing?!
165
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,700
Are you guys…mocking me?
166
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,440
After sucking up all of your Chakra,
I’ll be returning the favor plenty!
167
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,380
The contusion treatment is complete.
168
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,690
But, the depletion of Chakra
is overwhelming.
169
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,960
Contact from your friends…?
170
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,190
– Ino’s hurt?! 					– Go!
171
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,500
Wha--?! But in your condition…
172
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,640
I’m okay now. Help your friend!
173
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,070
Okay. Don’t push yourself.
174
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,070
Yeah…
175
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,150
What’re you doing?!
Hurry up and go after your comrade!
176
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,190
I’ll help my comrade.
177
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,550
I’ll settle this in a moment.
178
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,560
But…
179
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,330
Bushy Brow!
180
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,770
Damn it. It’s no good
just shot-gunning it!
181
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,900
It’s just him?
182
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,880
A part of Black Ant…
183
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,450
Could it be…a signal?
184
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,550
Fang Over Fang once more!
185
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,420
Back me up with Crow!
186
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,220
I’m counting on you
for back up too, Choji!
187
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,520
Got it!
188
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,860
Heh! Bossing me around.
189
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,870
The counterattack starts now!
190
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,500
It’s futile. Your Jutsu won’t reach me!
191
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,570
You never know until you try, right…?!
192
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,080
Here we go!
193
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!
194
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,510
Huh?!
195
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,220
What’re you aiming at?!
Totally misguided…
196
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,820
Say what?
197
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,760
What’s the meaning of this?
198
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,230
I’m sure I’d read your range already…!
199
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,560
I’ll show you!
200
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,570
I can create a shadow with
this thick a current
201
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
even if the water’s clear.
202
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,570
My Jutsu’s range has infinitely
improved by lifting the waterfall!
203
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,550
The Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success!
204
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,550
Summoning…
205
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,220
Blade Dance!
206
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,970
This one’s done!
207
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,470
Good grief…
208
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,210
I…couldn’t do anything.
209
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,050
Here everyone’s doing their best…
210
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,020
Only I…
211
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,420
Ino?
212
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,150
Gaara.
213
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,300
You don’t have any sand
left you can use.
214
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,470
What’s this?!
215
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,970
He smashed the Sand Armor.
216
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,140
No way! But the sand
heavy with water like that…
217
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,440
If I just suck up the Chakra…
218
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,750
This is my weapon!
219
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,730
You okay, Gaara?!
220
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,870
This is the finishing blow…
221
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,540
Gaara Sensei!
222
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,340
Hurry! Leave the rest to us!
223
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,540
Man Beast Clone!
224
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,740
Fang Over Fang!
225
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,550
Partial Expansion Jutsu!
226
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,650
Annoying buzzing flies!
227
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,020
Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!
228
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,730
What?!
229
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,500
Oh, no!
230
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,770
Puppet Show…
231
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,640
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
232
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,850
The show’s  over!
233
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,520
– We did it! 					– Yeah!
234
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,460
Matsuri.
235
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,170
Gaara and…!
236
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,530
A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.
237
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,970
He’s heading for the valley.
238
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,440
The last one…
239
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,610
Gaara is chasing him!
240
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,540
What?!
241
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,220
You okay, Bushy Brow?
Sakura will be right back.
242
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,490
Thanks.
243
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,550
Well, I’m going after Gaara!
244
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,390
Got it! I’ll meet up with you later!
245
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,400
I’ve got him cornered.
246
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,620
Matsuri.
247
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,260
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
248
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,570
Will always be smiling right near by
249
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,440
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
250
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,950
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
251
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,850
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
252
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,690
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
253
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,630
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
254
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,000
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
255
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
256
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,840
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
257
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
The wind is probably testing our hearts
258
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,050
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
259
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,220
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
260
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,060
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
261
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,670
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
262
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,840
Will always be smiling right near by
263
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,550
I heard you figured out the identities
of the Four Celestials?
264
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,550
Yes. They are the Ninja of
the Village of the Artisans
265
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,220
who've been harboring ill feeling
toward the Five Great Nations.
266
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,220
It seems they’ve completed
the forbidden project
267
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,920
passed down in the village and
268
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
intend to resurrect
their ultimate weapon.
269
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,000
I see. I take it the other villagers
got wind of it and evacuated.
270
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,000
Exactly. You head over to
where they are immediately.
271
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,600
Yes, ma’am.
272
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,770
Next time:
“The Ultimate Weapon Reborn”
//%
1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:13,960
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,640
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,650
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,660
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,330
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,900
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:17,660
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,000
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,230
Our two hearts
11
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,020
The Weight of the Prized Artifact!
More to the right!
12
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,750
Okay! Okay!
13
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,160
There it is! That’s it!
14
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,030
But…
15
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,400
A teacup like this a treasure, huh…?
16
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,670
A delivery mission?
17
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,570
No, it’s delivery protection
to be exact.
18
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,640
There’s a higher risk of danger
than a regular delivery.
19
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,910
The Beauty of Nature is a treasure
of national importance so to speak.
20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,150
In monetary value, you could buy
one or two mountains with its value.
21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
For real…?
22
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,950
I’d like you to deliver it safely
to Kale Avenue
23
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,650
where it will be put on exhibition.
24
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,390
At any rate, what’s with
that humongous safe…?
25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,660
You’re late.
26
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,970
Kiba…
27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,070
Lady Tsunade told me to come
as pursuit personnel
28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,070
just in case something happens
to the delivery item…
29
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,640
Have you heard anything else?
30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
Nothing special other than
it’s an incredible treasure…
31
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,680
No Trespassing
Hey, you with the stupid look.
32
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,490
Huh?
33
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,660
Can’t you see
the “no trespassing” sign, huh?!
34
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,570
No, we came here on a delivery mission
from Lady Tsunade for that thing.
35
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,840
That’s right!
Here’s the paperwork.
36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Huh…?
37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,240
Look out.
lt’s going to fall!
38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,580
Run, Naruto!
39
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,280
Hey, what’re you doing, bro?
40
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,150
Hm? What’re you doing?!
Stop it, quickly!
41
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,060
You came on a mission, didn’t you?!
Get to work, you idiots!
42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,530
H-Hey!
43
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Even if you die, don’t knock it over!
44
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,870
All right!
45
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,580
All right!
46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,310
That was close…
47
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,650
S-So what should we do with this, bro?
48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,220
Die.
49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
You jerk…
50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,500
As for you brother, what kind
of person are you?!
51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,630
We were just about to die!
52
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,740
Huh?
53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,670
Ninja are supposed to risk their lives
on a commissioned mission, right?
54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,880
Just a minute, buddy!
55
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,440
I’m not your buddy!
56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,850
I’m your client on this mission, Shinemon.
57
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,650
Come on…
Get a move on if you’re not dead.
58
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,620
Akamaru, Fang over Fang!
59
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,660
No, I’ll pound him
with my Rasengan!
60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,530
Don’t get so serious!
61
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,470
Hey! What’s the deal?!
Are you guys not fired up?!
62
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,540
Jeez. Getting all
uselessly carried away.
63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,670
You’ll get no sympathy
if you get all tired later on!
64
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,380
This here is not like you guys, this here!
65
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,650
So you got too carried away
and dropped it?
66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,660
I’m so sorry!
67
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,660
Jeez… Well, we’ve got the time,
68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,900
so I guess all we can do
is go down and get it.
69
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,340
No… It seems we don’t
have that much time.
70
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,670
Huh?
71
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,110
Wh-What do we do, Kiba?!
72
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,220
If we took the roundabout way,
we’d never make it in time!
73
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
All right!
74
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,650
All right?
What’re you going to do, buddy?!
75
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,660
Let’s bungee jump!
76
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,100
Why me…?!
77
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,600
Die like you just don’t care!
I’ll pick up your bones for you!
78
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,610
I did it!
79
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,140
No way?!
80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,650
That was a close one.
81
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,350
Idiot! Naruto, behind you, behind you!
82
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,920
Huh? What?
83
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,830
No way!
84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,120
That was a close one…
85
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,220
Y-You…
86
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,350
You got a problem? Huh?
87
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,920
A Ninja expects to lose his life
on a mission, right?!
88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Buddy, you want to try dying once…?
89
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,770
Don’t stop me, Kiba!
90
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,870
I’ll pound him no matter what
with my Rasengan!
91
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,640
S-Stop it! Calm down, Naruto!
92
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,640
I’m really sorry!
93
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,790
Hey, act more natural.
94
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,390
You idiot…
95
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,400
I am acting natural,
no matter how you look at it…!
96
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,270
No way… Totally unnatural…
97
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,270
Just a minute, you guys.
98
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Jeez…
99
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,640
It seems there’s something
very valuable in there…
100
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,950
If you like,
we could carry it for you instead.
101
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,520
Now… Hand it over here.
102
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,450
We’ll carry it for you with care.
103
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,650
N-No…
104
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,660
It’s not really anything valuable.
105
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,790
I mean, how should I put it…right?
106
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,700
That’s right. It’s not like that at all.
Right, buddy?
107
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,200
What’re you guys talking about?!
lt’s extremely valuable.
108
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,000
Have you forgotten that there’s
a national treasure-class relic inside?!
109
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,310
It’s the Beauty of Nature!
110
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,440
It’s the Beauty of Nature
more valuable than human life!
111
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,640
Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!
112
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,450
Wh-What’re you saying?!
113
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,650
Hey, buddy, do you understand
the situation?!
114
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,820
Shut up! Situation?
You gotta be kidding!
115
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,660
I absolutely won’t forgive anyone
who insults the Beauty of Nature!
116
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,130
So… A treasure more valuable
than life, huh…?
117
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,660
Then you won’t have a problem
with being killed, right?
118
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,500
Oh, sorry… I must be going
as I’ve got cram school today.
119
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,780
Run!
120
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,550
–Hey, hold it!
–Hey, hold it!
121
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,580
I’ll take care of things here.
You escape with Shinemon, Kiba!
122
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,950
Right! Come on!
123
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,730
Others have popped up!
124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,030
What’re you doing escaping with me?!
125
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,700
Do something quickly, you idiot!
126
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,000
Jeez, what a jerk…!
127
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
You go on ahead!
128
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Okay… Let’s go, Akamaru!
129
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,660
A battle has started again, huh?
130
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,660
Yes. A battle has started again.
131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,730
It’s a sad thing.
132
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,100
Yes. It’s a sad thing.
133
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,830
H-Hey!
134
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,280
You’re late, you idiots.
135
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,050
I’ll get you, no matter what!
136
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,210
Akamaru, Fang Over Fang!
Fang Over Fang!
137
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,520
I-It’s a joke, man! A joke!
138
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,570
At last we’ve nailed down the location
of the treasured Beauty of Nature…
139
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,490
Something coming!
140
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,000
Buddy, you stay right here!
141
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
R-Right…!
142
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,600
Stop hiding and come on out!
143
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
A smoke screen.
That’s a good idea…!
144
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,650
What’re you doing
getting impressed, you idiot?!
145
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,050
Do something, quickly!
146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,210
We know!
147
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,650
Let’s go, Kiba!
148
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,650
Yeah!
149
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,320
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
150
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Now, let’s tear it up, Akamaru!
151
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,660
Since our vision has been sealed,
we’ll just use scent!
152
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,200
Let’s show them, Akamaru!
153
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,870
Where are you hiding?!
154
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,240
The Beauty of Nature is mine.
155
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Oh no!
156
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,980
Let’s go, Akamaru!
157
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,910
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
158
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,120
Man Beast Clone!
159
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,650
Fang Over Fang!
160
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,560
Then…we’ll do this! Akamaru!
161
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,030
Dynamic Marking!
162
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,840
Whoa! What’s this?!
163
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,040
Buddy, what’s the matter?!
164
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,610
S-Something’s salty!
165
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,080
I’m coming!
166
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,040
Naruto, where are you?!
167
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,350
Get over here now, you idiot!
168
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,820
You’re late, Naruto!
169
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,670
You okay, buddy?
170
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Naruto…
171
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,710
Spraying piss?!
I’ll pound you guys for sure!
172
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,980
Taking back the treasure comes first!
173
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,750
That’s right!
174
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,320
Oh man! I knew I should’ve
taken charge of it!
175
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,660
If we trace the scent of
Akamaru’s Dynamic Marking,
176
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,690
it should work out, but…
177
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,700
I see, Akamaru…
They’re still not far?
178
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,540
All right, let’s go!
179
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,610
We did it… We finally did it!
180
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,650
What’re you doing?
181
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,650
Shut up!
182
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,850
They came to take this back!
Let’s get out of here!
183
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,660
You won’t get away!
184
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Hold it!
185
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
Impertinent! Go!
186
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,860
We’ll handle things here.
187
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,830
So you go after him!
188
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,700
–Right! 					–Let’s go, Kiba!
189
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Right!
190
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,640
Hold it!
191
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,480
You won’t get away, you jerk!
192
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,650
It ends here! See you later!
193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,070
Let’s hurry!
194
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,000
I won’t hand it over…!
195
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Let go!
196
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,450
Boy, I was going to let you
slide by with your life, but…
197
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,690
Give it back…
198
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,130
The Beauty of Nature…
Give it back…!
199
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,640
Haven’t you
misunderstood something?
200
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,940
You’ll let me off with my life?
201
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,640
That Beauty of Nature…
202
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,650
is a super first-rate treasure
more precious than human life…
203
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,950
The question of my life
was never of a concern!
204
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,320
Don’t make light of me! Got that?!
205
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,400
You okay, buddy?!
206
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,310
Jeez, you Genin are really useless.
207
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,210
You’re all beaten up yourself, buddy!
208
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,650
Y-You jerk!
209
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,150
Damn it! I’ll put an end
to things here at once!
210
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,660
Everything’s over!
211
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,530
We’ll be in a fix
if we don’t hurry, Naruto!
212
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,630
Let’s get a move on, brother!
213
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,240
Buddy!
214
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,540
Quick! Take the Beauty of Nature
to a safe location.
215
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,850
No way, what’re you saying?!
216
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,210
You’ll get crushed if you don’t hurry.
217
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
Wh-What’re you guys looking at?!
218
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,650
Take the Beauty of Nature while you can…
219
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,190
What’re you saying?!
220
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Hurry!
221
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,340
Buddy! You okay?!
222
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,780
Oh! The Beauty of Nature!
223
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:48,190
Don’t move, buddy!
Gently, hold out your hand!
224
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,930
Idiot, what’re you doing?!
225
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,660
Just hurry up and come this way!
226
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,030
You guys are the idiots!
Forget about me.
227
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,670
If you’re Ninja,
do something about
228
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,640
the Beauty of Nature
rather than my life!
229
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,640
Naruto, let’s just forget
about this guy!
230
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,410
He should just die like
a dog on his own!
231
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Let’s hurry and get out of here!
232
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,050
Yeah, do as you like!
233
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,870
The Beauty of Nature…
234
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,770
Brother!
235
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,580
Am I…going to die…?
236
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,260
We were just about to die!
237
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Huh?
238
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,990
Ninja are supposed to
risk their lives
239
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,590
on a commissioned mission, right?
240
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,330
Come on…
Get a move on if you’re not dead.
241
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,740
It’s the Beauty of Nature!
242
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,210
It’s the Beauty of Nature,
more valuable than human life!
243
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,650
Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!
244
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,850
I’m gonna…just like this…
245
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,320
Haven’t you misunderstood something?
246
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,830
You’ll let me off with my life?
247
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,660
That Beauty of Nature…
248
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,330
is a super first-rate treasure
more precious than human life…
249
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,740
The question of my life
was never a concern!
250
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Heck no…
251
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,780
I don’t want to die!
252
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,660
There’s nothing in this world
more valuable than life!
253
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,820
Nice…bungee jump…
254
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,400
Now then, what shall I do now?
255
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,370
Y-Yeah…
256
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,640
Sure enough…
without the treasure…
257
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,950
Don’t mope like that.
That’s why you guys are useless.
258
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,920
But there’s no point without
the treasure after all!
259
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,590
Huh? If there isn’t one,
then I just have to make one.
260
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,260
Make…? You say that
like it’s easy, but….
261
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,560
That’s a picture of you, buddy.
262
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,530
The creator of the dauntless artifact…
263
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,570
Beauty of Nature …
Shinemon, the living national treasure?
264
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
So basically…?
265
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,310
That means you made
the Beauty of Nature, buddy?!
266
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,220
But, you’re…the client…
267
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,020
You got a problem
268
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,650
with the client being the creator
and a living national treasure?
269
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,260
But no matter how you look at it…
270
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,530
This here’s not like you guys!
This here!
271
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,460
Well, you know…
272
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,500
It means my life rather than
the treasure was the correct answer.
273
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
You do pretty good work for Genin.
274
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,570
Thanks for the help.
275
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,980
Now then, I guess I’ll hurry
276
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,640
and make a masterpiece to
exceed the Beauty of Nature!
277
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,530
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
278
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,700
Will always be smiling right near by
279
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,640
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
280
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,210
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
281
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,120
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
282
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,960
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
283
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,900
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
284
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,270
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
285
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,640
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
286
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:15,110
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
287
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,980
The wind is probably testing our hearts
288
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,320
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
289
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,490
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
290
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,330
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
291
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,930
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
292
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,110
Will always be smiling right near by
293
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,750
Your mission is to take that Ninja Dropout
we caught all the way to the capital.
294
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,020
What’s a Ninja Dropout?
295
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,950
It’s a gang of thieves consisting
of Rogue Ninja,
296
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,290
who don’t consider themselves
Shinobi anymore.
297
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,430
I can’t forgive them for using
their Shinobi powers for evil.
298
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,060
So, well, you can figure out
the rest by now.
299
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,360
In other words,
there is a possibility that they will
300
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,670
come to save one of their own.
301
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,730
Exactly.
302
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,840
You are assigned to the mission
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
303
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,340
Roger!
304
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,940
Next time:
“The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts”
//%
1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,020
So this is the Shukaku?
2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,690
It’s the first time I’ve seen
the real thing…
3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,300
It’s dangerous here!
We have to get away!
4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,570
But! Gaara Sensei…
5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,800
Shut up.
6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,940
Gaara is trying…to protect you!
7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,210
So hurry!
8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,540
R-Right.
9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,610
Hey! Could that be…?!
10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,810
Yeah…
11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,650
The Shukaku transformation
is starting.
12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,550
Gaara…
13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,390
Naruto!
14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,420
Naruto!
15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,560
Hinata, Sakura.
16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Matsuri, you okay?
17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,360
Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei…
18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,330
I leave her to you…
19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,880
Hold it! You are badly hurt!
20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,850
But…
21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
You’ll just become unable
to move right away!
22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,090
I’ll give you some first-aid treatment!
23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:28,800
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
24
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,550
The distance created between us
became too big,
25
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:54,560
because we were always together
26
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,570
Your honest reply, “See you…”
27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,270
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,840
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,820
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:32,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,840
I can feel it so close,
32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,110
Our two hearts
33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Departure
34
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,560
This is bad… It’s a matter of time.
35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
I knew it.
36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,230
Sakura! Hurry!
lt looks like we don’t have much time!
37
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,340
Got it! First, put your hands out.
38
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,570
R-Right…
39
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,650
What’s the meaning of this?
40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,550
What is it, Neji?
41
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,320
That guy wearing the armor is
releasing Chakra stronger than Gaara…
42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
who’s half transformed into a beast.
43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,600
That person called himself Seimei,
the creator of the Village of Artisans.
44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,900
He said something about being reborn
as the ultimate Ninja tool.
45
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,900
That jerk!
He’s taken away Gaara’s Chakra!
46
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,180
Come to think of it, the enemy
we fought wore similar armor…
47
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,510
and took away a great deal
of my Chakra.
48
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,850
Armor that sucks up Chakra…
49
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,320
And that alarming form…
50
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,080
It doesn’t look like
we can just carelessly get close.
51
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,190
Now… What do we do?
52
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,060
I didn’t figure on fighting
against the Shukaku…
53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,130
However, this is fun, too.
54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,600
As great as the Shukaku may be,
this way, I can prove that
55
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,000
it’s no match for the ultimate Ninja tool
of the Village of Artisans.
56
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,180
Why is this guy so strong?
57
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,190
I won’t allow my important people…
58
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,190
to get hurt!
59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,960
If not, I will stop you,
60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,970
even if that means that
I have to kill you!
61
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,670
Why…?
62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,700
How is it that you can fight
so much for other people…?
63
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,580
They saved me from
the hell of being all alone.
64
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,610
They accepted me for
who I was…
65
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,480
that’s why…
they are important to me!
66
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,560
Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,
67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,260
and to love and watch over that person…
68
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,500
Love…
69
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,830
That is why he is so strong?
70
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,490
Gaara!
71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
What’s that?
Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?
72
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,570
What happened to him?!
73
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,470
Gaara might be suppressing
Shukaku of his own volition.
74
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,640
Why? Wouldn’t he end up weakening
his own battle strength?
75
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,210
Even so, he chose to fight
with his own strength and will,
76
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,050
not Shukaku's power,
which he can’t control.
77
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,980
So you couldn’t maintain
the Shukaku body with that Chakra?
78
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,180
I’ll…help the friends important
to me with my own power…
79
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,020
How absurd.
80
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,550
A Shinobi doesn’t need emotion.
81
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,360
It is those who suppress their emotions
who can obtain great power.
82
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,260
Great power.
That power is the only justice.
83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
You’re finished now.
84
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,840
Eat this!
85
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,550
That’s as far as you go,
monster of the Sand Village.
86
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Acting tough, huh…?
87
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,400
You shouldn’t have
any Chakra left to fight with.
88
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,430
Indeed,  I only have a little bit
of Chakra left…
89
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,340
But do you think I just sat around
in the cage doing nothing at all?
90
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,510
What?!
91
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,940
Sand Tsunami!
92
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,550
You shouldn’t have
any sand you can control!
93
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,560
I’m Gaara of the desert!
94
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,560
It’s simple for me to crush rocks
and turn them into sand.
95
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,180
Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!
96
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,550
So you still had
that much power left, huh?
97
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,550
Then I’ll just suck up all of that power!
98
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,200
Gaara’s Chakra is being sucked out!
99
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,300
– Wha--?! 					– Gaara Sensei!
100
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,130
– Damn it! 					– Wait! Naruto!
101
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
What, Shikamaru? Don’t stop me!
102
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,570
You’ll just get in the way if you go!
103
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,110
Besides, our Gaara is strong!
104
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,010
Gaara…
105
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,890
Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:
106
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
Shukaku's Pike!
107
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,180
Wh-Why…? Why could you…?
108
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,480
Someone who gave up on being human
and was reborn as a Ninja tool
109
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,550
could never understand anyway.
110
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,550
I don’t understand. Why?
111
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,590
Why?!
112
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,460
Giant Sand Burial!
113
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,940
He did it!
114
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,810
Gaara Sensei won!
115
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,510
Yeah! Gaara!
116
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,920
– Gaara! 					– Gaara!
117
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,930
He’s okay…
118
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,000
He’s just extremely fatigued
119
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,600
on account of using
his Chakra all at once.
120
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,140
Gaara completely suppressed
the Shukaku on his own volition.
121
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Yeah…
122
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,180
I want to work hard
123
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,550
and become an existence acknowledged
by other people…
124
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,550
I thought that looking
at Naruto Uzumaki.
125
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,890
Ties with other people…
126
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,590
For me, until now, that was just hate
and murderous intent.
127
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,560
However, there’s something
I’ve understood just a little…
128
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,800
about the ties he goes so far for
and talks about.
129
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,580
Suffering, sorrow and happiness
can be shared with someone.
130
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,550
You’ve also made someone
you can share with at last…
131
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,920
Did you say something?
132
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,350
No, nothing…
133
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,730
We came to the trouble
of rushing here.
134
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,260
To think it’d be over…
135
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,630
It seems
the inexperienced knuckleheads
136
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,170
have grown a teeny weeny bit…
137
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,470
You are very strict.
138
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,140
Pervy Sage!
139
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,270
Oh, long time no see, Naruto.
140
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,280
Don’t give me that “long time no see”
garbage, you jerk Sage!
141
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,440
You were talking all big about
watching my training,
142
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,680
making me into your protégé
and stuff!
143
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,250
Where were you traipsing
around until now?!
144
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,820
Well, how can I put this?
I was gathering information.
145
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,520
It was probably just information
on naked ladies anyway, right?
146
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,860
You idiot!
147
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,700
Even I come through when it counts…
148
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,570
I was mainly after information
on the Akatsuki.
149
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,130
Akatsuki!
150
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,140
With this I’ve been able
to verify their actions.
151
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,840
And now as promised,
152
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,540
two years later when
they’ll move into high gear,
153
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,210
I will thoroughly train you.
154
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,560
I wonder if you’re prepared?
155
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
I’ve been tired of waiting!
156
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,670
I owe you one.
157
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,810
No. I just repaid the debt
from last time.
158
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,850
Next time, I’ll settle things
more properly.
159
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,680
Well, this time I’ll acknowledge
that you didn’t cry.
160
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,420
Not again.
161
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,520
Just like a woman…
162
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
What about him?
163
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,090
Huh?
164
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,720
Naruto?
165
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,460
I hear he’s leaving today on
a training journey with Jiraiya.
166
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,060
Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?
167
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,730
Yeah. 					lt’s such a pain.
168
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,400
He’s going to come back
having gotten stronger again.
169
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,770
See you around.
170
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,770
– Farewell… 					– See ya.
171
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,320
Please tell Naruto…
172
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,050
Thanks to him,
173
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,820
I figured out what the words
Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.
174
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,760
I’ll dedicate myself under
Gaara Sensei from now on…
175
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,600
What did he do?
176
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,250
Well, I guess that’s about it.
177
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,480
I read the Village of Artisans report
from the other day.
178
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,610
Although it didn’t go as far as
a perfect 100,
179
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,650
I’ll give you a passing grade.
180
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,850
No! I’m still very much lacking
in experience.
181
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,890
Of course!
182
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,190
I’ll have you carry out
several missions
183
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,460
and get you to build up
lots of experience,
184
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,530
so make sure to dedicate yourself!
185
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
What?! Does that mean
I’m totally going to get overworked?
186
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,100
Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?
187
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,170
Ino?
188
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,640
Sure. What’s up?
189
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,540
As, as it happens,
I was thinking about it the while…
190
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,140
But it became totally clear to me
on this mission!
191
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,310
Clear that I’d be no good at all
at this rate!
192
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,850
Ino.
193
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,150
It’s frustrating,
but I was envious of you.
194
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,560
You, who everyone depended on.
195
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,560
So, please.
I also want to become a Medical Ninja.
196
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,230
I know it’ll be hard.
197
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,570
But I’ve got guts and I’ll manage
the studying, no matter what.
198
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,540
So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?
199
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
– Sure. 					– Really?!
200
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,270
But prepare yourself.
201
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,850
Once that happens,
you’ll be my little sister protégé.
202
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,680
What’s that…?
203
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,180
Naturally!
204
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,220
After all, I’ll be your
Medical Ninja superior, you know.
205
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,920
Man, I can’t wait.
206
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,830
You’ll be my lovable little sister protégé.
207
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,860
I’ll train you nice and hard.
208
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,570
Just you watch!
I’ll pass you up right away!
209
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,670
Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!
210
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,940
I’ll do it! Billboard Brow!
211
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,640
Why?! Why is it?!
212
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,010
What are you talking about?!
213
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,220
Why was I the only one left out
of the mission the other day?!
214
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,320
But you were with
a different team then, right?
215
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,720
But everyone had taken part!
216
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,930
She’s kind of in a rage.
217
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,560
It’s hard being the only one left out
of a mission.
218
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,800
Come to think of it,
219
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,800
it seems Naruto finally leaves
for training.
220
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,540
I heard. It seems that Jiraiya
is going to be his mentor.
221
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,010
Damn it! That guy’s going
to get strong again.
222
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,950
It looks like the village will
get quiet for a while.
223
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,980
Viewed in that light,
it’s a little bit sad, isn’t it?
224
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,350
No! This isn’t the time
to be getting sad!
225
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,560
I must work hard!
226
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,560
Several times more,
several times more.
227
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,960
If I don’t work hard hundreds
of times more than Naruto,
228
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,060
I won’t be able to face him
the next time we meet.
229
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,900
Your guard is off!
230
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,340
We also must grow by that time.
231
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,450
It’s because trying to improve
by learning from others,
232
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,680
that is what’s called friendship.
233
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,520
Good grief,
we’d better not lose, Akamaru.
234
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,590
Same here!
235
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,920
Hey, you okay, Lee?!
236
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,190
I’m fine, I’m fine.
237
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,640
Lady Hinata, let’s call it a day.
238
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,140
What? I’m still…
239
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,010
It’s about time for his departure.
240
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,520
Oh!
241
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,250
You won’t be able to
see him for a while.
242
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,890
I see… It looks like you’ll be
on a long journey…
243
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Yeah!
244
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,170
Listen up.
Be sure to train and don’t goof off.
245
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,570
Right! You can count on me!
246
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,970
It’s about time to go, Naruto.
247
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,480
Right!
248
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,350
Okay! I’m off, Iruka Sensei!
249
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,690
I’ll pay you back for the ramen
once I’ve become a success.
250
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,820
Jeez…
251
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,570
Good luck, Naruto.
252
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,450
Keep your eyes on me.
253
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,190
What’re you doing?!
I’ll leave you behind, Naruto.
254
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,630
Hey. H-Hey, wait up!
255
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,970
I also have to work hard in order
to catch up with Naruto.
256
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,360
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
257
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:29,570
Will always be smiling right near by
258
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,510
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
259
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,010
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
260
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,920
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
261
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,760
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
262
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,730
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
263
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,100
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
264
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
265
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,940
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
266
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,820
The wind is probably testing our hearts
267
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,150
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
268
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,330
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
269
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,130
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
270
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,770
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
271
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,940
Will always be smiling right near by
272
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,180
It’s been two years since his departure.
273
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,550
Now the count down to
the battle begins.
274
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,520
Those who pursue and those
who are pursued.
275
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,820
Time will not wait for the boy.
276
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,190
As Akatsuki Organization begins
to take action,
277
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,530
the day of Orochimaru’s reincarnation
draws near.
278
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,430
In order to take back what he lost,
279
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,540
the boy once again throws himself
into the maelstrom of cruel fate…
280
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,270
Next time: “Homecoming”
//%
1
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,880
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:29,790
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,090
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,250
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,420
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,960
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,840
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,130
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:18,800
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:28,790
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,340
Heh! It’s over…
13
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,090
Losing is not an Option
14
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,340
What?!
15
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,670
Just barely…
16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,460
That was a close one.
17
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,790
But…I was able to throw it off
just a little.
18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,170
There’s no mistake.
19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,250
He’s now realized the secret
of the Byakugan.
20
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,420
What’s the meaning of this?
How?!
21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,050
How was he able to throw it
22
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,130
a whole six inches
from his vital point?!
23
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,300
I see… That Chakra!
24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,790
He was emitting Chakra
the whole time
25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,000
and covered the area surrounding him!
26
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,790
And in a wide range to that extent.
27
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,630
No wonder he was able
to detect the arrow and
28
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,790
throw off the trajectory of it.
29
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,960
But constantly emitting that
much Chakra is a death throe…
30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,790
If he doesn’t go that far,
he can’t dodge.
31
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,090
In other words, there’s no mistake.
32
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,920
It’s as I hypothesized…
33
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,670
The arrow earlier was
totally invisible to him!
34
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,800
He doesn’t carry out useless attacks…
35
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,550
And from the results,
he accurately examines the information.
36
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,550
And…he’s also discovered
the weakness of my eyes…
37
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,710
Impressive.
38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,210
Of all the enemies
I’ve fought until now,
39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,050
this guy’s the strongest!
40
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,090
He has 360-degree sight.
41
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,800
And he unfailingly detects attacks
42
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,670
that penetrate the roughly
150-feeot circumference around him.
43
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,130
But for some reason,
44
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,000
there were Kunai Knives
he couldn’t evade completely.
45
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,210
Why couldn’t he evade them?
46
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,000
Because he couldn’t see them!
47
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,590
In other words, even his Visual Jutsu
has a slight blind spot!
48
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,800
Being unable to see Kunai Knives
entering that blind spot,
49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,210
he’s unable to react.
50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,630
So he was dealing with attacks
from the blind spot
51
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,790
with that defense technique.
52
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,630
And I analyzed all the attacks
I carried out
53
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,550
and grasped them perfectly.
54
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,920
Right behind his first thoracic vertebra…
55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,550
there exists a blind spot expanding
from a very small point.
56
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,590
Indeed, if he moves and
doesn’t stabilize the blind spot,
57
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,340
it becomes difficult to aim there
with an arrow.
58
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,840
But such a trick…doesn’t fool me!
59
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,750
Gentle Fist is pointless if
you don’t come close to your enemy.
60
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,790
And you can’t afford to think about
approaching me at this point.
61
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,000
It’s about how to escape now…
62
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,250
Though whether you struggle or not,
you’re going to die anyway.
63
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,130
Heh… It seems you only
have a little Chakra left.
64
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,550
The fate of the small fry character
in an easy game
65
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,500
is to be destroyed right away!
66
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,550
It’s useless!
67
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,590
A thread?!
68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
I see, with this thread…
69
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,840
This time, the trajectory was thrown off
slightly by the trees, huh?
70
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,880
If that’s the case…
71
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,210
I’ll add some rotation this time.
72
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,500
So even if it hits a tree,
73
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,170
it’ll just cut through and the trajectory
won’t be thrown off.
74
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,630
And as before…
75
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,840
I’ll control the arrow up until
150 feet away from him
76
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,790
using a thread with Chakra
flowing through.
77
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,380
I’ll take aim at the moving target…
78
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,590
and plunge the arrow into
the blind spot with a pinpoint attack!
79
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,460
He’s still standing up?
80
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,960
He’s strong…
He’s much stronger than me.
81
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,790
I hardly have any Chakra left now.
82
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,550
I probably won’t be able to evade
his next attack completely.
83
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,790
Is this it?
84
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,800
I’ll win no matter what!
85
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,790
Naruto… I wonder what you’d do.
86
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,710
I’ve had enough.
87
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,790
I can’t dodge it anyway.
88
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,170
He’s stopped moving…
Has he given up?
89
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,630
But just to make doubly sure…
90
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,460
Maximum destructive power
with 120% accuracy.
91
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,170
I’ve got him!
92
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,960
This is it.
93
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,340
Gentle Fist!
94
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,790
Wh-What? He still…?!
95
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,000
No! My attack just now
should’ve made the kill.
96
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,050
Substance with Chakra base…
97
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,300
It’s meaningless against Gentle Fist.
98
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,790
Gentle Fist…
99
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I see, in his final moments,
100
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,420
he funneled the last Chakra
through the thread!
101
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,630
Eight crows…
102
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,170
Again I couldn’t see one of them.
103
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,790
What happened to him?
104
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,670
He damaged several of
my internal organs.
105
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,380
But…I can still move.
106
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,790
You failure…
107
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,790
I told you… I don’t know when to quit!
108
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,790
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?
109
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,790
Because I was called…a failure!
110
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,790
But if you’re going to say it’s futile,
you don’t have to do anything!
111
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,790
After I become the Hokage,
I’ll change Hyuga!
112
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,630
The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?
113
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,790
I was careless…
114
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,670
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu
I stunk at.
115
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,300
Don’t be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,
116
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,170
and how it can’t be changed!
117
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,340
Unlike me,
118
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,340
you're not a failure.
119
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,920
Naruto…
120
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,170
Now it’s become the three of us…
121
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,800
Don’t worry about such things.
122
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,590
Both Choji and Neji will
catch up right away.
123
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,790
Choji had the trump card.
124
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,790
And I’ve fought Neji
in the Chunin exam, so I know…
125
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,460
Know what?
126
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,790
That he’s…a true genius. Believe it!
127
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,250
I cannot lose…
128
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,380
Whether he’s an enemy
much stronger than me…
129
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,130
or even if this body should fail me…
130
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,500
I cannot lose!
131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,630
I have a reason why I cannot lose!
132
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,790
I’ve had a hard time of it this time.
133
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,300
I played too long…
134
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,880
Huh?
135
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,420
I can’t build up Chakra…
136
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,960
How? You should’ve
been instantly killed!
137
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,960
How come you’re alive?!
138
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,790
I couldn’t completely
evade it anyway.
139
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
So I was prepared to deliberately
take the hit.
140
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,210
And I knew of my own weakness
much more than you do…
141
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,170
There were eight crows, huh?
142
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,710
This Byakugan has a blind spot.
143
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,790
However, if I knew that your attack
would only come from there…
144
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,790
I could release my Chakra just
to that blind spot and detect the attack.
145
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,880
It’s not so difficult to make
146
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,550
a move of just a few inches
to throw off the aim.
147
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,790
I’d suffer a serious injury,
but instant death can be avoided.
148
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,250
So you took the hit deliberately…?
149
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,710
It doesn’t change the fact
that you’re going to die here.
150
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,670
How can you go that far?!
151
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,170
“Of all the enemies,”
you’re the strongest I’ve ever fought…
152
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,790
But, there’s a reason why I cannot lose.
153
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:21,130
Of all those I’ve ever fought,
the strongest one said this to me…
154
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,550
– Unlike me…you are not a failure!
– Unlike me…you are not a failure!
155
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,920
He said that.
156
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,380
I’ve been called a genius all along.
157
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,710
So I cannot lose.
158
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,790
And for the sake of those guys
who believe
159
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,790
that this humdrum and small me
is a genius!
160
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,790
“The fate of the small fry character
in a game is to be destroyed right away.”
161
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,710
You said that, didn’t you?
162
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,210
Look at this situation!
163
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,670
Things like fate,
isn’t determined by someone!
164
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,500
I wonder…
165
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,790
You also look like
you’re going to die!
166
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,790
Neji, live.
167
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,460
More than anyone in the clan,
168
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,000
you’re the man loved most
by the Hyuga ability…
169
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,800
I cannot die so easily.
170
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,500
Even if you act tough,
you can’t stem the current now…
171
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,590
Master Sasuke ran to
the Sound Village by his own wish.
172
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,170
Sasuke is now in the darkness…
173
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,790
No…
174
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,210
Naruto… You’ve got better eyes than me.
175
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,670
There’s a person who can find him
in the darkness and save him.
176
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,090
Master Sasuke belongs
to Lord Orochimaru.
177
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,420
No matter who it may be,
they can’t save…
178
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,500
He can save him!
179
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,630
Because…Naruto…you…
180
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,050
You saved me from the darkness!
181
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,050
Talking rubbish until the end…
182
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,460
But…
183
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,630
I haven’t been pushed this far
since Kimimaro.
184
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,170
Damn it…
185
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,790
Everyone…
186
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,710
I'll leave the rest…
187
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,210
to you.
188
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,790
For the first time, I spoke to you
189
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,790
And you smiled
190
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,420
For the first time, I was able to speak
191
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,170
In my own words
192
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,790
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
193
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,380
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
194
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,960
My clumsy attempts with words
195
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:58,790
You listened without turning away
196
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,920
No wonder I get carried away by you
197
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:12,000
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
198
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,250
I feel so sad
199
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,210
But…
200
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,790
For the first time, I spoke to you
201
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,790
And you smiled
202
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,500
For the first time, I was able to speak
203
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,590
In my own words
204
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,960
For the first time, I spoke to you
205
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,210
And you smiled
206
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,790
For the first time, I was able to speak
207
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,790
In my own words
208
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,380
For the first time, I spoke to you
209
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,000
Yahoo! The enemies are quite close!
210
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,420
All right! We’ll catch up in a burst!
211
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,000
Speaking in terms of number,
we’ve got more!
212
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,790
If things go well,
we can get him back next!
213
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,710
Yeah! I don’t feel like losing
with four against two!
214
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,710
Four against two?
215
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,790
That’s twice the opponents’ number!
216
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,210
Say-say. Were there four of us?
217
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,000
Are you an idiot?!
Me, Akamaru, Shikamaru, and you!
218
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,920
No matter how you count,
there are four!
219
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,250
Next episode:
“The Vessel Arrives Too Late”
//%
1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,500
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,250
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,990
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,540
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,040
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:45,990
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,370
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:06,160
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:15,750
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,910
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,990
I guess the storm is
going to come soon…
12
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,000
Let’s hurry and head back
to the curry shop.
13
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,580
Oh my.
14
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,580
That thunder right now…
15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,250
came from the direction
of the Katabami Gold Mine…
16
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,290
Raiga's Counterattack
17
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,990
B-Boss.
18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,750
R-Ranmaru!
19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,950
Hey, wake up, Ranmaru!
20
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,990
Quit joking around.
I’m not laughing…
21
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,700
Hey…Ranmaru…!
22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,040
You… What did you do
to Ranmaru?
23
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,000
N-No! He…
24
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,200
When Ranmaru held your hand…
25
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,290
you revived and…
26
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,200
And then…Ranmaru…
27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,990
Ranmaru…
28
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,620
Why is Raiga up?!
29
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,410
I must stop him.
30
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,660
Thunder?
31
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,910
Could it be?!
32
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,200
You’re slow!
33
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,660
Are you…that brat’s comrade…?
34
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,080
If it’s a wooden weapon, then…
35
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,200
But I can’t hold it over my head…
36
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,660
You’re annoying!
37
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,410
You little fly…!
38
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,250
Quit buzzing!
39
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
I’m…not smart, you know…
40
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,250
Huh…?
41
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,040
I don’t know why this happened…
42
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,120
Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?!
43
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,790
N-No! That’s not true!
44
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,500
Perhaps…the guys from the Leaf…
45
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,990
Oh yeah…
lf they didn’t come,
46
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,200
then Ranmaru and I would
have been together forever…
47
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,660
Where are they?!
48
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,990
You know, don’t you?!
lf you don’t know, I’ll kill you!
49
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,250
I know…
50
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,990
Maybe…!
51
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,250
Take me…where they are…
52
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,620
Go!
53
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,830
Yes!
54
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,660
Hold on, Ranmaru.
For your funeral…
55
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,700
I’ll offer up their corpses for you.
56
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,750
Ranmaru…
57
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,200
This child… Did he give up his life
in order to revive Raiga?
58
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,410
Rai…ga… Rai…
59
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,500
Ranmaru! You're alive!
60
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,910
Hang in there! Ranmaru!
61
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,990
Ranmaru!
62
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,160
It started raining.
63
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,080
But we’re almost done.
64
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,410
Oh my, I’m happy that
you all did this much for me.
65
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Oh no!
66
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,080
Mom! Something horrible happened!
67
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,160
Oh my… What happened, Karashi?
68
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,700
Tenten is…!
69
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,250
What happened to Tenten?
70
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,750
She…fell from a cliff and..
71
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,700
What?!
72
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,990
What do you mean?!
73
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,790
I was running with her and
74
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,290
Tenten said that she would train me
in place of Lee…
75
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,580
But there…when we were
approaching the Lightning Pass,
76
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,500
the lightning struck and
a tree came falling and
77
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,910
Tenten fell from the Pass
to the bottom of the cliff!
78
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,200
Oh my! Then you must go
help her out immediately!
79
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,790
Let’s go to help, Tenten!
80
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,540
Yeah!
81
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,250
Umm… No, I will…
82
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,500
I will come after you guys
with the first-aid kit.
83
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Okay.
84
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,990
Let’s go, Naruto, Lee.
85
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,700
– Yes! 					– Right!
86
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,370
Oh my, Karashi?
87
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,540
Mom, we’re running away
from here.
88
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,990
What are you saying, child?!
89
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,040
Never mind that!
90
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,330
I’ll explain it later,
so hurry up and get ready.
91
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,990
I will wait at the Lightning Pass.
92
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,330
Bring them for sure. If not…
93
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:44,410
I’ll offer up you and your mom’s corpses
to Ranmaru…
94
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,330
Mom, please!
95
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,660
I don’t want to!
96
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm going to wait
until everybody comes back!
97
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,620
Mom! You are so stubborn!
98
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,990
Just come with me!
99
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you think that Tenten would
fall off a cliff
100
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,950
merely because of the thunder?
101
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,830
Huh? What do you mean?
102
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,990
That Karashi…
lt seems like he wasn’t trained enough.
103
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,500
I’m sorry…
104
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,160
Then…
105
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,870
Perhaps…it’s some kind
of trap again.
106
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,990
Or he’s been threatened
by someone…
107
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,040
But the Kurosuki Family is…!
108
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,910
Maybe my eyes were cloudy…
109
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,620
No way!
110
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,750
It’s him…
111
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,910
He’s burning up with fever…
112
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,910
Raiga…?
113
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,990
He revived, so you should too…
114
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,750
It’s all right. I’m going to die
soon anyway.
115
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,990
No way! I’m not going to let you say
that you're going to die so easily!
116
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,500
The people who were killed by you
and Raiga died against their will!
117
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,200
I’m not going to let it go your way!
118
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,750
For the sake of those
whose freedoms you took away.
119
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,830
I’m going to have you
take responsibility!
120
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,620
Are you okay?
121
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,910
The storm… It’ll be dangerous
to stay here…
122
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,200
To Grandma’s place.
123
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,700
You’ve come!
124
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,190
Raiga!
125
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,990
So he is alive.
126
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,400
This time I’ll take you down for sure!
127
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,240
Let’s go!
128
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,860
That’s not good! Lee!
129
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,360
What are you…?
130
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,150
What is this?
131
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,190
It’s in a whole different level
from before…!
132
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,570
Probably that attack was
lightning made of Chakra.
133
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,150
But this one…
134
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,820
Real lightning is used as the source…
135
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,240
If he can utilize the power of nature,
unlike Chakra, he’ll have no limits!
136
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,190
Get down!
137
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,950
Byakugan!
138
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,780
If we dodge through
the electric shock and
139
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,070
take this to a close-range battle…
140
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,190
Naruto!
141
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,190
I know it!
142
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,950
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
143
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,280
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
144
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,030
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
145
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,570
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
146
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,360
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
147
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,400
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
148
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,030
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
149
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,190
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
150
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,530
Good job, Naruto!
151
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,240
Gentle Fist!
152
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,280
Neji!
153
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,820
You brats! Is that all you know?
154
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,110
Unlike the natural thunder power
I’m using,
155
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,280
Chakra has its limits!
156
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,150
Huh…?
157
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,450
You’re an idiot!
There’s an idiot here!
158
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,610
Is that what you say to an opponent
who fought with all his power?!
159
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,900
Huh?
160
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,360
You again…
161
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,280
This time I’m not going to
have a funeral for you!
162
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,950
I am angry.
163
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,400
Oh my, what are you doing?!
164
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,360
Please Mom, come with me!
165
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,860
There’s no time.
166
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,190
No, I’m going to stay here!
167
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,030
Oh Tenten!
168
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,700
Oh my! This stupid son of mine!
169
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,820
I couldn’t help it,
because the boss came back to life…
170
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,740
If we stay here,
we’re going to get killed.
171
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,610
The only choice we have
is to run away!
172
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,400
If you want to run away,
then go.
173
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,610
I’m not running away.
174
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,400
I’m not going to give up,
I will save this child.
175
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,320
I will feed this boy
the curry of life!
176
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,820
Grandma…
177
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,030
It’s the curry that revived Lee.
178
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,490
Yes.
179
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,700
If anything happens,
it’s not my fault!
180
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,240
You!
181
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
One, two…
182
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,320
One, two…
183
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,030
One, two… One, two…
184
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,610
One, two… One, two…
185
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,490
This is bad…
186
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,190
This is really bad!
187
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,190
Eat this…you’ll feel better.
188
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,900
Please.
189
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,990
You messed up on
mixing the spices.
190
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh my?!
191
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,240
Karashi, could you have memorized
my recipe of the curry of life?
192
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,240
Karashi…
193
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,740
This is the true curry of life.
194
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,240
Here, please eat this.
195
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,190
You can’t even eat
if you’re not with Raiga?
196
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,190
Why…?
197
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,650
Why…for a person like me?
198
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,610
Does one need a reason
to save someone?
199
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,200
To save you,
200
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,280
Grandma Sansho and Karashi
did their best to make the curry.
201
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,780
Don’t you feel anything seeing
those two trying their best?
202
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,820
If you don’t feel anything,
you’re a horrible human being!
203
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,450
Human beings support each other
in order to live…
204
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,990
If there are people who need help,
don’t others naturally lend them a hand?
205
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,190
Isn’t that being human?
206
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,190
Anyway, one bite is fine.
Why don’t you try it?
207
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,990
Was it good?
208
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,780
That is what it feels like to live.
209
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,150
Raiga …
210
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,990
I want him to eat this curry too.
211
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,450
Let’s go.
212
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,110
I’m far from finished…!
213
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,820
This guy…
What is up with him?
214
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:41,820
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
215
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:53,280
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
216
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:04,740
What dreams did you chase to get here?
217
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:16,950
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
218
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:28,240
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
219
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:39,900
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
220
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,610
I’ll be close to you
221
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,490
Damn it! What in the world
happened to my body?!
222
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,740
It is pitch black in front of me,
my entire body is numb,
223
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,240
and my body doesn’t do
what I want it to do.
224
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,990
What is this feeling…?
225
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,950
It’s warm, my entire body
is burning,
226
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,190
and what is this taste that brings energy
up from the bottom of my stomach…?
227

Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,300
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,890
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,600
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,010
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,390
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,430
What should we do, Aoi?
21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,930
I’ll go with Fukusuke.
22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,800
You go after Idate.
23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
– Right! 					– Right!
24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,390
Hey, Idate!
The ocean is that way!
25
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,300
Where are you going!
Come back!
26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Hah! There’s no way
I’m going back!
27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,350
Let’s go!
28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,550
Right!
29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,890
What does that kid think
he’s doing?
30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,470
Looks like he’s run away.
31
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,800
Idate’s been like that
from long ago.
32
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,970
You know him?
33
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,840
Yes, kind of…
34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,840
The Race is On!
Trouble on the High Seas!
35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,470
I knew he’d run away,
that bastard Idate.
36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,640
Knowing him this long,
you must’ve figured this would happen.
37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,390
It was a mistake to let him run!
38
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,050
You idiots!
ldate isn’t that kind of kid!
39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,300
– Boss! 					– Boss…
40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
I believe in Idate.
41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,930
He must have a plan.
42
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,390
Jirocho!
43
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,220
Chief Retainer!
44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,800
How do you think
you’re going to settle this?
45
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,840
You've turned this grand traditional
festival into a mere farce…
46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,600
And worse,
in the presence of the lord!
47
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,510
Sir, the race has just begun.
Please watch it until the end.
48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Since you insist that much,
you had better win.
49
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,050
If you lose…
50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,180
I’ll ask for the dissolution
of your family!
51
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,600
Agreed! I’m a man of my word.
52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,350
If Idate loses,
you may do anything you wish.
53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,760
How like Wasabi’s Jirocho.
Such confidence.
54
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,350
Don't let us down.
55
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,050
I’m counting on you, Idate.
56
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Boss…
57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,680
Give me your money!
58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,890
Just be still!
59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,550
A starving thief, huh…
60
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,470
Sh-Shut up!
61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,430
A kid trying to act tough!
62
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,600
With that little thing,
63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,930
you can’t even peel an apple,
can you?!
64
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,930
Here!
65
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,220
Take this.
66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,260
Edged tools aren’t
for hurting people.
67
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
You don’t have anywhere to go,
do you?
68
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,390
I’m Jirocho of Wasabi
of Degarashi Port.
69
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,390
Wasabi…Jirocho?
70
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,050
How about it?
Why don’t you come to my place?
71
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,350
I-I just tried to…
72
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,390
Anyone on the verge of starvation
will make such mistakes…
73
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,390
I don’t hold it against you.
74
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,550
Ah…this…
75
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,050
I gave it to you. 					Keep it.
76
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,800
Don’t ever do stupid things
like stealing…
77
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,840
M-Mister!
78
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,430
Listen!
Make me your henchman!
79
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,100
No, I mean…
could you please, Boss!
80
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,140
What’s your name?
81
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,800
Idate…
My name is Idate Morino.
82
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,390
Shall we go then, Idate?
83
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,840
Boss, just trust in me!
I will win, no matter what!
84
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,180
We can catch up
to him in a bit!
85
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,840
But it’s too late now!
86
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,510
He can’t win if
he’s this far from the port!
87
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,840
No, he may've planned to come
this way from the very beginning.
88
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,600
What?
89
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,050
Huh?
90
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,840
How lucky!
91
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,350
Now, we can stop them here.
92
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,800
At any rate…
93
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,350
who would’ve thought
they’d be escorting him.
94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Double Lucky!
Now I can pay them back.
95
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,840
For what they did to us
during the Chunin Exams.
96
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,840
You two go ahead.
I’ll keep them here.
97
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,840
All right!
98
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Finally, we’ve caught up to you!
99
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,300
Hey, wait!
100
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,220
Geez! Why on earth
did you come this way?!
101
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,840
Shut up!
lt’s none of your business!
102
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,970
What kinda attitude is that?!
103
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,350
I said to shut up!
104
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,510
Watch out!
105
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,850
They aren’t aware of it, are they?
106
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,140
Of Genjutsu?
107
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,220
Hey, I said wait up!
108
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
I’ve already been here?
109
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,300
Darn! Looks like
I’ve been tricked by Genjutsu.
110
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,760
Wha-?!
111
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
If that’s the case…
112
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,720
Release!
113
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
There!
114
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,140
H-Hey!
115
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,800
No! Don’t go that way!
116
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,300
Huh? What’s going on?
117
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,600
I’m out of it!
118
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,220
Just be still!
119
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,840
We’ll get pulled up now!
120
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,890
That was close…
121
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,840
A double Genjutsu.
122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,510
Pretty elaborate trick.
123
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,470
You idiot! It’s your fault that
we’re going through all this!
124
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,890
What did you say?!
125
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,050
Hey, stop! Stop, I said!
126
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,840
My Ninja tools!
127
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,850
That was an unnecessary help!
128
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,800
Did you say unnecessary?!
129
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,510
Hey bastard, can’t you even
thank us for saving you?!
130
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,930
You saved me
because it’s your duty!
131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,300
No need to thank you!
132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
What did you say?!
133
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,840
Stop, Naruto. He’s right.
134
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,260
But if you don’t want to die,
you should stay close to us.
135
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,140
Hey, where are you going?!
136
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,470
Aren’t you going back
to Port Degarashi?
137
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,930
Stupid, I’m heading north from here!
138
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,430
North? Is it faster that way?
139
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,180
Yeah…
140
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,260
Who knows…
I really don’t trust this guy!
141
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,840
This is why Ninja are no good.
142
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,800
What?!
143
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,680
At this time of year,
144
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,840
a strong seasonal wind blows
across this ocean…
145
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
At the starting point, I watched the clouds
and realized it…
146
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,890
That the wind was coming.
147
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,760
On top of that,
at the port to the north,
148
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,930
there’s an ocean current
that flows straight to Nagi Island.
149
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,720
This part is different from you guys.
Right here!
150
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,840
Looks like it’s getting a bit rough.
151
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,930
Hey, don’t push it!
152
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,850
Head more towards the south!
153
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
But that’ll take up quite some time.
154
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,600
Once we get on the land,
no one can run faster than I can.
155
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,800
My victory is already set!
156
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,840
All right…
157
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,970
I taste salt in the air.
158
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,260
It’s the ocean!
159
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,930
What is it that far out on the ocean?
160
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,800
It’s the halfway point --
Nagi Island where Modoroki shrine is.
161
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,430
I can get there within an hour.
Wait for a sec.
162
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,470
Hey, old man, I’m here!
lt's Idate from the Wasabi Family!
163
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,840
Ah, I’ve been waiting for you.
164
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,350
Looks like I was right.
165
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,850
I’ll need you to lend me a boat.
166
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,510
I see. I have it ready.
167
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,350
Use that boat.
168
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,840
It’s the fastest boat around here.
169
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,180
I'm grateful to you!
170
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,390
No problem. Boss Jirocho has done
so much for me.
171
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,680
So, don’t lose to Wagarashi!
172
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,430
I’m fed up with how
they handle things.
173
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,180
Leave it to me!
174
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,840
I may be down on my luck now,
175
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,600
but I'm Idate, the number one
henchman of the Wasabi Family!
176
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,800
Rest easy and leave it all to me!
177
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,350
Yeah, right.
178
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,140
We should start seeing
Nagi Island’s port soon.
179
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,850
I hope we can get there
before Fukusuke.
180
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,010
Hey, Naruto…
What do you think?
181
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,930
Hm? What about?
182
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,840
That Idate…
183
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,600
He’s definitely not
an ordinary man.
184
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,720
He can run extraordinarily fast.
185
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,050
He could have received
special training…
186
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,640
What kind of training?
187
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,840
Like, maybe he’d been
in a hidden village.
188
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,840
A guy that stupid can’t be a Ninja!
189
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,890
Who’s talking here?!
You're as stupid as he is!
190
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,800
B-But…
191
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,840
I made it to the final round
of the Chunin Exam!
192
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,180
You were in the final round
of the Chunin Exam?!
193
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,600
Yeah, that’ s right!
194
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,300
If I weren’t interrupted
in the middle of it,
195
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,300
I could have won the tournament
and become a Chunin!
196
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,350
Hah!
197
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,550
Then you must have had
a darn easy proctor.
198
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,180
Really, the level of
the Chunin Exam has dropped…
199
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,140
Oh!
200
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,840
Idate, so you are…
201
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,510
I remember now!
202
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,050
Idate Morino.
203
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,840
Morino… That’s right!
204
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,550
Wasn’t the proctor
of the first test….?
205
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,850
Be quiet, you rotten runts!
206
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,890
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
207
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,680
I’m the proctor for
the first test of the Chunin Exam.
208
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,720
My name is Morino Ibiki.
209
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,050
Morino… Ibiki…
210
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,720
What did you say?
211
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,640
Brother I-Ibiki is alive?!
212
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,840
Yes…
213
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,140
Of course, he’s alive!
214
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,640
He gave me a weird problem
on the 10th question…
215
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Is that true?
He really is alive?!
216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,390
Wh-What’s this?!
217
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,100
An ambush!
218
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,010
How is it?
219
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,010
As you can see,
it’s right in front of us.
220
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,390
Then, let’s get started
on our plan!
221
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,100
Darn!
222
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Naruto and I will chase them away!
223
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,180
Sakura, take care of Idate!
224
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,800
Isn’t it better to run…?
225
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Too late for that!
226
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,600
I’ll cover you. Remove the ropes!
227
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,840
Gotcha!
228
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,260
Darn! I have to cut these!
229
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,890
Darn it! I lost them all that time!
230
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,840
Hey, lend me that thing!
231
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,300
What?!
232
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,100
Just hand it to me, hurry!
233
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,100
Bastard, this is more important
than my life.
234
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,100
There’s no way
I’ll let you use it…
235
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,470
This is no time to be saying
stuff like that!
236
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,840
S-Stop you idiot!
237
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,970
Hurry up, you loser!
238
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,760
Heh, piece of cake!
239
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,840
Sakura! They are just clones!
240
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,840
Only the real one can attack you,
so don’t worry!
241
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,600
Sharingan!
242
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,180
Sakura, Naruto!
243
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,550
The real ones are hiding among
the clones! Be careful!
244
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,840
Sasuke! Guide us!
245
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,430
Idate, stay close to me!
246
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,470
Hah! I don’t want a Ninja’s help!
247
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,550
Are you still saying that
in this situation?!
248
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,850
Naruto! Behind you!
249
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,680
Naruto!
250
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,180
A clone?!
251
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,140
Oh, shoot!
252
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,840
– Clone for clone!
– Clone for clone!
253
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,930
Damn, they got away.
254
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,220
Nice work! Naruto!
255
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,600
That Shadow Clone kid
is troublesome.
256
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,760
The next plan, Kagari!
257
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,760
We’ll kill them all!
258
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Water Style!
Black Rain Jutsu!
259
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,300
Sasuke! They’ve changed
into Water Clones!
260
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,840
I know!
261
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,850
Rain?
262
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,840
No! This is oil!
263
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,760
How annoying!
I’ll get rid of them all at once!
264
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,840
That’s Tiger Seal!
265
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,680
Sasuke, no!
266
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Oops…
267
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,470
Unlucky…
268
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,850
Humph, not really.
269
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,840
Fire attack?!
270
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,720
B-Brother…
271
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,970
Go! Having you stay will be
a burden to me!
272
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,050
B-Brother…
273
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,890
Idate?
274
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,680
N-Nothing!
275
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,800
Sasuke, what can we do?!
276
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,470
If the fire is this strong…
277
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,850
We’ll have to dive in
to the ocean!
278
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,840
From here, we can swim
to the port of Nagi Island!
279
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,930
Right! There’s no other option left.
280
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,640
Idate, can you swim?
281
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,100
Y-Yeah…
282
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Hurry! I’ll cover you, so go first!
283
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,010
This smoke should help you
escape unnoticed!
284
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,220
Idate?!
285
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,470
There’s no way!
286
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,300
Wha--?
287
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,300
You are tricking me into
becoming a decoy!
288
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,720
What are you talking about?!
289
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,840
You’re trying to get
the enemy’s attention to me!
290
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,720
That’s nonsense!
291
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,840
No! I don’t trust Ninja!
292
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,050
What are you doing? Go!
293
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,180
Having you stay will be
a burden to us!
294
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,220
Go! Having you stay
is a burden!
295
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,760
Hurry up and go!
296
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,100
There’s no way we will
use you as a decoy!
297
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,850
N-No…
298
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,720
Cha!
299
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,350
Idate! Duck down!
300
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,510
Trust me Idate!
I promise I’ll protect you!
301
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,600
Watch out!
302
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,890
Sa…!
303
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
Sakura!
304
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,840
S-Sakura…
305
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,390
Go on ahead…
306
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,350
We’ll follow you right after!
307
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,840
A-All right…
308
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,840
Well, shall we withdraw now?
309
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,640
Withdraw?
310
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,180
The most enjoyable part
is still left undone.
311
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,640
Darn, they are
unexpectedly tenacious.
312
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,680
Yeah. But we won’t
let them get away.
313
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,600
I-I should be okay here…
314
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
Long time no see, Idate.
315
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,800
Y-You are…
316
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,720
I have taught you so many times
not to trust anyone.
317
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,100
Such a fool, you are…
318
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,930
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
319
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,430
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
320
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,600
On your still shoulder
321
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,220
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
322
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,840
The city lights are like pieces of stars
323
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,720
That hold us together
324
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:58,350
“Each one of us glows differently,”
325
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,010
you say laughingly
326
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,890
but you look most dazzling
327
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,840
Like a comet,
328
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:18,010
like the rainbow after the storm
329
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:25,220
You bring light into my heart
330
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:35,680
Being lost can be the answer
331
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:44,510
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
332
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,600
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
333
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,970
Fool or whatever…
lt doesn't matter now how you used to be.
334
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,840
This race is not over yet!
335
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,800
You'll never know unless
you try 'til the very end!
336
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,600
Boss Jirocho believes in you.
337
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,430
If you have time to stall and act cool,
why don't you show some guts?!
338
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,300
Next time: "Run Idate Run!
Nagi Island Awaits!
//%
1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,550
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,350
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,470
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,760
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,300
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,930
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,550
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,970
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,590
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,590
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,180
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,590
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,640
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,590
Byakugan!
16
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,590
Why did you take down Naruto
with her?!
17
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,050
It was an accident…
18
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,100
Had I not applied the finishing blow
to her at the moment,
19
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,140
we would’ve been in danger instead.
20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,010
I know of no instance
21
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,760
of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
being defeated up until now…
22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,590
He will be missed.
23
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,050
Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
your mission is over.
24
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,590
I still haven’t taken back the star.
25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,010
We’ll search for it by ourselves.
Thank you for your help.
26
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,470
Hoshikage: The Buried Truth
27
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,010
Rest easy…
I’m not an enemy.
28
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,300
Come to think of it…
What happened after I fell off the cliff?
29
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,850
Could it be…?
Did you save me, lady?
30
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,930
Yes…
31
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,970
I see.
I don’t really remember, though…
32
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,470
Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks.
33
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,010
I’m Naruto, a Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves and…
34
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,640
Umm, I came to protect the star, but…
35
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,050
You kind of stole it, lady…
36
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,180
I’m Natsuhi…
37
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,590
Natsuhi? What?
I’ve heard that name before…
38
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,350
Oh!
39
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,590
That red star’s sure pretty.
40
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,800
Natsuhiboshi…
lt watches over me all the time.
41
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,800
It’s the same name
as Natsuhiboshi.
42
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,300
If I remember right,
43
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,640
Sumaru said it’s a star
that protects him!
44
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,550
Sumaru said that?
45
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,430
Yeah! Say, lady…
Do you know him?
46
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,140
Sumaru is my child.
47
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,140
What?! So, you’re Sumaru’s mom?!
48
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,300
What?! Sumaru escaped?!
49
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,260
I am very sorry.
50
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,300
I was careless thinking
the muscle relaxants were still in effect.
51
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,300
Most likely the guys from
the Hidden Leaf
52
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,600
are the ones who took him away…
53
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,890
What do we do?
54
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,590
It’d be bad news if these circumstances
were to be known
55
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,350
by the Leaf, no,
by those in our village.
56
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,180
We’ve got to look high and low
for Sumaru right away.
57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,220
There’s no need to get rattled…
58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,970
We can take care of them at
our leisure after we find the star.
59
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,510
I got it. If we tell the Village Hidden
in the Leaves something like
60
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,180
they died during the mission…
61
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,590
We could also convince Sumaru.
62
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,720
I burned Natsuhi’s Chakra
into my memory…
63
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,350
We’ll reach the star
64
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,640
if we follow the remnants
of her Chakra.
65
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,760
Naruto was…?
66
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,050
Yeah. Along with the Kunoichi
who stole the star.
67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,010
But I didn’t see them
in the Valley of Death…
68
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,590
Are you saying they escaped from
the valley
69
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,890
where the poison gas swirls?
70
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,720
Perhaps.
71
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,590
If that’s the case,
72
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,590
they might have crossed the border
and escaped safely to the forest…
73
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,100
Hey, let’s all look for them!
74
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,590
What’s the deal, guys?!
75
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,720
Naruto helped all of you,
didn’t he?!
76
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,590
But if we don’t have an order
from Lord Akahoshi… Right?
77
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,010
Yeah…
78
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,350
We don’t have time to be waiting
for an order! I’m going!
79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,010
I’m going…
80
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,390
I’ll go too, if it’s to look for Naruto.
81
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,140
Mizura, you can’t.
82
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,050
I want to be useful in some way.
83
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,760
No… I’ll go.
84
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,430
Sumaru?!
85
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,180
You’re okay!
86
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,930
We safely rescued him from
the Hoshikage’s medical room
87
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,800
where he was being held!
88
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,350
What? Why was he in
Lord Hoshikage’s medical room?
89
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,590
It wasn’t a Ninja from
some other village
90
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,800
who knocked you all out
and took Sumaru away!
91
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,140
Akahoshi, the leader of your village
was the culprit!
92
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,590
In other words, the Shinobi
who made off with the star
93
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,640
and the Shinobi who attacked all
of you were different people.
94
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,720
That’s what Neji deduced
word for word.
95
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,930
Why would Lord Akahoshi…?
96
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,390
Why would he do that to us?
97
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,350
What does this mean, Sumaru?
98
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,970
I don’t know, either!
99
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,590
But it seems Lord Akahoshi
is hiding something from us…
100
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,470
Isn’t it about time you guys realized it?
101
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,590
Akahoshi’s using you as he pleases.
102
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,890
Mizura is not the exception.
103
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,800
If you guys continue
training this way,
104
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,590
everyone will collapse and then…
105
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
No way…
106
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,930
It can’t be. That’s a lie!
107
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,890
Lord Akahoshi is not that
kind of person, ever!
108
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,300
Perhaps the Shinobi
who stole the star will tell the truth.
109
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,590
Let’s find the Shinobi who disappeared,
whatever the cost!
110
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,590
The forest in the Land of Bears
is deep.
111
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,510
If only outsiders go,
they’d just get lost.
112
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,430
Okay, work with us.
113
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,100
So leave this to me.
114
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,350
But…
115
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,930
You rest now.
116
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,760
At some point, the time will come
when we’ll need your help.
117
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,430
How about it, Akahoshi…?
118
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,680
Were you able to get a lead on
the remnants of Natsuhi’s Chakra?
119
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,850
This is good.
120
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,300
I guess this is what’s called
good old home-cooking.
121
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,140
There’s more.
122
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,720
One more bowl!
123
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,180
But why’d you do something like
steal the star, Sumaru’s mom?
124
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,050
This is not the first and only time
I took that away.
125
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,300
Ten years ago as well…
126
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,510
Huh…?
127
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,590
Training utilizing that star was painful
for many Shinobi at the time
128
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,550
and even caused many deaths.
129
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,100
My husband Hotarubi and I
who survived the training…
130
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:23,050
thought to seal the star to prevent
any more victims due to the training.
131
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,390
A Tracking Unit immediately caught up
with us after we had stolen the star.
132
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,510
Hold it!
133
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,800
Lord Third Hoshikage…
134
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,680
Hotarubi…Natsuhi…
Your thoughts are reasonable…
135
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,760
As it happens, I was also wavering.
136
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,800
But in the position of Hoshikage,
it was difficult to make a decision.
137
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,890
I promise to terminate
the star training.
138
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,800
But the hard-line faction
of the Star Village
139
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,050
might at some point
resume the training…
140
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,510
You two must leave this village!
141
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,510
I want you to keep an eye on
the village from the outside.
142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,970
And if it seems that the training
will begin once again…
143
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,600
Please stop it with
your power.
144
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,550
Lord Hoshikage…
145
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,760
For Sumaru…
146
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,590
Tell Sumaru that…we died.
Please be good to him.
147
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,050
Yes, I understand.
148
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,680
Upon allowing us to leave the village,
149
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,220
the Lord Third Hoshikage completely
prohibited the star training.
150
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,010
Like us, the Third Hoshikage
was also distressed
151
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,390
at the damage from
the star training.
152
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,640
Neji was also talking about that.
153
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,590
But are the effects from
the star that severe?!
154
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,050
Yes. My husband Hotarubi died
due to side effects
155
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,720
a while after leaving the village…
156
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,590
I might also die at any time
from the effects.
157
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,850
No way…
158
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,600
Then let’s go back to
the village!
159
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,140
Tell Akahoshi directly to
stop the training!
160
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,590
Akahoshi is a man who puts
the prosperity of the village
161
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,220
ahead of the lives of
the children.
162
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,800
As proof of that,
he has taken Sumaru hostage
163
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,470
and has demanded that
I return the star.
164
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,430
What?! Then the masked Ninja
from that time was…
165
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,260
Hold it!
166
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,300
Farewell!
167
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Wh-What?!
168
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,590
It was Akahoshi?!
169
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,180
What is it, Sumaru’s mom?
170
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,590
They’ve… 					Akahoshi has come.
171
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,590
Is this the place?
172
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,590
Where’s the star being hidden?
173
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,930
Hotarubi… Please protect
the star, protect Sumaru…
174
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,800
The star is under that rock…
175
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,720
But it seems the entrance
is sealed…
176
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,590
What can we do with
a boulder like this…?
177
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,350
Our only choice is to blow it up
little by little with Letter Bombs.
178
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,180
I won’t let you do that!
179
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,930
Wha--?!
180
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,600
Didn’t this brat die in
the Valley of Death?
181
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,050
I won’t be done in just like that,
believe it!
182
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,680
You guys step back.
183
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,010
Then I just have to do it again.
184
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,590
Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast!
185
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,050
Here we go!
186
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,600
You’re mine!
187
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,140
I saw that move coming!
Become a sacrifice for my beast!
188
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,590
What?!
189
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,010
Natsuhi… So you were alive too,
after all, huh?
190
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,760
Akahoshi, reconsider one more time…
191
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,760
If you stop the star training
and release the children,
192
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,720
I’ll have no more to do
with the village…
193
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,140
I don’t think so!
194
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,350
The Third Hoshikage was stubborn
195
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,050
and never wavered
in his opposition.
196
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,300
Opposition to those of us
who trained Star Ninja
197
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,600
and attempted to bring prosperity
to the village…
198
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,800
No! As long as I,
the Third Hoshikage, am alive,
199
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,430
the resumption of that training
will never be allowed!
200
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,390
Return to your posts… That is all.
201
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,260
Have you lost your mind…
202
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,590
Akahoshi?
203
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,890
You’re the one who’s lost his mind!
204
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,890
Rest easy and go to
the other world…
205
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,010
Our generation will
raise this village
206
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,590
to rival that of
the Five Great Hidden Villages…
207
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,680
Was this…really okay?
208
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,590
It was necessary for the sake
of the village, right?
209
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,300
Exactly! We can do star training
as we please.
210
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,590
Unforgivable!
211
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,850
What do you think of all those
who are training frantically,
212
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,010
believing in you guys?!
213
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,470
One’s even on the verge of dying!
Do you understand that?!
214
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,800
Sacrifice is unavoidable for
the sake of village prosperity.
215
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,800
A Shinobi is merely a tool for that.
216
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,970
For the sake of village prosperity?
217
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,140
Knock it off!
218
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,140
All you’re doing is deceiving
the people in the village!
219
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,140
This is a Star Village issue…
I will settle this.
220
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,590
B-But…!
221
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,680
Step back!
222
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,510
Yotaka, Shisou!
223
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,220
Wha--?! He devoured
his comrades’ Chakra!
224
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,760
My Chakra beast has a full stomach.
225
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,220
Things won’t go as they did before.
226
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,640
Talk is cheap!
227
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,350
Sumaru’s mom…
228
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,890
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
229
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,590
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
230
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,220
Yellow Moon.
231
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:59,050
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
232
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,260
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
233
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:11,220
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
234
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:18,100
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
235
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:24,800
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
236
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,590
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
237
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,350
A magical chord change, in a restless city
238
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,390
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
239
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,390
Neji, how’s Sumaru’s mom doing?
240
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,680
She’s stable for now,
241
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,260
but her condition can worsen
at any moment.
242
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,050
What?
243
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,050
Her Chakra Network that had
already been weakened
244
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,510
due to the side-effects of the star
before she received Akahoshi’s attack.
245
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,590
In other words,
her Chakra Network is all beat up?
246
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,140
Hey, Granny Tsunade
could heal her, right?
247
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,930
I don’t know.
248
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,590
But either way,
249
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,430
if she were to use
the Ninja Art: Kujaku any further,
250
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,680
there’s no guarantee she’ll live.
251
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,430
Next time:
"Reunion: The Remaining Time"
//%
1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,450
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,250
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,370
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,660
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,200
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,830
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,450
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,870
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,490
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,490
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,080
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,490
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,540
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,830
Say, Grandma Tsunada,
am I really so…?
16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,500
Come to think of it, recently I feel dull
17
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,490
and I make more mistakes
with Jutsu than before.
18
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,000
And, what’s more, even worse…
19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,620
I can’t eat more than five of
the large-size ramen noodles at Ichiraku…
20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,910
Might I perhaps have
some terrible illness?!
21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,490
Come on, and tell me.
I’m prepared to hear the worst!
22
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,080
You are in good health.
23
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,000
Huh?
24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,620
Hey! That’s Bushy Brow’s
medical record, isn’t it?
25
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,200
Recently he’s been avoiding
his regular check-ups.
26
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,290
Bring him in, will you?
27
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,330
Huh? But, what about me…?
28
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,040
You are stupid. That’s all!
29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Be on your way!
30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,080
– Put your clothes back on, you idiot!
– Yes!
31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,200
Unbelievable!
32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,500
How was it?
33
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,450
I’m fit as a fiddle!
34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,490
I could tell that just by looking at you.
35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,160
What’s that all about?
36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
He doesn’t seem to be in
a very good mood, does he?
37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,330
Oh, by the way,
have you seen Bushy Brow?
38
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,120
No, but I know where he is.
39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,700
These days,
you can always find him here.
40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,910
Oh…
41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,160
2954… 2955…
42
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,290
2956… 2957… 2958…
43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,910
That’s just amazing…
44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,910
Even after having surgery
for the kind of injury
45
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,910
that could prevent him from
continuing on as a Ninja…
46
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,870
– Bushy Brow! 					– Lee!
47
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,830
Bushy Brow!
48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,000
Lee…
49
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,660
It’s nothing.
50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,330
Grandma Tsunada told me to bring you
for your regular check-up.
51
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:41,000
It slipped my mind.
I’ve been feeling fine lately, so I just…
52
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,370
You don’t look like it though.
53
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,540
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL
54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,490
Rest for a while.
55
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,250
You are forbidden from engaging in
any missions or training for the duration.
56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,450
There is cumulative damage
to your Chakra Network.
57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,490
You were once injured so badly
58
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,950
that you had to give up on being
a Ninja for a while.
59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,490
It’s my self-rule.
60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,910
Your self-rule?
61
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,450
Yes! To never forget
my original intentions!
62
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,700
As long as I keep on trying,
I will be able to continue on as a Ninja!
63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,540
All right.
64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,700
I will remove you from active duty
for a while,
65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,490
but you may continue training.
Just don't overdo it.
66
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,370
Yes!
67
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,450
In particular,
I prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus!
68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,830
Got that?
69
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,490
Y-Yes…
70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,160
Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go?
71
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,700
What’s wrong? Hey!
72
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,490
The results were bad.
73
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,750
Judging from the way he looked,
I’d say considerably…
74
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,000
By “considerably,”
do you mean that “considerably”?
75
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,370
Yes.
Considerable, to be sure.
76
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,200
Considerable?!
77
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,490
What are you so down about?! Lee!
78
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,490
Guy Sensei!
79
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,290
I heard the results of the exam.
You have permission to train, don’t you?
80
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes, but the Hidden Lotus…
81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,490
That day, you were crying right there…
82
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,910
Your surgery will be a success
83
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,490
because you have worked hard
all the way through.
84
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,750
You have the power to bring
your own future in the heavens.
85
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,490
And in the one in a thousand—
86
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,250
no, one in a million chance
that something goes wrong…
87
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,830
I’m going to die with you!
88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,120
Ever since the time I met you,
89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,700
my Way of Ninja has been
bringing you up to be a fine Ninja.
90
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,580
I promise you!
91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,250
You believed me then and had the surgery.
And it was successful.
92
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,490
You must have faith in me
one more time!
93
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,910
If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus,
94
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,490
then strive to attain an even
greater technique through your efforts!
95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,540
There are no limits in
the face of your efforts.
96
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,700
Sensei!
97
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,870
You are a genius at effort!
98
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,490
Yes, sir!
99
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,490
I'll give you some training for
the first time in quite a spell!
100
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,330
First, dash to the Academy practice hall!
101
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,490
Please instruct me!
102
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,040
If you don’t get there in ten seconds,
it’s 500 push-ups!
103
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,870
Right!
104
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,490
The Third Super-Beast!
105
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,490
It was rash of us to think we could
make it in ten seconds, after all.
106
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,910
Just as well!
107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,490
Five hundred…
108
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,250
It’s been a long time since
I smelled this smell…
109
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,870
Who is he?
110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,700
That’s Yagura.
He’s been here for a week.
111
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,790
An acquaintance asked me to determine
whether he has aptitude as a Ninja.
112
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,080
His name is Yagura, you say?
113
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,790
He’s pretty good, isn’t he?
114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,410
Yes, he has the instincts for it.
115
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,910
He absorbs the things I teach him
like sand absorbs water.
116
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,950
Oh! You’re Rock Lee, aren’t you?
117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,250
Y-Yes…
118
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,950
I hear that you have superb techniques.
119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sensei has told me about you.
120
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,540
No, nothing that great…
121
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,870
Don’t be bashful, you.
122
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,950
– Master Guy? 					– Yes?
123
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,290
I would like to receive some instruction
from my senior.
124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,120
Fine, then. Begin!
125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,750
Huh?!
126
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,200
Guy Sensei!
127
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,250
You came to train, anyway.
128
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,000
First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner
and warm up.
129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,950
I see…
130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,790
He’s a spring chick who has just arrived,
so try not to let him get hurt.
131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,910
Right.
132
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,660
What’s Bushy Brow doing in
the Academy practice hall of all places?
133
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,000
I thought his condition was
considerably bad!
134
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,250
Yes, considerably! Considerably!
135
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,490
– Huh?! 					– Huh?
136
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,490
I’m inexperienced,
but please instruct me.
137
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, please bear with me, too.
138
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,250
Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you both
to give it all you've got
139
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,450
but to also observe
the greatest courtesy.
140
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,490
That is friendship!
That is youth. Get ready. Fight!
141
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,870
H-He’s fast!
142
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,490
Let’s have you show me…
143
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,490
The depth of the Taijutsu that
Might Guy drilled into you!
144
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,790
What power!
145
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,910
Every single blow is heavy!
146
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,450
I haven’t the strength to absorb them!
147
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,750
Leaf Hurricane!
148
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,290
Closing off the escape path above
and strike from a low position…
149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
However…
150
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,490
The Leaf Hurricane was defeated!
151
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,120
Stop! Hold it right there!
152
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,000
Lee! Are you all right?
153
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,580
Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow!
154
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,700
What was that that just happened?
155
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,120
The Cross Method…
156
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,490
Meeting the opponent’s kick
157
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,490
and pinning his foot between
the knee and elbow simultaneously—
158
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
a “bone-crushing daring technique .”
159
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,950
Where on earth
did you learn that, Yagura!
160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,450
I didn’t intend to do that.
161
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,080
My body just moved
like that involuntarily…
162
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,450
Sorry, Lee. Are you all right?
163
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,490
If Lee hadn’t been wearing his weights,
his ankle would have been crushed.
164
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,950
It was a splendid move.
Well then, let’s continue with the practice.
165
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,490
Let’s stop here for today.
166
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,500
I’ll take you to the hospital to
have them look at it.
167
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,490
No, I’m completely fine, I tell you…
168
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,250
We knew from the health check-up
169
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,540
that Bushy Brow’s injuries were
considerable to begin with, didn’t we?
170
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,490
Considerable!
171
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,580
What was considerable?
172
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,660
I’m telling you,
just considerable, right?!
173
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,410
– Probably considerable…
– Considerable, I tell you!
174
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,490
Even with the weights on, that speed…
175
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,950
What was considerable?!
176
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,450
Fortunately, there’s nothing wrong
with the bone.
177
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,410
I see.
178
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,540
Um… When can I begin training again?
179
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,080
Huh? What are you saying?!
180
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,700
You’re going to need complete rest
for a while.
181
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,540
It’s amazing that your Achilles tendon
remained uninjured, you know…
182
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,500
You said considerable, so…
183
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,870
I misunderstood it to mean that
he was in a considerable condition.
184
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,450
But…
185
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,200
he came out from the examining room
looking very down,
186
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,830
so I just assumed…
187
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,200
To be sure, he seems dispirited.
188
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,410
He was beaten by a trainee
who isn’t even enrolled in the Academy.
189
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,580
A trainee? Lee?
190
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsu
for only one week.
191
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,490
In any case,
he was incredibly skilled, that…
192
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,370
What’s it called…?
193
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,490
The Cross Method!
194
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,500
Yes, that!
195
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,330
He's a genius to deploy
that at the instant!
196
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,700
I hope Lee isn’t feeling down, though.
197
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,490
If he were the kind of guy to get
downhearted about a thing like that,
198
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,620
Lee would have quit being
a Shinobi a long time ago.
199
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
– Huh? 					– Huh?
200
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,450
When Lee was in the Academy,
201
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,000
he was told that he had neither
the talent for Ninjutsu,
202
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,160
nor any talent for Genjutsu.
203
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,450
Had it been me,
I would have given up long ago.
204
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,490
But Lee got to where he is now purely
through effort and persistence.
205
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,490
If he can just heal his injuries,
206
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,620
he’ll soon outstrip anyone with
natural talent alone.
207
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,620
– That’s true.
– Darn right!
208
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,830
But…
209
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,290
I’ve heard that if you train too hard,
210
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,490
you can wreck your body and
become a decrepit…
211
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,660
Don't say such a thing!
You’re talking about Bushy Brow!
212
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,910
I’m only kidding.
Just a slip of the tongue.
213
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,200
– Don’t even say that in jest!
– Decrepit?
214
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,490
I know, I know.
215
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,330
But actually, we are grateful to Lee.
216
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,870
Huh? Grateful?
217
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,830
Yes, grateful.
218
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,490
Okay, today I’m going to teach you
about self-rule.
219
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,490
Self…
220
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,250
…rule, you say?
221
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,910
Yes! Yes! Yes!
222
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,660
Please teach me! Me! Me!
223
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,950
All right, ready?
224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,290
To all things there are principles,
225
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,580
and to efficiently make use of things
in daily life, human beings have rules.
226
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,250
Okay, today I have something good
to give you all.
227
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,330
– Something… 					– …good?
228
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,700
This!
229
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,330
O-Oh!
230
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,500
These tights of the type that
I habitually use…!
231
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,490
They have outstanding ventilation
and moisture-wicking properties!
232
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,250
Developed for ultimate ease of movement,
it's a complete of of super-athletic wear!
233
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,700
If you wear them when you’re training,
you’ll feel the difference immediately!
234
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,000
You won’t be able to do without them!
235
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,330
Next thing you know,
you’ll be wearing them all the time!
236
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,580
Yes, yes, yes!
Please, by all means, give me a pair!
237
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,120
Oh, I got a pair of those myself.
They look cool, don’t they?
238
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh… Is that so?
239
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,750
If it weren’t for Lee…
240
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,490
This is youth!
241
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,790
This is guts!
242
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,830
This is Harutaro Minami,
spring chicken of the South!
243
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,490
– You got that all wrong!
– You got that all wrong!
244
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,660
I’m really glad that we’ve had Lee around.
245
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,490
Yeah, me too…
246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,290
I’m sure a C-rank mission would
feel insufficient for you,
247
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,620
but there’s nobody left to ask but you.
248
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,490
Leave it to me.
249
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,490
Oh, by the way,
there’s someone I’d like to take with me…
250
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,040
Yagura!
251
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,910
When my foot heals,
let’s train together aga--?
252
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,450
I feel no need to take lessons from you.
253
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,120
Even ruling out the fact that
you were wearing weight,
254
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,000
there seems to be nothing worth
stealing from you…
255
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,580
Stealing?
256
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,870
After all, skills acquired
purely through effort
257
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,200
make you nothing
but a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.
258
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,540
What did you say?!
259
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,500
As proof of that,
even Sensei has given up on you.
260
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,490
That can’t be!
261
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,290
Guy Sensei promised me…
262
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,080
that his own Way of Ninja was to
turn me into a splendid Ninja, too!
263
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Well then, I wonder why he’s gone
so far as to ask me
264
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,540
to come on a mission with him
for practical training…
265
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,700
Not you, but me!
266
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,490
You?
267
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,580
Too bad. There’s no way effort
can win out over talent.
268
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,080
Wait!
269
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,950
Did Sensei really asked you to…?
270
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,510
No, it…can’t be true…
271
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,590
Lady Tsunade!
272
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,800
Wh-What is it?
273
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,800
Yagura has been injured and
is under protection.
274
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,010
What? Guy was with him.
What on earth happened?
275
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,350
No! Yagura is said to have been attacked
before reaching Hidden Leaf Village.
276
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,850
Then the trainee Yagura
that accompanied Guy is…
277
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,590
A total imposter.
278
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,600
Damn it, one nuisance after another…!
279
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,590
So, these three are the ones
that can be mobilized?
280
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,600
What shall we do?
281
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,800
Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and Naruto…
282
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,510
these three go after Guy
and the phony Yagura!
283
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,350
Right!
284
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,390
Wait!
285
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,550
Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee.
286
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,590
If he learns about this,
287
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,390
he’s apt to dash out,
even in the shape he’s in.
288
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,390
Right!
289
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,590
Are you sure that Intense Brow Sensei
went this way?
290
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,590
Without a doubt!
291
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,140
His destination was
the Land of Mountain Streams.
292
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,590
He must have gone through this forest.
293
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,800
There’s another way to go,
cutting through the mountains,
294
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,260
but it’s too dangerous.
295
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,590
Yagura, are you with me?
296
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,300
Yes, Guy Sensei!
297
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,590
Don’t slow down!
298
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,760
Take each step after first taking
the measure of the mountain terrain!
299
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,600
Right!
300
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,590
Lee could run through here blindfolded.
301
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,220
What’s wrong? Yagura?
302
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,260
Oh no!
303
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,850
Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura!
304
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,390
Yagura!
305
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
He may be a genius,
but he’s still a trainee…
306
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,390
I wonder if I expected
too much from him…
307
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,850
Yagura!
308
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,180
What? Were you in such a place?
309
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,600
Wooden Training Dummies
for kung fu training…
310
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,590
Oh my… It takes me back to my youth.
311
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,050
I trained with a burning spirit on
the same kinds of Wooden Dummies.
312
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,550
It makes my body to just start
moving uncontrollably.
313
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,180
But why are there Wooden Dummies
in such a place?
314
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,760
Who in the world…?
315
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,680
And for what purpose?
316
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,390
They move well for dummies.
317
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,010
But, after all, they just look
like automated dolls.
318
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,640
They only have one pattern of movement,
319
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,930
and no matter
how many of them there are,
320
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,590
their reach only extends for
a diameter of 3.5 meters,
321
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,930
so they cannot attack.
322
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,430
What? Mister, you can move?!
323
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,800
What the heck?!
324
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,640
Hey? Can’t you see anything yet? Neji!
325
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,720
Even using the Byakugan,
I can’t find a single footprint.
326
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,590
They can’t have gotten that far away,
can they?
327
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,850
They wouldn't have used excessively
dangerous mountain paths either…
328
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,760
However they seem to be able to move,
329
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,260
they’re just stick figures crawling
over the surface of the ground…
330
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,390
Mister, you can jump, too?!
331
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,510
Not just yet!
332
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,390
Wh-What a…!
333
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,180
pleasant, high-energy training place…!
334
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:09,100
6,985… 6,986… 6,987… 6,988
335
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,590
6,989… 6,990… 6,991…
336
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,100
– There is no limit to training.
– 6,992…
337
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,680
– Even if I cannot use my legs,
– 6,993…
338
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
– my upper half is still in good shape.
– 6,994…
339
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,140
– Guy Sensei thinks…
– 6,995…
340
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,430
– my training is inadequate.
– 6,996…
341
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,600
– That’s why he compared me with Yagura.
– 6,997… 6,996…
342
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,590
– to show me that I wasn't doing enough.
– 6,998… 6,999…
343
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,590
7,000!
344
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,010
– I have faith in Guy Sensei!
– 7,001… 7,002…
345
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,350
They’re moderately powerful, but…
346
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,050
their movements are monotonous.
347
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,470
Or…so I thought…!
348
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,590
Shall I say I am outnumbered?
There seems to be no limit to them!
349
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,390
Wh-What is this sound?
350
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,930
What?!
351
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,890
On a checkerboard night
352
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,510
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
353
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,890
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
354
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,050
Suggestively
355
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,800
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
356
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,590
The Trombone gradually going off-key
357
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,100
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
358
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,140
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
359
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,350
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
360
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,590
I thought I knew,
but you do have incredible power, after all.
361
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,890
To think you have such
an amazing kick.
362
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,100
Looks like I have to put out
everything in myself.
363
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,590
Then I would put everything
I've got into this too.
364
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,390
Fine! Why don’t  you come at me
with intent to beat me?!
365
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,720
Please forgive me Guy Sensei.
366
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,350
But to me, this is the moment…
367
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,850
– to follow through with my own Ninja Way!
– to follow through with my own Ninja Way!
368
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,890
Next time: “Hot-Blooded Confrontation:
Student vs. Sensei”
//%
1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,150
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,060
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,130
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,930
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,100
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,380
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,980
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,910
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,340
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,180
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,620
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,350
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,690
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,090
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,000
If “Heaven” does not exist,
20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,770
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.
21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,730
If “Earth” does not exist,
22
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,500
run the fields in search
of an advantage.
23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,540
Open the series of Heaven and Earth,
and the perilous way shall be redressed…
24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,340
This is namely the secret of
“the one that guides…”
25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,210
What’s that?
26
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,820
It probably has to do with the scroll.
27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,990
I think this means we’re supposed
to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,170
Okay then, I’m going to open it.
29
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,180
Huh? What’s this?
30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,580
A man…?
31
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,850
A person…?
32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,630
This is…a Summoning Jutsu!
33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,860
Naruto! Sakura!
Let go of the scroll!
34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Oh...
35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,580
Wha--?!
36
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,550
Y-You…
37
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,560
Hi!
38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
It’s been a long time.
39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,500
Surviving the Cut!
The Rookie Nine Together Again!
40
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,470
W-What’s going on?
41
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,110
It appears you guys have had
a rough time of it.
42
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,380
What?!
43
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,320
Why are you appearing with
a Summoning?
44
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,550
At the end of this second exam,
45
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,520
we Chunin are to
welcome the test-takers.
46
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,860
I just happened to be given
47
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,130
the important task of being
the messenger for you guys.
48
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,400
Messenger…?!
49
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,140
Just in time.
50
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,540
Everyone…
51
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,880
Congratulations on surviving
the second exam.
52
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,620
To celebrate your passing,
53
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,320
I’d like to treat you to
some Ichiraku ramen, but…
54
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,690
Ohh... Cool!
55
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
Uh-oh…
56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,420
H-Hey, Naruto!
57
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,560
– Listen to the end…
– Cool! Cool!
58
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,460
Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!
59
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,900
I’ve done great job!
I’m the greatest!
60
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,800
I so want to eat ramen!
Believe it!
61
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,770
He’s got so much energy.
62
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,870
Yaaaay!
63
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,080
Shut up!
64
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,550
Man, that scatterbrained part
of you is the same as always, eh.
65
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,050
I see.
66
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,920
Huh?
67
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,590
If we had looked at the scroll
in the middle of the exam,
68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,890
what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
69
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,270
Sasuke, you’re a sharp one,
as usual.
70
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,510
You guessed right.
71
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,540
The rules of this exam were to test
your conclusive mission execution ability.
72
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,550
To put it simply,
73
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,690
in the case of the scrolls being opened
contrary to the rules…
74
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,750
In the case of them being opened…?
75
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,560
I was ordered to knock unconscious
the test-takers in front of me
76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,400
until the end of the exam.
77
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,540
Good thing you didn’t open the scroll.
78
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,870
Kabuto, thank you!
79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Phew!
80
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,550
That was seriously close…
81
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,820
Oh yeah, Sensei!
82
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,820
Huh?
83
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,550
By the way,
what’re the letters on that wall?
84
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,220
They’re kind of vermiculated and
85
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,690
we don’t understand
their meaning at all.
86
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,860
Never mind, never mind!
87
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,800
We passed!
88
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,540
No…explaining that is
one more of my duties.
89
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,470
What, really?
90
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,540
I’m saying that’s right.
91
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,340
Give it a read.
92
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,980
These are Chunin instructions
Master Hokage recorded.
93
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,750
Instructions?!
94
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,020
That’s right!
95
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,190
Heaven in this text
refers to the human head.
96
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,560
Earth refers to the human body.
97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,590
No kidding…
98
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,360
If “Heaven” does not exist,
99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,300
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.
100
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,670
In other words…
101
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,540
If your weaknesses are
inside your head, Naruto…
102
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,340
learn various logics in
preparing for your missions.
103
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,680
Hah! So meddlesome!
104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,110
If “Earth” does not exist,
105
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,650
run through the fields
in search of an advantage.
106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,850
If your weaknesses are in
your physical strength, Sakura,
107
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,560
it means you must not
slack off on your daily training.
108
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,360
And if you combine both
Heaven and Earth…
109
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,130
Any perilous mission is the right way…
110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,440
In other words…
111
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,840
what can also be called a rule
of might and become a safe mission.
112
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,840
Then, what about
the spot with the missing letter?
113
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,550
The letter refers to Chunin.
114
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,550
The one letter for “person” that
was in the scroll from earlier goes there.
115
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,390
These five days of survival
were to test
116
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,030
the test-takers’ fundamental
abilities as Chunin.
117
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,560
And you guys cleared it in fine style.
118
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,670
Chunin is of unit-leader class.
119
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,170
They have the responsibility
of leading a team.
120
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,670
Be more deeply aware of
the necessity of physical strength…
121
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,940
and knowledge in missions!
122
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,880
I want you to take on
the next step,
123
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,110
never forgetting these
Chunin instructions.
124
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,420
That is all of the messenger task
I was given.
125
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,560
Got it!
126
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,070
Huh?
127
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,980
But, as for the final third exam,
don’t push it too far.
128
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,450
Especially you, Naruto.
129
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,410
– You’re the biggest worry…
– Iruka Sensei.
130
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,320
From when I received the
Leaf headband,
131
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,590
I was no longer
an Academy student, you know?!
132
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,590
There’s nothing to worry!
Believe it!
133
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,560
Also, this is the proof you
gave me that I’m full-fledged, right?!
134
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,070
That I’m scatterbrained may
not have changed,
135
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,470
but I’m not a kid anymore!
136
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,070
I'm now...
137
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,210
A Ninja!
138
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,820
I see.
139
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,720
I’m sorry, Naruto.
140
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,430
I know their strength the best.
141
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,760
If it’s futile anyway,
142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,770
I would like to give them
the final word personally.
143
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,340
If you’re that hung up on it,
I can leave that team to you.
144
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,680
To think you’d play the devil’s advocate…
145
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,840
Thank you very much.
146
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,550
But, they’re Kakashi’s, right?
147
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,850
If he’s the one who
recommended them,
148
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,550
I thought I could count on them.
149
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,560
Stay out of it!
150
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:21,570
They’re not your students anymore.
They’re my subordinates now.
151
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,610
The one who might truly understand
152
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,810
the strength of these kids.
might be you, Kakashi.
153
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,690
How is it?
154
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,260
Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
155
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,490
No.
156
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Thanks to you,
it’s gotten quite a bit better.
157
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:59,540
Anyway, Orochimaru is one
of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
158
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,410
He’s a S-rank bingo book
rouge Shinobi
159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,140
who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right?
160
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,480
I heard that he’d already died, but…
161
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,320
Why’d he come to this village now…?
162
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,090
There’s a kid I want, you see.
163
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,400
This kid inherits the abilities
of the Uchiha clan, so…
164
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,270
It's...
165
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,540
It’s probably Sasuke, right?
166
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,680
Huh?!
167
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,940
Master Anko!
168
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,620
Twenty-one second exam
finishers have been confirmed.
169
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,390
As for the third exam, according
to the regulations of the Chunin Exams,
170
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,550
preliminaries are planned for
the first time in five years.
171
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,960
The second exam is over.
172
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,270
For the time being,
continue the exams as is,
173
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,540
but while keeping
an eye on his movements.
174
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,570
Yes…
175
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,560
First off, congratulations on
finishing the second exam.
176
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,800
There were seventy-eight
test-takers for the second exam.
177
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,730
To think twenty-one have
made it this far.
178
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,540
I said to make it less than half,
but I’d really thought about single digits.
179
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,650
I’m hungry!
180
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,920
There are still this many remaining?
181
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,560
This is such a major pain.
182
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,330
Sasuke and others have passed, too.
183
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,200
Of course…
184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,140
We went to that much trouble
to save them…
185
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,110
It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass.
186
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,450
Your team didn’t do too bad.
187
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,050
I guess they were lucky.
188
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,590
But as long as my team is around,
they can’t go any higher.
189
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,560
After all, whether you
like it or not,
190
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
ability talks at the next barrier.
191
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,530
Well, adolescence can sometimes
be bittersweet and
192
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,630
can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi…
193
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,570
Did you say something?
194
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,540
Oh my God!
195
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,810
Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
196
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,450
But that part of you is so hip...
which is what annoys me!
197
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,480
So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh?
198
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,820
Guy Sensei totally loses visually…
199
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,930
Guy Sensei is the hippest
of all the teachers!
200
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,190
He shines!
201
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,030
Okay!
202
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,800
Please watch, Guy Sensei!
I’ll shine, too!
203
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:34,990
I don’t ever want to see
tears of those dear to me again.
204
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,090
So…
205
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,720
I won’t ever lose again!
206
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Guy Sensei.
207
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,200
Sure enough, the outstanding candidates
have gathered.
208
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,130
Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
209
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,510
I’ll get you back for my arms,
Sasuke Uchiha…
210
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,540
At any cost.
211
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,230
To think a mere seven teams
are left of the twenty-six…
212
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,930
Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
213
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,900
Akamaru’s acting strange…
214
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,940
Those Sand Village guys…
215
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,550
Naruto passed, too.
216
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,820
Thank goodness…
217
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,860
What, all the Leaf Village
rookies are here.
218
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,560
Say! Say!
219
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,790
Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and
even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
220
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,260
It feels like everyone’s assembled.
221
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,430
Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling.
222
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,170
To think this many are left…
223
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies…
224
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,810
So that’s why they fought
in recommending them.
225
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,550
Now then, we will now have
the explanation of the third exam
226
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,050
from Master Hokage.
227
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,320
Listen carefully, everybody!
228
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,430
Now then, if you will,
Master Hokage.
229
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,030
All right.
230
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,140
Before the explanation of
the third exam that we will start from now,
231
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,540
I have just one thing I want
to tell everyone flat out.
232
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,020
About the true purpose of these exams.
233
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,720
True purpose…?!
234
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,160
Why do allied nations conduct
the exams on a conjoint basis?
235
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,320
Huh?
236
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,700
Raising the levels of the shinobi
and friendship among allied nations.
237
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,570
It won’t do to have the wrong idea
of the true meaning of that statement.
238
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,000
These exams are so to speak…
239
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,540
So to speak…?
240
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,620
A microcosm of battle
between allied nations.
241
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,550
What does that mean?
242
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,560
If we look back on history,
243
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,560
the allied nations of today were
once neighboring nations
244
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,460
that continued to vie with
each other and battle for power.
245
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,270
In order to avoid a futile crushing
of each others’ military strength,
246
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,210
those nations mutually selected
a place to battle.
247
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,540
And that was how the
Chunin Exams originally began.
248
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,090
W-Why do we have
to do such a thing?
249
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,090
We’re not doing this to
select Chunins?!
250
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,760
There is no question that these exams
are to select Shinobi
251
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
worthy of becoming Chunin.
252
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,230
But on the other hand,
253
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,640
these exams also provide a venue
254
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,540
for Shinobi who carry their nation’s pride
on their backs to fight for their lives!
255
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,940
Nation’s pride…?
256
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,120
Many feudal lords and those of
prominence from many nations
257
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,920
who request Shinobi for work
are invited to this third exam as guests.
258
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,560
And, the feudal lords and
Head Ninja of each Village
259
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,760
of the nations will watch your battles.
260
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,900
If the gap in national power
becomes unbridgeable,
261
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,940
the strong nations are inundated
with job requests.
262
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,970
The requests of nations deemed
weak, on the other hand, decline.
263
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,540
And therewithal,
264
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:59,350
we can exert pressure upon
each neighboring nation...
265
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,650
That is to say, just how much military
strength our Village is developing and has.
266
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,960
Even so, why is it necessary for
us to fight for our lives?!
267
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,960
The nation’s strength is
the Village’s strength.
268
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,600
The Village’s strength is
the Shinobi’s strength.
269
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,270
And the true strength of the Shinobi
is created only in a fight for one’s life!
270
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,980
This exam is a place to see
the strength of home country Shinobi,
271
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,050
and a place to display this as well.
272
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,050
It is because it’s an exam where
you truly fight for your life
273
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,320
that this has meaning.
274
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,560
It’s for this very reason that
your forerunners fought in this exam,
275
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
a dream worth striving for.
276
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,560
Then why…
use the expression “friendship”?!
277
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,130
I said it at the start, didn’t I?!
278
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,540
That it won’t do for you to have
the wrong idea of the meaning!
279
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,710
It’s a custom where balance is
preserved by fighting and removing life.
280
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,810
This is the friendship
of the Shinobi world.
281
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,480
This is a fight for life with
the pride of the village and
282
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,550
one’s own dream on the line.
283
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,400
Heh, I’m convinced.
284
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,230
Anything is fine.
285
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,540
Just tell us the content of
that fight-for-life test.
286
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,540
Very well.
287
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,810
Now then, this is where I’d like to
explain the third exam.
288
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,580
But actually…
289
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,720
Master Hokage, please allow me,
Hayate Gekko,
290
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,390
who was given the task of judge,
to speak first.
291
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,760
I leave it to you…
292
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
Nice to meet you, everyone…
293
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,900
Umm, there’s something…
I'd like you all to do...
294
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,470
before the third exam.
295
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,360
Hey, can you hear it?
296
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:30,570
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
297
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:40,110
The ocean spans limitlessly
298
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:48,490
Please keep that smile on your face forever
299
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,390
Or else I’ll cry
300
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,200
You won't have to search around you
301
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,800
It’s all ok now.
302
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:11,640
Everyone is inside
this hand
303
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,210
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
304
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,550
When you forget what happiness is
305
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,560
Just sing.
306
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,860
Light is born, and darkness was born
307
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
The two are one
308
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
309
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,140
Hey, can you hear it?
310
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,120
What's the idea?
Sudden preliminaries?
311
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,990
Didn't we just get to the tower?
Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
312
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,560
It's too much for you, Sasuke!
Please, drop out!
313
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,060
You're in no condition
to fight properly!
314
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,400
No matter what you say,
315
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,430
I'm going to tell the teachers
about that bruise.
316
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,540
Next episode: "Narrowing the Field:
Sudden Death Elimination!"
317
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,670
Sasuke, I'm scared.
//%
1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,590
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,560
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,830
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,240
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,910
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,650
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,450
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,420
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,660
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,460
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,970
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,340
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,300
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,740
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,310
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,820
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,460
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,530
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,530
Rockin' my heart
20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,440
I see. Sakura, you've come, too.
21
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,850
Now you can formally register
for the Chunin Exam.
22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,950
What do you mean?
23
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,050
Actually, from the start,
24
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,460
only three-man squads could
apply and take the exams.
25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,460
But Sensei, you said that the decision
to take the exams
26
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,030
was up to the individual.
27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,330
Yes… I said that.
28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,470
Were you lying?
29
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,870
Yes, I was…
30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,440
If I said that,
31
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,280
Sasuke and Naruto would probably
forcefully convince you to take it.
32
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,820
Even if you didn't have
the will to apply,
33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,120
if Sasuke asks you
34
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,450
you would attempt to take
the exams half-heartedly.
35
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,130
For Sasuke's sake and,
well, Naruto's.
36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,460
Then, if…
37
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,000
it had only been Sasuke and
Naruto who had come here?
38
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,370
I would've stopped the Exam here.
39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,440
I wouldn't have felt like letting
them go beyond this point.
40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,540
But…you guys came here
on your own will.
41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Sakura!
42
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,910
Naruto!
43
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,450
And, Sasuke!
44
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,950
I'm glad you came.
45
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,420
You're a team I'm proud of.
46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,760
Now then, go on!
47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,460
Okay! Let's go!
48
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,160
Genin Takedown!
All Nine Rookies Face Off!
49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,490
W-Wow!
50
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,030
W-What's with…this?
51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,240
There are so many of them…
52
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,080
Could it be that they're all applicants?
53
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,920
They…all look…immensely strong…
54
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,460
Sasuke, you're late!
55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,760
I thought I'd be able to see you
for the first time in awhile,
56
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
so I was waiting in excitement.
57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,640
Get away from Sasuke!
lno-Pig!
58
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,040
Oh, my. It's Sakura.
59
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,040
Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh…
Ugly!
60
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,540
What did you say?!
61
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,450
What's up with this?
62
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,220
Huh?
63
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,220
Are you guys going to take
this bothersome Exam, too?
64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Oh, it's the idiot trio.
65
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Quit calling us that!
66
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,360
Man, this is a freaking bother…
67
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,460
Shikamaru Nara.
68
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,500
Always complaining,
has no motivation.
69
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,330
He's a bellyaching idiot.
70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,340
Choji Akimichi.
71
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,370
He's always eating something.
72
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,440
That's all he is, a fat idiot.
73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,450
Sasuke…is mine. Bleah!
74
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,020
Ino Yamanaka.
75
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,120
She's always fighting with Sakura.
She's her rival.
76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,850
A Sasuke-crazy idiot.
77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,460
Yahoo, I found you!
78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,460
My my, everybody's here.
79
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,630
H-Hello…
80
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,200
Oh…
81
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,530
Hinata Hyuga.
82
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,700
She's a weird person who turns
her eyes away whenever I look at her!
83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,440
She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.
84
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,450
Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.
85
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,110
They're louder than I am!
86
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,050
He always brings his dog and
always has a bossy look.
87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,290
He really annoys me!
88
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,220
Shino Aburame.
89
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,460
As for this guy, I really don't get him!
90
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,530
He's a type I'm not good with.
91
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,460
What did you say?
92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,270
You guys, too?! 					 Man.
93
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,440
Ha! I see.
94
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,370
This means all nine Genin rookies
are taking the Exam, eh…!
95
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,440
Now then…
96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,740
How far can we go?
97
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,440
Eh…Sasuke?
98
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,450
Hmph!…
99
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,450
You're mighty confident. Kiba.
100
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,250
We've trained a great deal, so...
101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,120
We won't lose to you guys!
102
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,790
Shut up!
103
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,790
I don't know about Sasuke,
but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!
104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,630
I'm sorry. Naruto…
105
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,500
Kiba didn't mean it like that…
106
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,400
Huh?
107
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,970
Akamaru, you've become
tasty-looking…
108
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,440
What?
109
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,290
Don't step on it.
110
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,220
Huh?
111
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,460
I said, don't step on it.
112
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,460
You're…gonna eat that?
113
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, you guys!
114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,770
You should be a little quieter.
115
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:41,510
You guys are the "rookie nine" …
fresh out of the academy, right?
116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,410
Carrying on like that
with cute faces…Man.
117
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,450
This isn't a field trip.
118
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,280
Who're you? Acting all haughty!
119
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,450
I'm Kabuto Yakushi.
Anyway, take a good look around you.
120
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,080
Behind you…
They're from the Rain Village.
121
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,450
They're hot-tempered.
122
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,250
Everyone's tense before the Exam.
123
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,550
I thought I'd warn you guys
before you get your butts whipped…
124
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,620
I guess it can't be helped.
125
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,630
You're rookies who don't know
left from right…
126
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,700
You remind me of my old self.
127
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,700
You're Kabuto…right?
128
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,170
Yes…
129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Then, is this your second time?
130
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,710
No…
131
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,670
It's my seventh time.
132
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,010
Huh?!
133
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,750
This Exam is only held twice a year,
so it's now my fourth year.
134
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,250
Then that means you know
a lot about these exams?!
135
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,450
Kind of…
136
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,150
No kidding.
Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?
137
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
But you haven't passed.
138
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,430
Yeah, well, that is the case, yes…
139
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,630
Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?
140
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,900
Man, this is utterly bothersome…
141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,810
Then, maybe I'll give a bit of
information to my cute juniors.
142
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,010
With these Ninja Info Cards.
143
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,880
Ninja Info Cards…?
144
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,780
To put it simply,
145
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,750
they're cards that have information burned
into them and coded with Chakra.
146
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,460
I spent four whole years gathering
information for this Exam.
147
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,790
There are close to two hundred
of these cards.
148
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,660
They are pure white to the eye…
149
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,830
To open the data on these cards...
150
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,040
What're you doing?
151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,300
The way it works is that
no one can see the info
152
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,910
without using my Chakra…
153
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,440
For example…Like this…
154
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,210
\Whoa, awesome!
What information is this?
155
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,450
The number of test-takers and
participating nations,
156
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,450
and the number of applicants
from each respective village
157
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,260
is individually displayed.
158
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,760
Why do you think that
159
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,130
the Chunin Exam is jointly
conducted in the first place?
160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,440
It's said it's done to deepen
friendship among nations first
161
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,910
and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.
162
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,010
"It's said"?
163
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,150
That's right.
164
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,920
The real aim is in the checking of
Shinobi levels of neighboring nations
165
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,420
and keeping power balance equal.
166
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,290
Power…Equal?
167
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,900
Why such bothersome things?
168
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,170
If that's not done,
169
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,440
the weak nations will be invaded by
the strong nations in no time at all
170
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
and may end up being
controlled unilaterally.
171
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,280
There's a point to mutual supervision.
Probably.
172
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,550
Hmph…
173
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,210
Of those cards,
174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,320
are there ones with
detailed individual information?
175
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,950
Yes, there are…
176
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,420
Are there ones you're concerned about?
177
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Yes, there are!
178
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,460
The information for the applicants
this time around is not perfect,
179
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,460
but is burned in and saved.
180
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,670
You guys included…
181
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,000
About those "ones you're
concerned about," who you know.
182
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,310
Anything's fine, tell me their information
and I'll retrieve it for you.
183
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,450
Gaara of the Sand Village,
and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.
184
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,210
Oh, you even know names.
185
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,650
That makes it quick.
186
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
Here they are!
187
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,460
Please show me.
188
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,770
Here they are!
189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,710
Please show me.
190
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,490
I don't really get what's going on,
but I'll pretend like I do.
191
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,860
Well then, first is Rock Lee.
192
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,830
He's one year older than you guys.
193
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,470
His mission experience,
twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.
194
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,340
His squad leader is Guy…
195
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,540
In just this year, his Taijutsu
has drastically improved, but...
196
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,340
His other skills are not good at all.
197
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,150
Last year, he'd attracted attention as
a Genin rookie with his ability,
198
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,450
but didn't participate
in the Chunin Exam.
199
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,760
This is his first time taking the exams,
same as you guys…
200
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,790
Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team…
201
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,030
Huh? Hyuga?
202
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,570
Next…is Gaara of the Desert.
203
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,150
His mission experience,
eight C-ranks. B-ranks…
204
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,950
Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh…
205
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,550
He's a Shinobi from a different land
and is a rookie,
206
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,450
so there is no further
detailed information.
207
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
But…
208
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,630
It seems he has returned from
all of his missions uninjured.
209
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,470
B-rank as a Genin…
But uninjured…?!
210
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,440
What is this guy?
211
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,450
Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,
Waterfall, Sound…
212
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,960
There are lots of exceptional Genins
from those villages
213
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,520
who have come to take
the Exam this year as well.
214
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,860
As far as the Village Hidden
in Sound goes,
215
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,870
it's a village of a small nation that
just sprang up in recent years,
216
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,830
so there isn't much information…
217
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,070
At any rate,
218
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,440
they're all Hidden Villages
with nothing but crackerjacks.
219
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,450
That kind of makes you lose
your confidence.
220
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,110
Why are you saying that now?
221
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,280
In other words…
222
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,650
all of the applicants who
have gathered here…
223
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,090
That's right!
224
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,090
Not just Lee and Gaara,
225
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,230
but they're all choice top elite
Genin from each nation.
226
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,660
Hmm.
227
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,660
This isn't going to be easy.
228
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,340
I can't go along with this!
229
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,670
They may be your subordinates now,
230
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,240
but they are children
who were my students.
231
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,540
If it's about them I know…
232
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,180
It's as you say, Iruka.
233
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,780
It's not going to be that easy.
234
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,750
You're too eager.
235
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,390
I postponed my team's test-taking
for one year
236
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,950
and took care to build up
their skills.
237
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,290
Have them take the Exam after
they've enjoyed their life a little bit more.
238
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,860
Hmph…
239
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,460
They might be too easygoing.
240
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,470
But they will surpass
your guys in no time.
241
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,570
That's enough.
242
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,440
That's as far as
the rookie matter goes.
243
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,340
Now then, next…
244
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll take recommendations for Genin
other than rookies.
245
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,450
Well! Don't pour cold water on this…
246
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,450
I said that, nevertheless…
247
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,420
I wonder if even the fearless ones
are frightened just this time around.
248
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,460
Stubborn as he is,
249
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,860
he's still consumed by this atmosphere
and number of people.
250
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,160
He's tense.
251
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,130
It can't be helped.
252
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,870
Even though everyone is a Genin,
we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.
253
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm very, very uneasy.
254
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,710
But…
255
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,710
It's kind of tough looking at
Naruto who's not himself.
256
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,520
Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.
257
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,590
Say…Naruto! Don't be so scared.
258
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,460
Huh?
259
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,430
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
260
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,470
I won't lose to any of you!
Got it?!
261
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,450
Say! What's with him?!
262
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,510
That idiot would never
get depressed! Absurd!
263
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,320
It won't do any good to
provoke everyone!
264
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,450
Don't tell me!
265
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,420
If I don't tell it to you,
who do I tell it to?!
266
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,460
What did you say?!
267
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,260
Oh, I feel better.
268
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,830
Hmph…
269
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,440
Isn't that the guy from before…?
270
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,070
The dog's bark is
bigger than its bite.
271
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,670
Is he an idiot…?
272
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,010
He's mighty high-spirited.
273
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,480
He's hot-headed, eh.
274
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,250
Lee, maybe you did
not bully him enough.
275
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,450
Did you hear?
276
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,090
Sound Village is a minor
Hidden Village of a small nation.
277
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,930
That's offensive.
278
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,260
Maybe I'll…play with them a bit.
279
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,530
Yes, being referred to as something
like leftover Shinobis and all.
280
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,440
We'll add this to his data.
281
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,610
Those Sound Shinobis
are brutal in their own way.
282
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,720
I won't lose to any of you,
you say?
283
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,420
You said it…!
284
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,760
That idiot…
285
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,130
In no time at all, he's made enemies
of his surroundings.
286
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,830
What're you talking big for?! You!
287
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,700
But, I just said what was true, I say!
288
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
E-Everyone, that was a joke.
289
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,740
This guy's quite an idiot, you see…
290
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,610
After all, he says idiotic, spazzy,
scatterbrained things
291
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,450
and gets carried away,
292
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,820
so please don't concern
yourself with him.
293
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,450
Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!
294
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,220
I'm going to kick your butt!
295
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,660
Shall we do it?
296
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,120
Let's do it.
297
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,450
Learn how to read atmosphere
already, you!
298
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,820
Fine!
299
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
These guys…are the Sound Village…
300
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,400
He dodged it!
301
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,440
I can see through that speed.
302
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,790
I see… It's that kind of attack, eh?
303
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,790
What's going on?
304
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,190
He was supposed to have evaded it.
305
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,600
Why'd that happen to his glasses?
306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,060
Probably grazed the tip of his nose.
307
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,670
He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.
308
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,440
Huh?!
309
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,880
Oh! He puked?!
310
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,520
K-Kabuto?
311
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,780
Huh?!
312
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,660
Hah!
313
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,470
Hey, Kabuto!
314
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,470
Are you okay?!
315
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,440
Yeah…I'm okay.
316
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,670
Really?
317
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,240
Oh, so he's not so special.
318
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,240
Even though he's a veteran who's
been taking the exams for four whole years.
319
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,750
Write this on your card.
320
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,550
The three from Sound village…
Doubtless Chunin.
321
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,820
Kabuto should've totally read the attack…
322
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,590
But why did he vomit?
323
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,400
Lee. How about that technique just now?
324
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,640
I had no problem reading the speed.
325
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,700
There's some kind of trick...
326
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,910
Silence! Degenerates!
327
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,660
Sorry to keep you waiting…I
328
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:29,400
I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the
first test of the Chunin Exam.
329
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,400
It feels like the chance to show off
the fruits of our training has finally come.
330
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,740
Well, no matter what kind
of test it is,
331
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,500
it's gonna be a snap!
332
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,010
I'm picturing Sasuke and them
bowing to me and saying,
333
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,610
"Naruto, we're really no match for you."
334
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,610
Huh? Is this for real?!
335
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,620
Next episode: "Start Your Engines:
The Chunin Exam Begins!"
336
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,450
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,690
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,630
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,900
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,310
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,980
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,710
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,580
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,460
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,730
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,600
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,370
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,340
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,810
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,380
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,890
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,590
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,600
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,590
Hey, you there.
21
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,050
Identify yourself.
22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,290
I'm not obliged to answer…
23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,760
What…?!
24
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,460
Cute…
25
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,600
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats…
26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,810
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.
27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,110
Yeah...
28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,580
It appears this year's
test-takers will be amusing.
29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,910
For us proctors too, eh…
30
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,590
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,420
Don't pull.
32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,660
Sasuke… Sasuke Uchiha, eh.
33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,570
Does that kid concern you?
34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,970
Hmph…
35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,650
Lee, let's go.
36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,280
What're you doing?
37
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,120
You guys go on ahead.
I have something I want to check out.
38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,920
What's that about?
39
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,390
Why should I know?
40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
You, with the unpleasant look.
Wait a minute!
41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,770
Huh?
42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,510
– Oh! 					– Yikes!
43
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,680
What is it?
44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,780
Why don't you fight with me
here now?
45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,090
Chunin Challenge:
Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!
46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,860
A fight here now…?
47
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,490
Yes.
48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
My name's Rock Lee.
49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,010
When asking a person their name,
50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,370
I'm supposed to give
my own name first, right?
51
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,240
Sasuke Uchiha…
52
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,180
Hmph… So you knew?
53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,420
I want to fight with you!
54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,590
I want to test out how effective
my techniques will be
55
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,790
against the descendant of the
clan reputed for genius Ninjas.
56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,590
Also…
57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,300
Sakura. Love.
58
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,570
Noooo!
Those lower eyelashes are awful!
59
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,540
The hairstyle is awful, too!
60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Those bushy eyebrows,
just too intense!
61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,710
Everything is...!
62
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,280
You're an angel!
63
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,020
Noooooo!
64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,590
You are good at it.
Then, how about...?
65
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,580
Really... That was super close.
66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,020
You! Don't throw strange stuff!
67
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,580
I was dodging for my life!
68
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,050
You don't have to resent me that much.
69
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,490
It's Sasuke again!
Darn it! Darn it!
70
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,600
To be honest, you're a naive one,
71
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,170
knowing the name of Uchiha
and challenging me.
72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,570
Do you want to realize
what this name is , Bushy-Brow?
73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,570
I insist.
74
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,540
I'm lucky...
75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,350
to be able to have a bout with
the number one rookie right away.
76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,280
And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!
77
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,220
Wait!
78
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,530
I AM going to take out
the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
79
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,330
Hey, you…!
80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,470
Big deal.
81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I'll be able to take care of him
in just five minutes!
82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,810
The one I want to fight isn't you…
lt's Uchiha.
83
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,610
All these people…
84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,580
keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke.
How annoying!
85
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,260
Darn it!
86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,530
Leaf Whirlwind!
87
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,010
As I thought, he's strong…
88
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,580
I declare. You are absolutely
no match for me.
89
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Because…
90
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,990
among the Leaf Village Genin,
I'm the strongest now.
91
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,500
He stopped my kick…
92
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,170
What's with that Chakra in his arm…?
93
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,670
Interesting. I'll do it.
94
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh…
95
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,250
Stop! Sasuke!
96
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,250
There's less than thirty minutes
until the 3:00 registration.
97
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,620
Don't worry.
98
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,920
It'll be over in five minutes.
99
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,990
Here he comes!
100
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,590
I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.
101
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,400
I may end up breaking the taboo.
102
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,830
I may end up using…
that technique!
103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,140
Leaf Hurricanes!
104
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,580
I can't get completely out
of the way…
105
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,410
Guard!
106
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,150
What…?!
107
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,280
Sasuke!
108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,490
W-What's going on?
109
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,130
But…he did guard himself
just now, no mistake.
110
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
He got around my guard.
111
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,970
What is it?
112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,670
Is it Ninjutsu…?
Or is it Genjutsu…?!
113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,910
As I thought, he's going to get up!
114
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,580
Hmph… That's okay.
115
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,580
If that's the case,
116
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,850
this is a good opportunity
to get used to THAT.
117
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,950
I'll do it.
118
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,590
Huh?! C-Could that be…?
119
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,400
Sharingan!
120
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,000
Sasuke, when has he...
Why is that in his eyes…
121
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,370
And in both eyes…!
122
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,310
Is that the Sharingan?
123
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,450
Sasuke's awesome, after all!
124
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,750
If this is the same Kekkei Genkai
as Kakashi Sensei's…
125
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,290
he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!
126
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,730
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…
127
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,800
It's some kind of magic either way…
I'll reveal that!
128
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,540
It feels like Sasuke's rapidly
getting stronger.
129
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,640
That's to be expected
of the Uchiha clan.
130
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,210
That's right…
Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.
131
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,750
Huh?!
132
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,560
The Sharingan…!
133
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,790
To not be able to discern the Jutsu
with the Sharingan…
134
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,590
Could it be…that his technique is…!
135
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,930
That's right…
136
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,900
My technique is neither
Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu.
137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,570
S-Sasuke!
138
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,410
That's right!
139
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,590
My technique is
mere Taijutsu…Sasuke.
140
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,590
You may not be able to
believe it just like that, but…
141
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,590
Punk!
142
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,500
It's said that the Sharingan has
the ability to spot
143
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,570
all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.
144
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,140
Make no mistake,
145
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,940
the Sharingan reads Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu that
146
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,010
require the principle of building up
Chakra and weaving Signs,
147
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,210
and can most surely handle such Jutsu.
148
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,580
However, only Taijutsu is
a little bit different…
149
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,680
W-What do you mean?!
150
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,120
Even if you can spot my movements
with the Sharingan,
151
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,590
your body is not equipped with
the speed to respond to my Taijutsu.
152
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,130
In other words, even if you understand
with your eyes,
153
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,170
there's nothing you can do if your
body can't keep up.
154
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,300
Do you know?
155
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,540
There are two types of strong people,
genius-types and effort-types.
156
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,680
If your Sharingan is
a genius-type drawing Uchiha ability…
157
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,550
I'm an effort-type who has
patiently mastered only Taijutsu.
158
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,190
In a manner of speaking,
159
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,690
your Sharingan and my ultimate
Taijutsu have the worst compatibility…
160
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,290
Guard!
161
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,670
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow…!
162
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,610
And I shall prove it with this technique.
163
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,380
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
164
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
W-What's he going to do…?!
165
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,020
It's my victory!
166
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,030
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!
167
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,000
And I shall prove it with this technique.
168
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,970
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
169
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,240
W-What's he going to do…?!
170
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,570
It's my victory!
171
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,010
Huh?!
172
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,580
– Huh? 					– Huh?!
173
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,720
That's…!
174
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,590
That's as far as it goes! Lee!
175
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,730
W-What is it…?
What's going on?
176
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,530
Sasuke!
177
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,010
Sasuke was beaten?!
178
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,580
What happened while
I was knocked out?!
179
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,180
Are you okay?! Sasuke.
180
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,590
He's agitated…
To think he couldn't fall properly.
181
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,860
Y-You were watching…?
182
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,530
Lee! That technique just now
is prohibited, you know!
183
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,170
W-What's with that turtle…?
184
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,570
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to…
185
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,310
He's…getting scolded or something…
186
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,580
Could that be…Bushy-Brow's teacher?!
187
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,590
B-But, of course,
188
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,630
I didn't even remotely have
a mind to use the Hidden technique…
189
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,590
There's no mistake!
190
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,960
– Huh? 					– Huh?
191
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,830
Hey-hey.
192
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,330
What…?
193
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,470
That thing… It's a turtle, right…?
Right?
194
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,340
Isn't it obvious?!
195
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,340
Say! Say! Can even a turtle
become a Ninja teacher?
196
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,240
I don't know!
197
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,580
Fool!
198
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,650
You think such subterfuge will work?!
199
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,590
You should know very well what
it means
200
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,590
for a Shinobi to give away
his technique!
201
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,590
I…I know.
202
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,630
To think I lost to someone so flippant…
203
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,570
Have you prepared yourself?
204
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,110
Y-Yes sir…
205
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,580
All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!
206
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,680
Man! Life treating you good, huh?
207
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Huh?!
208
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,230
Whoaaa! An even more
intense guy has appeared!
209
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Yo, Lee!
210
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,030
Super intense.
The extreme bowl cut...
211
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,000
T-Those are some incredibly
raging brows…
212
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,800
I've never seen anything like that
in my life.
213
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,580
H-Hey! You guys!
Don't mock Guy Sensei!
214
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,680
Shut up!
215
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,580
I'm at a loss for a reaction because
216
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,450
of those bizarre things appearing
one after another!
217
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,580
What?!
218
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,180
Hey, Lee! Drop it!
219
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,390
Yes, sir…
220
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,630
Idiot!
221
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,810
Lee, you…you…
222
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,810
S-Sensei…!
223
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,080
L-Lee…
224
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,680
Sensei…I…I…
225
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,590
Enough, Lee!
Don't say anything!
226
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,360
Sensei!
227
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,590
Lee!
228
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,600
I lost to a guy like that…
229
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,640
Yes…this is adolescence!
230
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,470
Sensei!
231
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,740
That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.
232
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,750
I-Idiot! That's dangerous!
Very dangerous!
233
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,020
It's okay, Lee!
234
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,720
Mistakes come with adolescence.
Don't worry about it!
235
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,790
You're so kind…Sensei!
236
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,630
Now then, take a hundred laps around
the Training Field toward that setting sun!
237
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,500
Yes! Sensei!
238
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,180
Let's go!
239
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,080
Yes, sir!
240
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,350
Hey, wait a minute.
241
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,580
We're still in the middle
of the conversation!
242
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,590
What're you going to do
about the Chunin Exam?!
243
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,460
There's no time!
244
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,990
Huh? Oh, that's right…
245
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,530
Lee, you will be punished for attempting
to break the prohibition on top of fighting…
246
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,370
in principle, after
the Chunin Exam.
247
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,340
Okay!
248
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,370
Five hundred howls of adolescence!
249
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,310
Yes, sir!
250
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,750
Idiots…
251
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,550
Say! Say!
252
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,920
By the way, what's with that turtle?
253
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,590
If I'm not mistaken, those kids are…
254
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,950
Kakashi's…
255
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,720
Oh! No, he's looking this way!
256
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,600
You guys…how's Kakashi Sensei?
257
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,460
You know Kakashi…?
258
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,430
I know him all too well.
259
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,710
People call us…
eternal rivals.
260
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,880
Sounds like a lie!
261
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,680
What're you saying?!
Guy Sensei really is…
262
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,980
That's fine.
263
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,250
"Action speaks louder than words"
anyway.
264
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,120
Huh?!
265
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,790
By the way, my record is fifty wins
and forty-nine losses.
266
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,590
Huh?!
267
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,960
This guy…
268
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,500
When did he...?
269
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,000
One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi…
270
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,840
N-No way…
271
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,910
He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi!
ls he human…?!
272
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,580
How about that?!
Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!
273
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,080
Darn it…
274
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,590
This time around,
Lee caused the trouble.
275
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,250
Out of consideration for my face,
forgive him.
276
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,590
Out of consideration for
this pleasant face.
277
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,930
He's better than that Kakashi…?
278
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,600
Darn it! He's…
279
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,900
not just all talk…
280
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,140
You guys and Lee should probably go
to the classroom pretty soon.
281
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,180
He...!
282
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,590
Then, do your best, Lee!
Farewell!
283
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,590
Yes, sir.
284
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,590
What?!
285
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,590
Sasuke…
286
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,900
I have one last thing to tell you.
287
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,570
I actually came here to
verify my own ability.
288
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
I lied before.
289
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,080
The strongest man of the
Leaf Village Genin might be on my team.
290
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,590
I'm entering in order
to defeat that person.
291
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,120
And, you are one of my targets.
292
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
Please prepare yourself for the Exam!
293
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,570
Sasuke…
294
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,110
Ha! So…
295
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,580
I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?
296
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,020
Naruto!
297
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,580
Shut up!
298
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,890
I'll knock him flat next time!
299
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,590
Ha! That from someone
who just got whipped.
300
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,860
Hey…what's your problem?!
Naruto, you!
301
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,570
You saw it, didn't you? His hand…
302
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,580
That Bushy-Brow probably did a heck
of a lot of special training.
303
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,340
Day after day…
304
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,580
More than you have…
305
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,450
That's all it is.
306
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,590
Sasuke…
307
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,970
Interesting…
308
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,570
Hmph!
309
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,180
It's starting to get interesting…
the Chunin Exam!
310
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,680
What's next?
311
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Yeah!
312
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,220
All right!
313
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,690
Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!
314
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Yeah!
315
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,260
Whoaaaa!
There are tons of people here!
316
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,700
Are they all here to take
the Chunin Exam?
317
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,200
Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba,
Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?
318
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,700
So you're all here, too?
319
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,540
Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!
320
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,540
Open up your eyes and watch me
become the Hokage!
321
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,580
Next episode:
"Genin Takedown!
All Nine Rookies Face Off!"
322
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,590
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,060
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,120
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,310
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,480
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,820
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,250
I’ve…had it…
20
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,320
Oh, Sakura!
21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,460
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?
22
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,360
The tower hasn’t gotten a bit closer.
23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,800
Here we can see it
right in front of our eyes.
24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,500
Strange…
25
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,170
No mistake about it.
26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,970
It seems that we’re already within
the enthusiastic welcome.
27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,640
Take a look at that.
28
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,140
Huh?
29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,610
Oh, that can’t be!
30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,720
What on earth is going on?!
31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,190
No way!
32
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,590
Is it Genjutsu…?
33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,860
So it seems.
We were lured in perfectly.
34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,460
It appears we were meticulously careful,
35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,470
and were made to walk
around the same place in a circle.
36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,300
We’re being watched…
37
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,840
Probably.
38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,440
They intend to wear down
our physical strength and
39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,540
catch us unprepared when
we’re bone-tired.
40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,540
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
41
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,310
Then.... They’ll be coming soon.
42
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,690
Humph, they’ve appeared.
43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,030
This is the perfect handicap.
Believe it!
44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,400
Clone vs. Clone:
Mine are Better than Yours!
45
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,540
W-What is this?
46
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,270
It’s quite a number.
47
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,640
Moreover, they’re clones?
48
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,650
Cornered rats.
49
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,520
Shut up!
50
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,500
Oh, they’re quite weak, huh?
51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,570
Good!
52
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,770
Naruto!
53
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,020
W-What are these guys?
54
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,570
W-What’s going on here?
55
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,780
I’ll assess this!
56
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,540
Sharingan!
57
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,180
Naruto!
58
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,470
Sasuke!
59
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,310
Sasuke!
60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,420
W-What’s going on?
61
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,720
My body’s…
62
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,260
Are you okay?
63
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,400
No mistake.
64
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,900
It’s the real thing, not an illusion.
65
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:05,610
– Scroll please.
– Scroll please.
66
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,750
That Kabuto was injured means
these things are actual Shadow Clones?!
67
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,650
B-But... even though Shadow clones
are supposed to vanish
68
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,460
if they take a direct attack,
these things don't vanish.
69
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!
70
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,090
Which is it?!
71
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,200
Scroll please.
72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Scroll please.
73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,900
Give me scroll.
74
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,530
Dang it!
75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
It’s futile!
76
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,840
Stop!
77
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,510
These things are illusions.
78
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,540
It’s an enemy Genjutsu.
79
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,420
B-But, Kabuto’s wound is the real thing.
80
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,720
No, it’s as Sasuke says.
81
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,860
Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere…
82
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,560
and coordinating their attack with
movements of the “Genjutsu Shinobis”
83
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,630
and attacking from a different location.
84
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,100
Pretending as if those
Genjutsu Shinobis are attacking.
85
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,540
– Scroll please.
– Scroll please.
86
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,550
Then I’ll find the idiot who’s behind
the scenes
87
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,880
throwing Kunai knives
and kick his butt, believe it!
88
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,250
Hold it, Naruto.
89
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,360
We’ve been deceived as
to the source of the Kunai knives…
90
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,660
so we can’t discover the precise
location of the enemy like this.
91
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,430
Do you get it?
92
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
That is the enemy’s purpose.
93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,370
From a data standpoint, it’s a type
who is weak at close combat
94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,900
and Taijutsu that likes
this kind of attack.
95	02:22:38:03	02:22:42:29
The true enemy won’t come out
until we can’t move at all.
95
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,210
Listen, everyone!
96
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,550
In any case,
97
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,820
all there is to do now is to fend
off the enemy attack.
98
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,720
Fine, if that’s what their plan is…
99
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,990
Now then…
I wonder how far they can hold out.
100
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,730
The night is long.
101
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,890
Man! 					This is endless!
102
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,020
Since it’s come to this…!
103
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,020
Stop!
104
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,060
Naruto, don’t waste your Chakra!
105
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,930
Even if you attack these things,
there’s no point!
106
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,570
If I hit them all in
a single sweep,
107
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,800
the enemy won’t fire inadvertently
while these things are reverting back.
108
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,310
The hiding place will
be discovered, so.
109
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,510
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
110
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,550
Shadow Clones?!
111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,910
It’s not over yet!
112
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,010
Sasuke, what should we do…?
113
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,450
Man, that loser.
All there is to do is go for it!
114
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,450
B-But…
115
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,710
Indeed…
116
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,080
It’s not a situation that
he can get through by himself.
117
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,550
Let’s go, Sakura!
118
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,420
Y-Yeah!
119
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,710
I’m not finished yet…
120
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,560
Dawn is breaking.
121
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,190
It’s finally time for the hunt.
122
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Mubi, that’s enough.
123
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,170
We’re finished hunting their spirits.
124
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,900
Now what’s left is just their bodies.
125
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,940
Lucky.
126
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,550
You’re…the one who…
did my left shoulder.
127
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,550
I finally found you.
128
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
You really hung me up.
129
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,090
Lucky.
130
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,320
I can finally even the score.
131
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,480
You…really hung me up.
132
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,180
Lucky.
133
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,650
I can finally even the score.
134
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,260
Heh!
135
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,000
Cornered rats.
136
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,540
It went well, Naruto!
137
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,620
W-What the heck
are these guys?!
138
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,550
T-This can’t be!
139
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,850
Since when…?!
140
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,420
Idiot!
141
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,560
You finally showed your
true colors, punk!
142
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,970
T-This brat, don’t tell me…
143
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,570
The Shadow Clone is just
the preparation for the trick...
144
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,110
for me to portray every member
of the team by myself!
145
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,980
At the same time Naruto
lifted the Shadow Clone,
146
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,680
the three of us hid.
147
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,020
The Genjutsu users were
adversely deceived.
148
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Naruto!
149
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,570
Naruto, you’ve used too much Chakra.
150
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,670
I’ll do the rest.
151
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,490
No way! I’m not always going to have
the good parts taken away!
152
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,130
Is this really that Naruto…?
153
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,800
Since when had he improved
this much?
154
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,710
That’s some brat…
155
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,780
I can’t believe he can still move.
156
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,510
Naruto…
157
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,050
Amazing Chakra stamina…
158
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,260
Right after
a Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu…
159
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,730
a daring technique that transforms just
three of the bodies into his companions.
160
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,600
To think he can still move
even after doing all that.
161
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,170
Here it’s the fifth day now.
162
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,510
This kid will transform
163
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,110
if he can just master
the use of his Chakra.
164
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,650
Not bad.
165
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,820
But we’re still not unlucky.
166
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,960
There’s no time.
167
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,830
This time around,
we’ll show you our Ninjutsu!
168
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,500
Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!
169
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,340
Shadow clones?
170
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,170
No, they are plain clones.
171
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,880
However, he's up to something.
172
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,210
Be careful!
173
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,180
Hah! If they are just clones,
then there’s one real body.
174
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,720
I’ll kick their butts right
and left until I run into him.
175
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,750
You idiot.
176
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,390
Such a tactless thing…
177
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,920
I’m telling you!
178
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,920
I’m saying don’t stick your nose in!
179
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,260
Naruto!
180
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,300
That’s reckless!
181
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,100
Cripes!
182
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,110
From earlier, the nape of my neck
hurts when I use the Sharingan.
183
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,150
Maybe I used too much Chakra.
184
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,920
Dang it!
185
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,550
Dang it. A clone?!
186
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,190
This one, too?!
187
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,560
This one, too?!
188
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,560
This one, too?!
189
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,590
Naruto! Stop!
190
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,230
Are they all fakes?!
191
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,100
Or could it be Genjutsu again?!
192
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,440
This is… the last…Chakra.
193
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,670
Sharingan!
194
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,550
Sasuke!
195
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,090
The bruise again…
196
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,190
Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!
197
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,430
It won’t do to create an opening!
198
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,840
Kabuto!
199
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,180
Darn it!
200
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,550
Stop! Naruto!
201
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,090
No matter how much
you swing at them,
202
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,890
the real body isn’t in those clones.
203
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,460
Then where’s the enemy
attacking us from?!
204
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,070
If they are merely clones,
the clones themselves can’t attack!
205
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,570
If I knew that, we wouldn’t be
having a rough time of it!
206
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,540
This is the enemy’s scheme.
207
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,580
Man, I can’t use
the Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore…
208
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,550
They’ve about reached their limit.
209
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,250
Lucky.
210
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,690
That’s it!
211
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,860
The real body hides with
the Earth Style Jutsu
212
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,700
and attacks from behind a clone!
213
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Kabuto!
214
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,140
Heh, “it won’t do to
create an opening,” right?!
215
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,550
Thank you, Naruto.
You saved me.
216
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,180
We're okay here, Naruto!
217
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,430
What happened there?  Are you hurt?
218
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,170
That’s a terrible bruise.
219
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,540
It’s nothing.
220
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,110
Here it is, here it is!
221
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,680
Look, the Heaven scroll!
222
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,010
Good for you.
223
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,550
There’s something about this guy...
that I don’t like.
224
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,370
Oh, it’s you guys.
225
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,540
You’re late, Kabuto.
226
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,000
I got a bit involved in something.
227
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,540
Sorry.
228
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,540
But, but…
thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.
229
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,710
No, it’s because you guys fought hard.
230
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,420
You were amazing
at the end, Naruto.
231
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,690
We’re going through this door.
232
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,930
Well then, I wish us both luck.
233
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,100
Yeah!
234
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,230
Yeah!
235
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,780
What of the harvest?
236
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,010
Yes.
237
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,550
More than I expected.
238
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,680
I filled in his entire data
from this second exam.
239
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,190
You need this, right?
240
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,090
So, how was it?
241
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,530
Sure enough, it appears you’re curious.
242
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,200
Master Orochimaru.
243
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,300
I want to ask your opinion.
244
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,330
As a Sound Village’s spy…
245
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,640
That’s not necessary, is it?
246
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,540
You will be the one to decide it all, so…
247
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,180
I like that cleverness of yours.
248
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,320
Good work.
249
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,690
There’s nobody here.
250
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,090
I’m okay now, Sakura.
251
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,630
O-Okay.
252
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,460
That’s too bad!
253
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,230
Cha!
254
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,970
Say-say, what’re we supposed to do?
255
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,970
Oh! Look at that…
256
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,640
Without… Heaven…
I don’t get it at all.
257
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,840
If “Heaven” does not exist,
258
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,510
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.
259
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,550
If “Earth” does not exist,
260
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,480
run the fields in search
of an advantage.
261
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,550
Open the series of
Heaven and Earth,
262
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,490
and the perilous way
shall be redressed…
263
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,160
This is namely the secret of
“the one that guides…”
264
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,960
What’s that?
265
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,930
It looks like there are letters
or something missing there.
266
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,600
It’s probably has to do with the scroll.
267
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,670
I think this means we’re supposed
to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
268
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,260
Okay then, I’m going to open it.
269
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,770
Hey, can you hear it?
270
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:40,010
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
271
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:49,550
The ocean spans limitlessly
272
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:57,890
Please keep that smile on your face forever
273
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,900
Or else I’ll cry
274
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,670
You won't have to search around you
275
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,480
It’s all ok now.
276
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:21,320
Everyone is inside
this hand
277
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,660
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away
278
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,230
When you forget what happiness is
279
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,000
Just sing.
280
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,500
Light is born, and darkness was born
281
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,610
The two are one
282
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:49,050
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
283
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,550
Hey, can you hear it?
284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,320
What’s this, what’s this?
285
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,760
Here I thought that the really
strong ones were remaining,
286
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,560
but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru,
all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.
287
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,570
And that Lee’s team, too.
288
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,140
So much for getting all inflated.
289
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,140
Well, I’m the man who’s going
to become the Hokage.
290
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,140
I must impress them and
291
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,810
show that I’m not in the same class
as any ordinary blockhead!
292
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,550
Next episode: "Surviving the Cut!
The Rookie Nine Together Again!
//%
1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,450
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,250
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,370
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,660
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,200
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,830
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,450
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,870
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,490
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,490
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,080
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,490
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,540
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:19,490
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,660
Milady, the skies have
begun to look threatening.
16
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,660
We should seek lodging for the night
before we get rained on.
17
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,490
I see. Carry on.
18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, Milady.
19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,200
What dense fog?!
20
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,490
We cannot see what’s up ahead.
21
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,540
What was that?
22
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,490
Is something the matter?
23
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,290
Lady Kayo!
24
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,490
The Mysterious Curse
of the Haunted House
25
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,950
I hear that it happened while the mistress
of the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo,
26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,490
was on her way to visit the household
of her parents in Land of Candy.
27
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,660
Attendants from Land of Candy
went out to meet them,
28
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,000
thinking it odd
that their arrival was delayed,
29
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,490
only to find that the palanquin and poles
had been cast away at the mountain pass.
30
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,580
I am told that Lady Kayo and
all of her attendants have disappeared.
31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,490
Then, our task is to search
for the Lady, right?
32
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,790
That is so.
33
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,620
Hinata’s Byakugan and Kiba
and Akamaru’s keen sense of smell
34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,620
should prove helpful
in this search mission,
35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,490
and Naruto is, well, just Naruto.
36
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,370
What are you saying, Grandma?
37
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,750
That I have nothing in particular
to recommend me?
38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,370
But isn’t that the case?
39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,790
I think that you have
good points, too, Naruto…
40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,950
Oh! Leave it to Hinata.
41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,790
Go ahead and list them up
for Grandma Tsunade!
42
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,370
Come on,
what are my good points?
43
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,000
Er…umm… 					Let me see…
44
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,660
It shouldn’t be that hard!
45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,540
I didn’t mean to make it
seem that way… Um…well…
46
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,490
Hey there, you two.
Are you done?
47
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,200
Say, Grandma, there wouldn’t be
anything odd
48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,490
happening in this mission, would there?
49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,490
Something odd?
50
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,490
That is to say…might there perhaps…
be ghosts involved?
51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,490
Ghosts?
Are you afraid of such things?
52
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,750
Well, umm, er…kinda.
53
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,490
There are no such things as ghosts.
54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,500
Stop talking such nonsense
and get on your way.
55
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,660
Which brings us to the question
of where to, Fifth Hokage?
56
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,620
Kubisaki Pass.
57
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,370
K-Kubisaki Pass?
As in the Broken Neck Pass?
58
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,660
I knew I had a bad premonition.
59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Fool!
60
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,000
A Shinobi shouldn't dally about such
things. Get to business!
61
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,490
You’re scarier than any ghost!
62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,580
We’re off!
63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,490
Excuse us.
64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,490
It’s always like this with that one…
65
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,330
Lady Tsunade,
Kubisaki Pass is where
66
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,000
the capital of
the Land of Necks once stood isn't it?
67
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,490
The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan,
68
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,580
which met its destruction 50 years ago,
must still be there.
69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,490
And what of it?
70
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,120
Ruined castles may be found
just about anywhere.
71
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,580
Have you caught
Naruto’s cowardice bug, Shizune?
72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,490
N-No, that’s not it.
73
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,200
Oh, this is the spot.
74
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,370
The Broken Neck Pass.
75
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,290
It gives me the creeps
somehow, I tell you.
76
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,490
It's started to rain. Let’s hurry.
77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,580
It’s really coming down!
78
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,290
A castle.
79
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,620
I hadn’t heard anything
about a castle standing here.
80
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,250
Somehow,
I have a bad feeling about this.
81
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,540
See, see?! This mission is starting
to seem creepier and creepier.
82
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,490
But this may be a major clue.
83
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,950
Let’s go.
84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,750
Yeah. At this rate,
we’ll get soaking wet.
85
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,250
H-Hey, don’t be in such a hurry!
86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,490
What a magnificent castle.
87
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,540
Won’t it be sort of rude
to suddenly intrude upon them?
88
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,750
It’s almost night.
Maybe we’ll be causing them trouble.
89
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,540
Naruto, don’t tell me
you really are scared!
90
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,910
N-No way, I tell you!
91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,490
Pull yourself together, Naruto.
92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Let’s go.
93
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,620
The door opened by itself!
94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
Excuse me, is anybody home?
95
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,540
The lights are turned on.
96
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,080
Please let us shelter here
from the rain for a bit!
97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,950
Hey! Wait! Akamaru!
98
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,080
Excuse us!
99
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,490
Good evening.
100
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,490
Something sure smells good.
101
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,750
It’s still warm.
102
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,660
Was someone here
until just a little while ago?
103
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,330
What’s that?
104
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,290
That’s one scary looking guy.
105
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,500
I wonder if he’s the master of this castle.
106
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,620
If he’s the master of this castle,
than that makes him a feudal lord right?
107
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,750
If this is the feudal lord’s castle,
108
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,490
then the area around here
should be the capital.
109
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,080
But this is right on the country borderline.
110
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,490
Hey! Akamaru!
111
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,490
What are you doing?
112
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,580
You shouldn’t eat that
without permission.
113
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,200
– Naruto? 					– What is it?
114
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,450
Don’t startle me like that.
115
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,000
Just now, the painting’s eyes moved!
116
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,790
You moron. How could a painting move?
You’re too much of a scaredy-cat.
117
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,500
The table’s set for seven people.
118
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,490
So, what of it?
119
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,500
The Land of Honey party that
went missing also numbered seven.
120
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,700
The Lady and her attendants
may still be in this castle…
121
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,410
Let’s split up and search for them.
122
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,250
Wha…? 					We gonna split up?
123
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,040
Since we’re all here together,
why don’t we search together?
124
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,450
What do you say, Kiba? Hinata?
125
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,490
Naruto, stop talking like a kid.
This is a mission!
126
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,790
You don’t have to scold me so much!
I know that!
127
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,330
Hey! Wait a minute!
128
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,660
I’m just not cut out for this kind of stuff.
129
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,870
This is scarier than going to the bathroom
in the middle of the night!
130
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,750
This is creepy!
131
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,490
No!
132
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,490
Not again!
133
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,490
Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru!
134
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,490
I’m too scared alone, after all!
135
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,080
Do you sense it, too? I’m sure this is
the scent of a human being.
136
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,370
It’s here.
137
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,490
There’s no one here.
138
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,870
I’ll eat you up.
139
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,490
Who’s that?
ls someone there?
140
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
The ceiling…
141
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,910
Take that, you.
142
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,160
Look at all these books!
143
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,910
The History of Neck Castle…
144
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,040
This was written a full fifty years ago!
145
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,490
"The enemy forces
have already surrounded the castle.
146
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,120
"Our people were brutally
slaughtered and
147
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,490
"there’re only few of the soldiers
left in castle.
148
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,290
"It seems certain that
I would not live to see nightfall either.
149
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,120
"But my thirst for vengeance
remains in the castle,
150
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,000
"and I vow with this castle
to consume every last man,
151
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,290
"every human setting foot
within these walls…
152
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,490
"Signed, Gosa Kubisaki."
153
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,370
Consume?
154
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,000
I’ll eat you…
155
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,370
What is this?
156
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,500
Gosa Kubisaki!
157
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,620
Crap!
158
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,540
Hinata! Hey!
159
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,790
Hinata! Pull yourself together!
160
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,000
Naruto…
161
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Naruto, Hinata, are you all right?
162
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,250
Kiba, Akamaru!
163
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,490
A castle that fell fifty years ago?
164
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,290
What nonsense!
165
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,000
That is how the scroll is dated.
166
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,750
It says that everyone who enters this castle
will be eaten alive.
167
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,040
True, we have been swallowed whole!
168
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,620
Naruto!
169
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,200
Are you okay? Hey!
170
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,290
That hurt!
171
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,450
There he is!
172
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,490
I-I’m sorry!
173
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,490
What is this?
174
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,660
This isn’t the armor of the Kubisaki Clan.
175
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,870
I wonder if this belonged
to an enemy soldier…
176
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,540
There’s some more over there.
They are different armors.
177
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,450
Those armors bear
the crest of the Kubisaki Clan.
178
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,830
Let’s hurry up and get out of here!
179
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,450
That’s the same armor as in the painting!
180
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,490
Could it be…
that this is the real Gosa Kubisaki?
181
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,410
Gosa Kubisaki?
182
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,080
What’s going on?
183
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,620
He’s melting!
184
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,700
What is this?
185
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,410
Something smells really sour.
186
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,250
There is something
strange about this castle.
187
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,250
Hinata!
188
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,660
Yeah.
189
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,950
Byakugan!
190
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,700
The whole wall is covered
with a flow of Chakra.
191
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,950
Why?
192
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,490
It’s moving!
193
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,410
This wall seems to be alive!
194
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,370
What if…
195
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,040
Gentle Fist!
196
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,830
A-Are you all right, Hinata?
197
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,950
Uh-huh.
198
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,620
I’ve seen something very similar to this
somewhere before.
199
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,330
The giant toad summoned
by the Pervy Sage…
200
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,250
from inside its stomach!
201
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,490
Inside its stomach?!
202
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,830
Then, I wonder if, by chance,
this smell could be…gastric juices?!
203
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,660
Gosa Kubisaki invoked
the Summoning Jutsu
204
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,490
before the fall of the castle.
205
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,250
But the thing he summoned…
206
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,080
was big enough
to swallow the entire castle whole.
207
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,750
From the time we entered the castle,
we, too, have been gobbled up!
208
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,540
But, why would this thing go to the trouble
of transforming to a castle to eat us?
209
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,750
I don’t know.
210
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,830
What was that?
211
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:40,950
Oh!
212
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,490
H-Help!
213
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,540
Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey?
214
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,540
She’s embedded in the wall.
215
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,250
We are from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
216
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,490
We have come to help you.
217
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,750
Here, I’ll help you out now.
218
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,910
It’s no use.
219
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,660
Please hang on!
220
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,330
Oh no! This thing is rounding up
all the humans inside here
221
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,490
and returning to its original form.
222
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,450
At this rate, we're in danger too!
223
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,490
Naruto, Hinata,
we’ve got to get out of here!
224
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,490
Man Beast Clone!
225
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,370
Fang over Fang!
226
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,700
I am the castle.
227
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,160
and by order of my master Gosa,
I am to eat all who set foot within.
228
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,660
Naruto!
229
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,200
Ouch…
230
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,870
I’ll eat you.
231
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,580
How can we get out of its stomach?!
232
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,250
I don’t know.
233
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,450
If this creature was Summoned,
234
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,490
then there should be
a scroll for the contract.
235
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,000
If we tear up the scroll, then this creature
should return to the world it came from.
236
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,790
Is that so?
237
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,500
– Hinata! 					– Right!
238
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,580
Byakugan!
239
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,490
Found it.
240
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,660
It’s up above.
Probably in the castle tower.
241
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,160
How are we supposed to
get up there in this situation?!
242
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,330
The wall’s Chakra have
begun to stabilize again.
243
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,000
Who's that?
244
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,950
Gosa Kubisaki!
245
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,490
I won’t be fooled again.
246
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,080
That, too, is just a phantom
created by the Summoning.
247
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,160
Wait!
248
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,370
He looks different from the one before.
249
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,540
Wh-What’s he doing?
250
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,750
He seems to want us to follow him.
251
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,200
Huh? He disappeared!
252
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,950
Naruto, over there.
253
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,700
Oh, it’s the scroll!
254
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,040
It's starting to act up again.
Hurry, Naruto!
255
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:08,700
Right!
256
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,160
This is…
257
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,410
It’s the true form
of the Summoned animal.
258
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,660
The concentration of acid is increasing.
259
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,490
Hey, let’s hurry and wind things up!
260
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,910
Wait a minute.
261
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,540
What if, when this summoned animal
goes back to where it came from,
262
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,490
it takes us with it, too?
263
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,490
We’ll just have to take our chances.
We gotta do this!
264
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,830
Right.
265
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,700
Did that do it?
266
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,490
What the--?!
267
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,410
Naruto!
268
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,370
Naruto!
269
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,540
Over there, Naruto.
270
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,500
It should be possible
to tear the wall at that spot.
271
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,580
Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
272
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,540
Rasengan!
273
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,120
Naruto!
274
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,160
The lord of this castle must have died
275
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,370
resenting the people
who seized the castle from him.
276
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,580
But, he also led us
to where the scroll was hidden…
277
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,490
Then, does that mean that
he decided to let go of his grudge?
278
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,000
Surely that must be the case.
279
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
What’s more, he must have felt sorry for
280
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,540
the Summoned animal that
nobly served him for fifty years,
281
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,620
and wanted to release it.
282
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,790
I see.
283
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,540
Then maybe he was waiting
for someone
284
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,200
to release the Summoned animal
from its spell.
285
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,660
And now, it has finally been able to
return to its own world.
286
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,660
On a checkerboard night
287
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,290
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
288
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,660
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
289
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,830
Suggestively
290
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,580
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
291
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,410
The Trombone gradually going off-key
292
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,870
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
293
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,910
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
294
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,120
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
295
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,910
How did it go, Bushy Brow?
296
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,790
Hush. He doesn’t look himself.
297
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,500
He sure looks gloomy.
298
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,490
The results were bad.
I'd say considerably.
299
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,790
Huh? "Considerably"?
300
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,200
It can’t be helped.
lt must have been considerable.
301
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,200
Then…could it be that Bushy Brow is…?
302
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,490
Yes… I’m sorry but…
303
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,490
Then he's considerably…
considerably…?!
304
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,950
Next time: “The Third Super-Beast!”
//%
1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,550
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,350
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,470
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,760
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,300
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,930
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,550
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,970
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,590
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,590
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,180
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,590
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,640
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,930
♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
16
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,590
Because I had a sad dream last night.
17
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,100
My eyes are red, from the tears I shed ♪
18
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,430
Swollen as I cried…
19
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,100
Hey!
20
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,140
Neji! Naruto!
21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,550
What happened to those guys?
22
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,680
It seems they were attacked
by the Shinobi in question…
23
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,390
So he appeared again?
24
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,510
He took…he took Sumaru away.
25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,510
What? He took Sumaru?!
26
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,590
Yeah!
27
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,470
Anyway, helping the guys who are
down comes first!
28
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,260
We’ll split up and carry them!
29
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,720
Got it…
30
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,930
Roger!
31
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,600
Mizura…
32
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,100
Naruto!
33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,050
They were attacked by
the Shinobi in the mask!
34
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,970
There are no external injuries…
They’re just unconscious.
35
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,590
Umm… What about the others?
36
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
Lee and Tenten are carrying them
here now.
37
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,350
I see…
38
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,550
Then Sumaru as well…?
39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,050
Oh… Uh…
40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,590
He was taken away by
the masked Shinobi.
41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
I’m sorry…
42
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,590
He escaped into the Valley of Death…
43
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,260
We couldn’t go after him.
44
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,010
The Valley of Death?!
45
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,890
Did he inhale the gas from
the Valley of Death?
46
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,140
No… I put him into a state of
suspended animation beforehand,
47
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,050
so there was no effect on his body.
48
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,850
I understand using Sumaru
to lure that person…
49
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,590
But to use a child from our same village…
50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,550
Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease?
51
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,800
We’re comrades who have
already dirtied our hands…
52
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,850
What’re you doing talking nice now?!
53
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,010
We’ll make those Hidden Leaf kids
believe that
54
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,140
Sumaru’s kidnapping was
the work of that person…
55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,550
After we’ve taken back the star,
we can leave the clean-up to them…
56
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,590
Hidden Jutsu:
The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
57
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,600
Mizura isn’t feeling well and
is taking a break from his training…
58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,350
Byakugan!
59
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,140
What’s this…?!
60
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,100
Mizura!
61
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,010
You okay?
62
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,850
You still need to rest…
63
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,590
I must not rest at a time like this…
64
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,760
I understand how you feel…
65
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,100
But you shouldn’t push yourself too hard!
66
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,590
I’m fine… I can walk by myself…
67
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,180
Mizura! See, didn’t I tell you?!
68
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,390
I’m okay by myself!
69
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,600
Mother… Father!
70
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,430
Mother! Father!
71
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,430
Do not cry… Sumaru…
72
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,510
Your parents protected the star
and protected the village admirably.
73
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,350
Sumaru… Look up at the sky and watch.
74
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,430
There is a treasure you can see only
in the Village Hidden in the Stars.
75
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,590
If you were born as a Shinobi,
76
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,470
for the sake of protecting this village,
for the sake of protecting the star,
77
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,600
become strong!
78
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,050
Like your father and your mother… Okay?
79
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,600
Lord…Hoshikage…
80
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,720
Yeah, this looks good!
81
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,970
Naruto…
82
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,590
Huh?
83
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,970
At this rate, Mizura will die!
84
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,590
I felt a Chakra disturbance
and looked into it.
85
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Despite him lying quietly,
86
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,590
his Chakra was being activated
to the utmost limit.
87
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,720
If that keeps up, he’ll be killed
by his own Chakra.
88
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,470
That could never be…!
89
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,890
There’s no mistake…
90
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,010
But…!
91
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,220
It’s because of the star training.
92
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,470
The star has the power
to activate Chakra.
93
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,300
However, many Shinobi are unable
to control the amplification,
94
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,720
their bodies break down
and it leads to death.
95
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,220
In the middle of this training,
Mizura also…
96
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,140
The Third Hoshikage terminated
training utilizing the star
97
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,680
due to the large amount of casualties.
98
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,590
Then why again?
99
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,590
Lord Akahoshi,
the current leader of the village,
100
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,350
decided to resume the training
half a year ago.
101
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,680
Something so dangerous!
102
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,590
We’ll make him stop right now!
103
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,590
Those born and raised in this village
do not fear the star training!
104
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,390
Why would you…?
105
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,390
If they can complete the training
by themselves
106
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,890
and make every effort possible for
the village as a Hidden Star Shinobi…
107
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,260
Even if the body were to be destroyed,
they would be satisfied.
108
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,100
That’s just…
109
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,970
Go!
110
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,720
Notice my Chakra… Natsuhi!
111
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,100
Hotarubi… Please protect the star,
protect Sumaru…
112
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,180
Akahoshi’s Chakra…
113
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,430
Please use this until you get better…
I’m sure you will!
114
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,720
Thanks, Naruto…
115
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,180
But I won’t…
116
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,640
It seems his condition has stabilized…
117
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,590
Everyone seems okay for the time being.
118
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,760
It still doesn’t sit right with me…
119
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,140
Mizura and Hokuto, they’re all thinking
earnestly of the village.
120
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,550
Especially that Sumaru guy.
121
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,470
He thinks of the village
more than anyone.
122
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,550
What do you mean…?
123
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,930
If it were for the sake
of protecting the village
124
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,590
and the special comrades around me…
125
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,470
I would’ve gotten impatient,
wanting to get strong quickly as well.
126
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Yeah… That’s right…
127
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,350
Yes…
128
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,430
Well, this isn’t the time to
be saying stuff like that.
129
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,590
The unforgivable one is that star thief!
130
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,720
But, there wouldn’t be any suffering
from training if they didn’t use the star.
131
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,760
I think so, too.
132
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,300
If they have the star, everyone would train
for the sake of the village.
133
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,590
But if they do train,
then their bodies get…
134
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,930
Geez, I don’t know what to do!
135
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,140
Our mission is to protect the star.
Our first priority is to get back the star.
136
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
We shouldn’t be meddling in
the matters that follow!
137
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
That’s right…
138
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,100
Okay.
139
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,970
Got it!
140
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,010
Lee and Tenten, you guys search
around the village chief once more!
141
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,430
What? Again?
142
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,590
Why did the flying Shinobi escape
to the dangerous Valley of Death?
143
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,640
Even though he got the star,
144
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,590
why did he go so far as
to take Sumaru away?
145
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,800
Come to think of it… Why is that?
146
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,390
The quality of Chakra of
the one who took the star
147
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,590
and the one who took Sumaru away
were completely different.
148
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,260
– Huh?! 					– What?!
149
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,220
Say what?!
150
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,720
That’s right…
There are two masked Shinobi!
151
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,260
What does that mean?
152
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,430
In my opinion, there’s more to
this mission than meets the eye.
153
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,800
As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku,
Lady Natsuhi.
154
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,220
Where is he…? Where’s Sumaru?!
155
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,050
Before that, I’ll have you return
the star to me…
156
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,050
I’ll trade it for Sumaru!
157
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,590
The star first!
158
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,590
I refuse!
159
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,640
Then I’ll take it back by force
if I have to!
160
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,590
What’s so funny?!
161
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,640
Akahoshi…
You’re no competition to me.
162
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,220
Even after you left the village,
163
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,220
a few of us who were interested
continued training in secret!
164
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,140
You think you have completed
the star training
165
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,430
by training on your own?
166
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,430
Verify with your own eyes whether
or not I’m no competition!
167
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,220
Ninja Art: Kujaku!
168
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,720
Beast!
169
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,300
Such a folly… I have no choice.
170
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,430
Ninja Art: Kujaku… Beast!
171
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,590
Wha--?!
172
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,430
To think she’d be this tough…
173
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,390
Yotaka! Shisou!
174
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,260
Go!
175
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,050
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
176
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,590
What’re you thinking, Akahoshi?!
177
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,550
I’ll have you play along with me
a little while longer…Lady Natsuhi.
178
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,720
Huh? What is it?
179
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,510
A flow of massive Chakra…
180
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,510
Is it him?!
181
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
No mistake!
182
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,220
Oh?! Who is it?!
183
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,220
Our helper from the Leaf…
184
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,930
The Shinobi who seized the star
has appeared!
185
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,390
Lord Akahoshi is now delaying
that person…
186
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,220
Please fight with us!
187
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,550
All right! Let’s hurry!
188
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,220
The enemy’s power is mighty
and Lord Akahoshi alone cannot…
189
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,220
It’s all he can do to delay the enemy.
190
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,300
Right. Leave it to us!
191
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,680
It seems nobody’s here.
192
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,930
It seems they’ve gone out…
193
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,510
There’s a faint presence
inside the residence.
194
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,590
Now’s our chance. Let’s infiltrate!
195
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,470
Right!
196
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,890
Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu!
197
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,510
What?! Lee?
198
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,590
Since when could you use Ninjutsu…?
199
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,890
Tenten! It’s okay. There’s nobody in here!
200
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,600
Hey, that’s not Ninjutsu!
201
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,050
Kind of…
202
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,470
Suspicious, eh?
203
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,640
Yikes!
204
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,010
Uh…uh, oh…
205
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,220
Well… I guess I can do it later.
206
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,760
It seems to be a medical room…
207
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,470
Somebody’s being laid down in a bed.
208
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,590
I wonder who it is?
209
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,550
That’s…!
210
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,600
Sumaru!
211
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,260
Why did you make Sumaru and
the others do that star training?
212
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,180
You should’ve been told by
the Third Hoshikage
213
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,800
about how dangerous that training is!
214
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,680
You yourself…are the answer to that!
215
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,760
What?!
216
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,510
That Chakra is wonderful!
217
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,970
It would make for great fighting strength
218
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,140
if we had one hundred, no,
even ten Shinobi like you!
219
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,100
The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villages
would be no match for us
220
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,220
even if they all ganged up on us!
221
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,100
It’s still not too late.
222
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,220
Let’s make this village into
an invincible Hidden Star Village!
223
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,390
It hurts… It hurts…
224
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,350
My body feels like it is on fire!
225
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,600
Help me…
226
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,010
I must train… Star training…
227
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,430
– That’s enough… That’s enough.
– For the sake of Hidden Star Village…
228
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,680
There’s no need to do
such painful training!
229
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,970
That sorrow must not be repeated…
230
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,680
If you’re saying you’re going to
continue this any further…!
231
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,720
W-Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die!
232
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,590
You can’t do it! Natsuhi!
233
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,680
Sumaru, who is more important
than your life, is in my hands!
234
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,390
There he is!
He’s moving in on Akahoshi!
235
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,180
All right!
I won’t let him get away this time.
236
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,970
Wait! He’s not an opponent
you can take on from the front.
237
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,970
I’ve got a plan.
238
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,890
A plan…?
239
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,680
I’ll stop his Chakra,
so I leave the rest to you!
240
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,600
Indeed, the situation will get worse
if we’re too slow.
241
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
Got it! Be careful, Naruto!
242
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,890
All right! Let’s go!
243
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,010
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
244
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,550
– Let’s go! 					– Let’s go!
245
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,970
You again?!
246
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,600
It’s more than I imagined.
247
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,600
It’s impossible from the front, after all.
248
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,760
What?!
249
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,430
Where’s the real body?!
250
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,590
Oh, no!
251
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,300
I get it.
252
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,680
When controlling massive Chakra,
253
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,640
less attention is paid to the area around
the main body in spite of everything…
254
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,550
Good thinking, Naruto!
255
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,720
He… He did it…
256
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,430
A woman…?!
257
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,600
The Hidden Leaf Kid has done it…
258
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,550
I can find the star if I take the time…
259
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,590
But now’s my only chance
to defeat Natsuhi!
260
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,640
As long as she interferes, I won’t be able
to carry out my ambitions!
261
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,590
Ninja Art: Kujaku!
262
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,890
Beast!
263
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,970
Naruto! Look out!
264
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,180
Shoot!
265
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,010
Naruto!
266
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,140
Something the matter, Mizura…?
267
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,800
No… It’s nothing…
268
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,640
Naruto…
269
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,470
Mother…
270
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,760
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
271
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,590
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
272
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,100
Yellow Moon.
273
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:58,930
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
274
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,140
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
275
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:11,100
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
276
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:17,970
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
277
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,680
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
278
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,590
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
279
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,220
A magical chord change, in a restless city
280
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,260
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
281
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,140
Oh! Everybody, I just realized
something important!
282
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,350
What is it all of the sudden?
283
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,470
Sumaru was being captured
by Akahoshi!
284
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,970
Which means that the culprit who attacked
everyone was Akahoshi!
285
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,800
And?
286
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,140
Believe it or not!
One of the masked Shinobi is Akahoshi.
287
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,180
Neji said that long time ago, remember?
288
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Excellent, Neji.
You are a sharp one!
289
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,640
Can we move on?
290
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,100
Next time:
“Hoshikage: The Buried Truth”
//%
1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,460
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,960
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,580
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,170
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,580
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,580
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,250
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,080
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,380
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,750
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,040
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,630
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,210
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,710
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,330
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,920
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,630
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,040
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,420
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,870
We’re almost at
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
21
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,540
Is everybody here?
22
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,630
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
23
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,250
Big Brother Omasa,
we’re missing one!
24
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,580
What? Who is it?!
25
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,540
It’s Idate! Morino Idate!
26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,040
Darn, he's such a hopeless kid!
27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,330
What should we do?
Shall we wait?
28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
We have no choice…
29
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,130
What the--?!
30
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,670
Who is it?!
31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,630
You people are from the Wasabi Family
of the Land of Tea, correct?
32
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,580
Who are you!
33
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,920
You should know your place.
34
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,580
Hooligans like you people
are no match for a Shinobi!
35
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,380
Please don’t worry.
I won’t take your lives.
36
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,920
If you’ve learned from this,
37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,330
you should give up the race
at Todoroki Great Shrine.
38
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,540
Blast it!
39
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,870
I have to at least deliver this letter
to the Hidden Leaf Village.
40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,870
OK! Mission! Mission!
I’m so eager to do it!
41
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,290
But Kakashi Sensei is not here.
42
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,580
Is he late as usual?
43
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,870
No, Kakashi will not be coming.
44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,040
It's Old Lady Tsunade!
45
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,460
Don’t call me an old lady!
46
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,870
Excuse me… Lady Hokage…
47
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,080
What do you mean by
Kakashi Sensei will not be coming?
48
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,630
As you three already know,
49
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,750
most of the Jonin including Kakashi
are on different missions.
50
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,420
This time, the three of you will have
to execute the mission by yourselves.
51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,830
This is a B-rank mission,
escorting an important figure!
52
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,580
Escorting an important figure…
53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,870
Of course,
depending on the situation,
54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,000
the mission has the possibility
of becoming an A-rank.
55
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,830
And, who are we protecting?
56
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,630
Don’t know…
57
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,080
What do you mean
“don’t know”?!
58
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,960
In the neighboring nation
of the Land of Tea,
59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,290
they have a Dedication Ceremony
at the Todoroki Great Shrine
60
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,870
once every four years.
61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,880
We’ve received a request
to escort the runner
62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,080
who will be participating in
the race that will be held there.
63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,250
But an assailant from the opponent’s side
64
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,500
attacked the messengers
before they arrived here.
65
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,170
Assailant?
66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,790
Excuse me, but I still don’t
quite understand the mission.
67
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,170
Well, you should get the details
directly from Boss Jirocho.
68
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,960
Boss Jirocho?! Oh yeah!
The boss from that time!
69
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,870
That’s it.
70
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,000
Now that you three understand,
depart immediately!
71
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,080
Get to the Land of Tea by today.
Snap to it!
72
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,040
– Yes! 					– All right.
73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,830
Okay!
74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,580
Roger that!
75
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,040
I’m counting on you.
76
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,870
Mission! Help an Old Friend
in the Land of Tea
77
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,710
Hey Sakura, aren’t you hungry?
78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,210
Well, a little bit…
79
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,870
Then it’s decided!
80
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,130
And perfect timing!
There’s a teahouse right over there!
81
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,870
Hey, Naruto.
82
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,710
You’re here…?
83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,420
Aoi Rokusho has now arrived.
84
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,870
I had you go through
all that trouble,
85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,880
but Jirocho of the Wasabi
does not know when to give up.
86
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,630
Is he still trying to take part
in the race at Todoroki Great Shrine?
87
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,290
That’s right.
88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,130
And there’s new information
that they have also hired Shinobi.
89
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,750
I see…
90
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,000
Then next time, let’s beat them
to a pulp at the race…
91
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,080
Welcome!
92
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,750
Ma’am, I’ll have sweet bean soup.
93
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,290
Then I’ll have dumplings.
94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,870
How about you, Sasuke?
95
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,460
Jelly…
96
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,870
All right, please wait for a moment.
97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,330
Ninja from the Leaf…
98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,870
I’m gonna work so hard!
99
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,000
Naruto, don’t take unnecessary action
by yourself.
100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,420
Oh, okay.
101
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,870
Having sweet bean soup
when it's so nice outside.
102
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,630
The Ninja profession sure
is carefree!
103
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,540
What did you say?
104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,750
Things must really be peaceful
for the Leaf Village.
105
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,210
Such a dense-looking
bunch of guys…
106
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,330
What?!
107
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,880
Hey! I didn’t know there was
such a cutie here.
108
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,130
I take back that previous comment!
109
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,080
Ah…pardon me.
110
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,870
I'm Idate Morino.
111
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,670
What’s your name, young lady?
112
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,500
Don’t you talk to Sakura
in such a familiar tone!
113
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,500
Sakura… That’s a good name.
114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey, even a chance meeting is due
to karma from a previous life.
115
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,000
Why don’t we talk about our future?
116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,750
Huh? Talk about…the future?
117
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,870
I’m talking about you quitting
the Ninja life and becoming my bride…
118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,290
Hey you! How dare you
hit on her all of a sudden!
119
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,630
Don’t be silly!
120
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,920
Just joking.
121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,920
But hey, you fool!
122
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,540
Idate here hates Ninja!
123
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,080
If you wander around
the Land of Tea anymore,
124
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,500
there’ll be a price to pay!
125
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,330
That’s amusing! Bring it on!
126
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,080
Hey, Naruto!
127
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,330
Ridiculous! We don’t have time
to waste on a hooligan.
128
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,040
Be quiet, Sasuke!
129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,870
I’m not going to forgive a guy
who makes fun of Shinobi!
130
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,380
I’m going to punish this guy…
131
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,000
Huh?
132
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,870
He’s gone…
133
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,210
Impossible!
I didn’t even notice…
134
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,380
Where did that guy run away to?!
135
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,170
Here, thank you for waiting.
136
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,130
Dang it!
137
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,630
Thank you for your patronage.
138
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,380
What? Two bills?
139
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,330
This is…?
140
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,330
Oh, that kid who was here left,
saying that you guys would pay.
141
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,960
That guy!
How dare he make fools of us!
142
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,210
The sound of footsteps is far off…
He has considerable speed!
143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,960
He made us look like idiots!
144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,630
I can’t stay quiet.
We have to chase him!
145
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,920
Missus, thank you very much.
I’ll leave the money here.
146
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,630
Thanks!
147
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,380
All the customers today
seem to be in such a hurry.
148
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,540
He has incredible speed.
He must have trained very hard.
149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,080
Who is he?
150
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,130
Doesn’t matter, we’re definitely
going to catch up to him!
151
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,040
Stupid Ninja!
152
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,920
There’s no way
they can catch up to me!
153
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,870
Owww!
154
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,420
Darn it… Swift Runner Idate
makes a mistake of a lifetime!
155
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,870
Serves you right!
156
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,170
You have some nerve,
trying to run away from us.
157
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,250
I’m so sorry!
158
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,830
Huh?
159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,250
I’m sorry…
160
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,290
I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss,
then you guys showed up.
161
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,040
So I did that…
162
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,870
You kinda feel sorry
after hearing his story.
163
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,960
Then you should have said that
from the start!
164
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Ow! Huh…?
165
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,460
What’s this?
166
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,420
Don’t touch it!
167
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,870
This is mine!
168
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,000
Wh-What the…?!
169
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,920
On your mark.
170
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,420
Get set…
171
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,870
Go!
172
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,500
Weights?
173
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,250
Try to catch me now, you idiots!
174
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,750
Hey! He escaped again!
175
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,880
That guy!
176
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,420
He simply doesn’t get it!
177
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,870
Is he for real?
178
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,500
What a speed…!
179
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,880
No way!
Even we can’t catch up to him…?
180
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,210
That’s it. We don't have a chance
of catching up.
181
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,790
Dang it! He'll get it
when I see him next time!
182
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,920
All of you, thanks for coming.
183
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,870
Begging your pardon!
Begging your pardon!
184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,500
I was born and raised
in the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
185
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,960
I was bathed in birth water
at “Ichiraku Ramen.”
186
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,380
My given name is Naruto
and the surname is Uzumaki.
187
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,870
People call me--
188
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,880
Loser!
189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,290
Loser…? Nah, not that!
190
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,870
You’re funny as usual.
191
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,330
Boss Jirocho,
you're looking good yourself.
192
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,710
Hey, Naruto!
193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,870
That's okay.
A boy should be this spunky.
194
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,830
The greetings seem to be done,
so I’ll get to the main topic.
195
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,830
The Fifth Hokage told us to get
the details of this mission from you.
196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
Yes, in fact…
197
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,710
Do you know of the Dedication Ceremony
at the Todoroki Great Shrine?
198
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,540
To…Todo…what?
199
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,870
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
200
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,330
The legend goes…
201
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,870
A long time ago,
in order to subdue a storm,
202
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,420
Ryuko’s Jewels were dedicated
to the Todoroki Great Shrine
203
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,870
and the storm subsided.
204
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,210
It became a customary event
that happens once every four years.
205
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,870
At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels,
but several decades ago,
206
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,500
it became a festival in which
the first-place runner
207
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,460
became the man of the year.
208
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,870
In recent years, the festival has
taken on another face.
209
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,210
For ages now,
in this port town of Degarashi,
210
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,460
two families,
the Wasabi and the Wagarashi,
211
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,960
have controlled local operations
and policed the town.
212
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,870
It’s embarrassing,
213
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,420
but conflict between the two families
has never ceased and
214
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,040
there have been numerous skirmishes
over territorial rights.
215
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,330
As the struggle intensified,
216
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,420
the town residents became entangled
and even got injured…
217
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,750
In order to put a stop to the conflict,
for the first time,
218
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,920
there was talk of some kind of mediation
in the presence of the lord.
219
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,580
And it was agreed that the power holder
of the town
220
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,000
would be determined in a contest
rather than through brawls.
221
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,330
So that contest is…
222
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,870
It is the Todoroki Great Shrine
Dedication Ceremony
223
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,750
that is held every four years.
224
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,830
Four years ago, the Wagarashi
easily won by hiring a Shinobi,
225
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,210
and we have learned that
they've hired a Shinobi again this year.
226
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,420
In order to counteract that,
227
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,920
we sent messengers to
the Hidden Leaf Village with a request,
228
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,870
but they were ambushed and attacked.
229
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,790
I beg you guys!
230
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,870
Please lend us your power.
231
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,710
We cannot afford to lose this race
to the Wagarashi Family!
232
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,790
Leave it to me!
233
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,170
And, who do you want us
to escort?
234
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, so you’ll take this job?
235
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,500
Did you call for me, Boss?
236
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,790
Oh, you guys know each other?
Then that makes the story fast.
237
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,870
That might not actually
be the case…
238
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,710
Boss Jirocho is an important person!
239
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,380
By rights, he shouldn’t bow
his head to Ninja like you!
240
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,460
Even if he did bow his head,
I’d flatly refuse to escort a guy like you.
241
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,380
Oh yeah?!
242
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,710
As if I’d go with some guy who came
from who-knows-where!
243
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,870
"Some guy from who-knows-where"?!
244
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,870
I am the brilliant Ninja,
Naruto Uzumaki,
245
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,080
who will eventually inherit
the name of Hokage!
246
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,670
Hah! Hokage is no big deal!
247
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,540
Hah! The boss of hooligans
is even less of a big deal!
248
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,870
You idiot! Boss Jirocho is
a very honorable person!
249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The Hokage is a great Shinobi
250
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,290
who puts his life on the line
to protect the village!
251
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,750
Boss Jirocho is a very,
very, very honorable person
252
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,710
who always puts his life
on the line to protect the town!
253
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,880
Hokage is more, more,
more incredible!
254
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,870
Even though it’s a tourist resort,
everything seems so expensive.
255
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,540
Sorry about that.
lt sure is expensive, isn't it?
256
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,870
Oh no, I didn’t mean…
257
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,920
We actually don’t want to sell
at this kind of price,
258
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,420
but after the Wagarashi family
came into power…
259
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,540
P-Please forgive me!
260
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,500
How dare you?!
261
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,130
Do you know who you have
to thank to do business?
262
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,870
Are you actually thinking about turning
against the Wagarashi Family?
263
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,000
N-Not at all.
But I have to get paid…
264
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,790
You’re slow to understand.
265
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
– Hey! 					– Yes, sir!
266
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,500
P-Please stop!
267
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,170
Huh! First of all, we’ll destroy you…
268
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,580
Wh-Who are you?!
269
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,920
Get out of here before you get hurt!
270
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,380
– What?! 					– What?!
271
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,870
Please run away!
272
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,710
These people are from
the Wagarashi…
273
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,750
It’ll be fine.
274
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,710
– You punk! 					– Wise guy!
275
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,870
We’ll let you go for today!
276
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,870
If you’ve learned your lesson,
never defy us again, kid!
277
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,870
Or you’ll pay when
we see you next time!
278
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,380
– Y-You won’t get away with this!
– Y-You won’t get away with this!
279
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,250
Young man…
280
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,290
Thank you very much.
281
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,870
What a refreshing feeling!
282
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,920
We definitely need Boss Jirocho's
Wasabi Family to win the upcoming race.
283
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,670
Sasuke…
284
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,870
Yeah…
285
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,040
Boss…
286
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,170
Of all people,
did you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi?
287
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,290
Don’t sulk like that, Idate.
288
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,290
I'm not sulking.
289
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,080
It’s just that…
290
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,130
Idate…
291
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,630
I believe in you more
than anybody else.
292
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,080
The rest depends on you.
293
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,920
Why don’t you believe
in people a little?
294
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,880
Idate…
295
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,830
please run for this town.
296
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,630
I beg you!
297
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,500
Boss…
298
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:34,920
Okay.
299
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,750
Even in exchange for my life…
300
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,870
Wow, I didn’t think it was going
to be this big!
301
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,870
But what kind of race is it?
302
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,330
I’ll explain the course so
a dummy like you can understand.
303
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,670
The starting point is Degarashi Port.
304
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,420
After the start, you head for
Modoroki Shrine which is the midway point.
305
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,580
This is Modoroki Shrine…?
306
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,540
Yes… It seems the fastest way
to get to Modoroki Shrine
307
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,830
is to use a boat from here.
308
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,870
Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewels
from Modoroki Shrine and
309
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,500
dedicate that jewel at the
Todoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu Island.
310
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,870
That's the only rule
for the race.
311
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,290
So shortcuts, obstructions,
and secret maneuvers are all allowed.
312
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,330
So hiring a Ninja is not
a violation of the rule either.
313
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,790
Who are the Ninja that
the other side hired?
314
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,630
They’re hiding somewhere
and checking the situation.
315
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,870
Don’t be careless, Naruto!
316
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,250
R-Right!
317
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,540
You guys can just relax and watch.
Don’t follow me around!
318
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,670
What?!
319
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,920
I’m saying I don’t want
an impediment.
320
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,130
You!
321
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,500
Calm down.
Let’s join forces here.
322
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,790
– Not with a guy like this!
– Not with a guy like this!
323
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,670
They seem to strangely be
in harmony, these two.
324
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,870
All right, everybody!
325
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,380
The Todoroki Great Shrine Race
will start soon!
326
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,420
Wasabi Family's runner,
ldate Morino!
327
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,870
Idate…Morino?
328
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,290
Wagarashi Family’s runner,
Fukusuke Hikyakuya!
329
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,630
On your mark!
330
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,170
Start!
331
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,250
All right! We’re going too!
332
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,750
Wh-What the--?!
333
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,250
Is he running away?!
334
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,170
Where are you going, Idate?!
335
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,670
Hey, wait!
336
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,870
Wh-What is he doing…?
337
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,920
Wait!
338
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,960
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,460
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
340
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,630
On your still shoulder
341
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,250
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
342
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,870
The city lights are like pieces of stars
343
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,750
That hold us together
344
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:58,380
“Each one of us glows differently,”
345
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,040
you say laughingly
346
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,920
but you look most dazzling
347
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,870
Like a comet,
348
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,040
like the rainbow after the storm
349
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:25,250
You bring light into my heart
350
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:35,710
Being lost can be the answer
351
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:44,540
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
352
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,630
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
353
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,830
What the heck is he thinking?!
That idiot!
354
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,000
So fast. He's moving at
an incredible speed.
355
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,870
Darn it! The opponent's already
far out at sea!
356
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,670
This is bad!
357
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,210
If the distance between them gets
any greater, it'll be impossible to win!
358
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,170
That idiot!
359
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,290
– Kick it up a notch, Sakura!
– Right!
360
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,920
We're gonna bring him back at all cost
and make up the difference!
361
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,920
Next time: "The Race is On!
Trouble on the High Seas!"
362
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,870
Don't miss it!
//%
1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,500
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,250
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,990
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,540
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,040
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:45,990
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,370
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:06,160
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:15,750
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,910
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,870
Run! The Curry of Life
12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,660
Why…do you go that far…?
13
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,120
I’ll get so strong that Guy Sensei
can look at me with a smile…
14
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,450
That is my Way of Ninja!
15
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,000
I see… So you live for the sake
of Guy or whatever…
16
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,990
Then have that Guy person
give you a funeral!
17
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,990
I’m sure he’ll think of your hard work
and cry for you!
18
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,990
Ninja Art…
19
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,200
Thunder Dragon Tornado!
20
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,870
One, two!
21
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,160
Mom, don’t push!
I can’t run that fast!
22
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,410
Oh my, this isn’t the time
for complaining!
23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,120
Please, hurry!
24
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,990
I’ll go on ahead, okay?!
25
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,990
Oh my!
26
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,990
Where’d he disappear to…?
Has he evaporated to the bone…?
27
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,990
Hey! Hang in there!
28
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,160
One, two…!
29
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,450
One, two…!
30
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
I’ve had it…
31
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,990
Grandma Sansho, the curry of life!
32
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,990
One…
33
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,580
Two!
34
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,500
I'll look after Lee.
35
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,910
So give Neji and Naruto
some curry!
36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,040
Ranmaru, wait here.
37
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,410
Right.
38
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,660
I’m going to Naruto!
Please look after Lee.
39
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,580
You too, get your butt to Neji!
40
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,830
Oh… right, Mom.
41
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,580
Right… Open Lee’s mouth.
42
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, right!
43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,790
Here!
44
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,990
So even the curry of life
won’t work, huh…?
45
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,750
Oh my!
46
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,790
Oh my…
47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,620
You little--! This isn’t the time
to be passing out!
48
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,290
Hot!
49
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,990
What’re you doing, believe it?!
50
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,990
Are you awake?
51
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,410
Oh, Tenten?
Didn’t you fall off the cliff?!
52
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,290
You should’ve realized
that was his trap!
53
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,990
What?! I was totally snow-jobbed,
believe it!
54
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,450
Neji, Neji!
55
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,370
It’s the curry of life!
Eat this and get better.
56
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,990
Neji?!
57
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,080
Neji!
58
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,330
Oh my, thank goodness he got better!
59
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,250
What?
60
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,410
The world is spinning…
61
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,910
He’s acting kind of strange…
62
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,410
Oh my…
63
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,410
One, two…
64
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,080
Put the curry of life in this,
pot and all.
65
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,330
Okay.
66
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,250
Hot!
67
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,950
Oww!
68
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,200
Oh! The curry…
69
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,370
This is bad!
70
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,370
Don’t worry about it. Move it!
71
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,990
On account of that wine…
72
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,200
Will he be okay?
73
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh my, there’s a slight problem
with the ingredients…
74
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,120
But there shouldn’t be
much difference in efficacy.
75
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,080
But…
76
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,870
Oh my…!
77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
He’s coming this way.
78
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,120
It’s okay! I’ll go…
79
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,000
You’re still alive?!
I have to finish you off…
80
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,160
Raiga…
81
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,620
You’re alive, Ranmaru?!
82
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,330
It’s Ranmaru!
83
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,410
That kid gave Raiga his own Chakra
and brought him back to life…
84
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,370
What?!
85
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,160
Raiga looked at Ranmaru
who was unconscious
86
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,450
and assumed he was dead…
87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,660
So that’s why he was saying
all that gibberish
88
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,120
about Ranmaru watching
from high above.
89
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,080
And I managed to get Ranmaru
to the Curry of Life Shop.
90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,790
So that’s what happened…
91
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,580
We’ll again be together forever,
Ranmaru…
92
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,290
Let’s kill them and have fun
doing lots of bad things.
93
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,370
Right, Raiga…
94
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,080
Some fog has appeared.
95
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,990
It’s okay.
I’ll be your eyes again, Raiga…
96
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,750
Right. There’s nothing to be afraid of
if I’m with you, Ranmaru.
97
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,160
Now, let’s go, Raiga!
98
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,450
What about them?
99
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,990
They’re dead now…
100
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,200
Right…Shall we search
for our next prey?
101
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,370
But there’s a precipitous cliff ahead!
102
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,990
That Ranmaru, what’s he going to do?!
103
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,990
Could it be…
104
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,990
he’s going to atone for the past sins
together with Raiga?!
105
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,540
He might be planning to lead Raiga
over that cliff and die together!
106
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,910
Wh-What?!
107
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,990
What’s with you, jerk?!
108
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,990
What?!
109
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,540
Lee…
110
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,080
Hey…
111
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,700
Here I go…!
112
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,870
What?!
113
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,040
You…brat!
114
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,290
He suddenly recovered!
115
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,450
Knock it off!
116
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,250
He’s fast!
117
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,580
You okay, Ranmaru?
118
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,000
You stay here!
119
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,700
Take me with you…
120
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Oh! Ranmaru!
121
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,160
Where’d you go, Ranmaru?!
122
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,410
You little--! You’re going to pay for this!
123
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,990
Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!
124
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,990
Now…
125
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,660
Bring it!
126
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,290
Knock it off!
127
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,830
Here I go…
128
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,250
That was a heck of a blow.
129
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,750
If I hadn’t put on the Thunder Armor;
I’d be giving myself a funeral.
130
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,290
In order to remember your hard work
I’ll give you your funeral myself!
131
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,000
Wait!
132
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,790
What’s the idea…?
133
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,580
I want to feed you…
the curry of life, too.
134
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,990
Huh?!
135
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,120
You’ll realize that you’re not alone
if you eat the curry…
136
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,250
Everyone’s feelings are blended in…
137
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,290
What’re you saying?!
138
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,870
Let’s stop hurting people…
139
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,990
Cut it out!
140
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,990
You’re my eyes and ears!
141
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,660
We’ll no longer be two people in one
if you say such selfish things!
142
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,830
Shoot your lightning…
143
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,990
If I die, the strong Raiga will also die…
We’re two in one, so…
144
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,330
I…won’t be able to remember you
from when you were cool…
145
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,250
I must give you a funeral!
146
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,990
Stop…Raiga!
147
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,950
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
148
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,990
There are lots of Narutos…
149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,910
Did I get drunk?
150
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,620
You little--! It makes no difference,
no matter how many of you there are!
151
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,250
Neji, wake up!
152
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,790
What’re you doing, Neji?
153
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,120
Eat this and get it together!
We’ve got trouble here!
154
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,410
That’s…
155
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,990
What?!
156
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,370
Now we’ve done it…
157
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,540
You’re going to kill by your own hand
the friend who risked his life to save you?!
158
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,620
Wha--?! Ranmaru betrayed me…
159
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,870
He broke the promise for it
to be just us two forever!
160
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,870
He’s not all alone anymore!
161
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
He figured out that it’s more fun…
162
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,000
to laugh with everyone
than to cry with you!
163
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,990
Naruto…
164
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,870
Ranmaru, you were going to die
with Raiga, weren’t you?!
165
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,580
Don’t be thinking about
something like that anymore!
166
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,660
You’re free now!
167
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,500
Don't worry. I won’t let Raiga
give you a funeral, no matter what!
168
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,830
Hey, don’t be shooting off your mouth,
you shrimp.
169
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,410
Say what?!
170
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,870
Don’t underestimate me.
I’m Raiga Kurosuki!
171
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,870
I’ve been counted before as one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
172
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,950
I won’t take orders from
the likes of you!
173
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,410
Oh. That’s right.
He’s a Ninja Swordsman, huh?
174
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,950
If you’re one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist,
175
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,080
then I’ve got something to ask you.
176
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,620
You know the guy called Kisame, right?!
177
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,450
Kisame? I hate that guy!
178
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,700
So I’ll give him a funeral for sure
the next time I see him!
179
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,580
What?!
180
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,750
I hate him.
181
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,990
I hate all the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist!
182
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,160
Ranmaru. You’re the only one
who’s a friend to me…
183
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,000
But Ranmaru…
you’ve made other friends…
184
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,450
We’re not two in one anymore…
185
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,410
Raiga…
186
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,040
Impudent!
187
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,790
Who do you think taught you
about the outside world?!
188
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,990
It’s a funeral for you!
189
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,410
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!
190
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,250
You little…
191
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,790
Clone… Body Slam!
192
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,790
Ranmaru…
193
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,660
Now you're free…
194
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,450
Raiga?!
195
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,700
Thunder! Give me my funeral!
196
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,910
One, two… One…
197
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,990
Not loud enough!
198
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,250
– You can’t make genuine curry of life…
– One, two…
199
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,830
– if you don’t stir it with all your heart!
– One, two…
200
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,040
Oh my!
201
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,250
Ouch… What’re you doing, Mom?!
202
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,500
Oh my, Karashi!
203
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,790
It’s a hundred years too soon for you
to be uttering the word "genuine"!
204
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,790
You too, start your training over again
from the beginning!
205
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,500
What?!
206
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,790
Grandma Sansho!
207
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,250
We’ll be leaving now!
208
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,950
Thanks for your help.
209
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,450
I leave Ranmaru to you!
210
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,910
Oh my… I’ll train him mercilessly
as a successor…
211
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,370
to the preparation of the curry of life!
212
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,990
Good luck, Ranmaru, Karashi.
213
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,540
– Thanks! 					– Thanks!
214
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,290
Oh my… It’s a long way
to the Village Hidden in Leaves.
215
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,990
I made you guys some special curry
216
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,450
that’ll give you guys ten thousand times
the strength.
217
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,200
Be on your way after having some.
218
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,620
What’s this very spicy-looking
bright red color…?
219
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,580
It kind of hurts my eyes, believe it!
220
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh! That looks good!
221
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,450
– What? Seriously?!
– What? Seriously?!
222
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,540
Lady Tsunade will get mad at us
if we don’t get back soon!
223
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,160
You're right!
224
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,330
Unfortunately, we’ll have to be going now.
225
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,370
Wait!
226
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,830
Oh my, those kids were sure
diffident and reserved…
227
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,660
The curry… The curry…!
228
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:41,910
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
229
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:53,370
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
230
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:04,830
What dreams did you chase to get here?
231
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:16,990
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
232
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:28,330
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
233
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:39,990
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
234
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,700
I’ll be close to you
235
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,990
One’s duty as team captain:
236
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,910
"Issue appropriate instructions
to the subordinates,
237
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,990
protect the lives of your men and
promptly carry out your mission."
238
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,990
Awesome, that is so cool!
239
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,660
This is so perfect for me, Naruto, the man
who will eventually become a Hokage!
240
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,950
All right, I’ll use this to instantly get closer
to the title of Hokage, believe it!
241
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,370
Next time: “Follow My Lead!
The Great Survival Challenge!”
//%
1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,060
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,270
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,440
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,150
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,850
Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
13
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,890
Uh-oh!
14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,400
8 Trigrams 2 Palms!
15
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,940
4 Palms!
16
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,810
8 Palms!
17
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,980
16 Palms!
18
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,060
32 Palms!
19
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,890
64 Palms!
20
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,890
What’s going on?!
21
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,150
A golden body surface…?
22
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,440
It’s the same material as the weapon
he spit out of his mouth earlier…
23
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,310
That was close.
24
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,940
I hear that if you’re hit straight on
with Gentle Fist,
25
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,560
your Chakra Network gets damaged
26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,650
and you become unable
to build up Chakra…
27
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,440
That was close.
28
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,150
Are you a monster?
29
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,440
It seems to come
not just from your mouth.
30
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,350
Gum Style Spider Thread…
31
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,890
is a metal that hardens
the instant it leaves my body.
32
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,730
Moreover, it doesn’t let Chakra through.
33
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,520
And…it can be secreted
not just from my mouth,
34
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,810
but also from the sweat glands
throughout my body.
35
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,190
Attacks on Chakra points won’t work.
Now it makes sense…
36
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,770
The Spider Web Net won’t work.
37
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,690
And there’ll be no close-range
combat fighting
38
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,270
against a Gentle Fist opponent.
39
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,890
In other words,
40
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,890
I just have to attack the blind side
from long distance.
41
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,890
There’ll be no sound…
lt’ll be in a flash.
42
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,190
The game’s over.
43
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,440
The Kunai Knife is a fake!
44
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,150
What?!
45
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,350
8 Trigrams Palm…
46
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,020
Rotation!
47
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,400
Wha–?! What is that?!
48
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,270
Does he…have eyes behind him?!
49
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,020
And the defense just now…
50
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,600
He repelled physical attacks
with Chakra?!
51
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:35,520
360 Degrees of Vision:
The Byakugan's Blind Spot!
52
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,890
If we’re not prepared for
“one person, one kill,”
53
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,480
then it’s not going to work out…
54
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,310
That’s what you said earlier.
55
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,980
Hurry up and go!
I’ll catch up with you all!
56
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,890
We have to be prepared for
“one person, one kill.”
57
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,690
Naruto…
58
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,190
You’ve got better eyes than me.
59
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,100
Neji…
60
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,940
Catch up with us, no matter what!
61
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,100
Can he see me?!
62
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,150
What the heck is he?!
63
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
I know you’re there.
64
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,650
Come out.
65
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,020
Those eyes…
66
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,890
It seems they can do more
than just see through the Chakra flow…
67
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,810
So I see there was
an extraordinary Visual Jutsu user.
68
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,270
A long range battle
is unfavorable…
69
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,060
I must bring this to
close combat by all means.
70
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,980
Very well.
71
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,440
I’ll acknowledge that this game has
a somewhat high level of difficulty!
72
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,890
I too shall go for it seriously…
73
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,310
It’s like he’s a totally different person
from before…
74
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,060
His Chakra activity is overwhelming.
75
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,020
And those markings…
76
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,310
His move earlier…
77
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,520
He dodged an attack aimed
from behind
78
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,890
and was able to see me hiding
in the shadows.
79
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,060
In other words,
80
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,150
he has a combined wide range
of sight and X-ray vision.
81
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,730
And what’s more, that Jutsu…
82
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,480
If so…
83
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,310
Summoning Jutsu!
84
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,890
Your ability…
85
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,690
I’ll find a way to impeccably assault it.
86
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,060
If he defends
against physical attacks
87
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,600
with a large emission
of Chakra and its Rotation…
88
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,400
all I need to do then is to stop
that Chakra Rotation!
89
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,850
Scatter!
90
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,890
Rotation!
91
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,020
It’s starting to stop.
92
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,650
Here!
93
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,890
Die!
94
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,940
He released the Chakra just in time
and repelled the Kunai Knife!
95
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,100
To think he’d stop my Chakra Rotation
96
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,190
by binding it with Chakra threads…
97
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,520
These things…
98
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,940
I just have to cut them for now.
99
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,440
If the Rotation won’t do,
100
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,310
then I just have to dodge
each and every one.
101
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,020
This guy uses
close-range Taijutsu-style combat .
102
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,770
There will be no problem
if I fight him from afar.
103
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,890
In that way…
I’ll have a good long look at your ability.
104
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,270
8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!
105
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,520
What a number!
106
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,480
Hm?! His stance changed?!
107
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,890
8 Trigrams.
108
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,980
128 Palms!
109
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,770
He’s fast!
The number of strikes has doubled…!
110
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,440
If I get nailed by that straight on,
it'll be the end for me.
111
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,350
If that’s the case on his end,
112
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,690
then it’ll be a battle of numbers
on this end, too!
113
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,650
The number’s too great!
I won’t have enough time!
114
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,020
The Rotation’s no good,
just as I thought…
115
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,890
It seems he has 360-degree vision.
116
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,730
And it seems he deals
with enemy attacks
117
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,270
by combining his X-ray vision ability
for seeing through things
118
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,480
and his telescopic vision ability
for long-distance sight.
119
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,690
Furthermore, although
he’s got 360-degree vision,
120
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,890
that vision has a formidable extent…
121
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,440
If I were to determine the range
from his reaction before…
122
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,850
he almost unfailingly detected
the Kunai Knives
123
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,480
that entered the approximately
150-foot circumference around him.
124
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,890
But for some reason,
125
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,100
there are Kunai Knives
he can’t evade completely.
126
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,900
If so…
127
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,400
8 Trigrams, Sixty…
128
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,440
I see…
129
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,890
This time, there’ll be even more.
130
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,890
This time, two will hit…
131
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,900
I’ve found a way to impeccably
assault your ability!
132
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,400
It seems that defense technique
133
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,890
was something to compensate
for this weak point!
134
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,350
In other words...
Your Visual Jutsu isn’t perfect!
135
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,810
Why even bother?!
I’ve won the game!
136
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,890
Come on. Are you going to
keep at it for naught?
137
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,520
The fate of the small fry character in an
easy game is to be destroyed right away!
138
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,520
You can’t beat me!
139
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,940
– I-I’m not done yet.
– Lee…
140
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,270
You never give up do you?
141
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,520
No way you can beat him.
He’s a genius unlike you.
142
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,520
Genius? What is genius anyway!
143
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,480
Even without any talent,
I’ll surpass “genius” by working hard.
144
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,190
It’s no use, Lee.
145
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,890
No matter how hard you work,
you cannot beat me.
146
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,520
It’s already decided.
147
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,350
Lady Hinata...
148
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,600
You’re the sheltered little baby
of the main branch.
149
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,150
A person can never change.
150
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,060
And then, this match…
151
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,890
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.
152
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,400
You don’t know until you try!
153
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,770
This is the end…
154
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,190
Gentle Fist!
155
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,730
Small fry character one…
Destruction completed.
156
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,600
Well, for a crummy game,
I was entertained…
157
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,770
Heh… I missed the fatal spots, huh?
158
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,310
And he wouldn’t easily die from
Kunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh?
159
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,900
I see…
He’s still going to entertain me, huh?
160
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,520
This is thanks for that.
161
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Seriously, that fat Jirobo
can’t be helped,
162
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,890
but what’s that clod Kidomaru
doing anyway…?
163
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,690
That lowlife!
164
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,520
He’s got the habit of playing games.
165
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,230
Maybe he’s found someone
to entertain him?
166
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,480
When that idiot plays too much,
167
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,060
he becomes hyper
and easily gets into that state…
168
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,890
But still...
Once he gets to the second state…
169
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,850
it’s instant death for the opponent.
170
00:20:49,310 --> 00:21:01,060
Maximum destructive power…
with 100% accuracy!
171
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,890
Die!
172
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,600
For the first time, I spoke to you
173
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,730
And you smiled
174
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,150
For the first time, I was able to speak
175
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,900
In my own words
176
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,690
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
177
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,100
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
178
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,890
My clumsy attempts with words
179
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,600
You listened without turning away
180
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,890
No wonder I get carried away by you
181
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,890
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
182
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,980
I feel so sad
183
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,940
But…
184
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,520
For the first time, I spoke to you
185
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,560
And you smiled
186
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,230
For the first time, I was able to speak
187
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,310
In my own words
188
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,890
For the first time, I spoke to you
189
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,940
And you smiled
190
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,600
For the first time, I was able to speak
191
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,560
In my own words
192
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,100
For the first time, I spoke to you
193
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,270
He doesn’t carry out wasteful attacks.
194
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,350
And he accurately reads
information from the results.
195
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,890
No mistake, this guy’s the strongest
of all I’ve fought up until now!
196
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,810
I probably won’t be able
to evade the next attack.
197
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,890
I’ve had enough.
I can’t dodge it anyway.
198
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,770
Since the secret of my eyes
has been discovered, I won’t run or hide!
199
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,890
Next episode: “Losing is Not an Option!”
//%
1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:13,930
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
2
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,610
The distance created between us
became too big,
3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,550
because we were always together
4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,560
Your honest reply, “See you…”
5
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,300
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.
6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,900
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side
8
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:17,560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands
9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,960
I can feel it so close,
10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,230
Our two hearts
11
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,090
–Monju. 					–Yes, sir.
12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Darn, didn’t know there was a kid here.
13
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,950
I’ll do it.
14
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,610
Okay, it’s in your hands, Gantetsu.
15
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,460
Okay. Let’s pull out!
16
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,430
Set this place on fire!
17
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,770
Don’t leave any evidence.
18
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,830
The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts
19
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,340
Wait up!
20
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,550
Over here! You’re it. Try catching me!
21
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Darn…
22
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,850
–Yeah! 					–This way! This way!
23
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,680
I said wait!
24
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Lady Tsunade…
25
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,030
With regard to the next request…
26
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,500
What, there’s more?
27
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Yes.
28
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,770
Boy oh boy…
29
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,170
This is the last one
so please try to focus.
30
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,500
All right.
31
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,210
When the weather continues
to be warm like this…
32
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,540
And what’s the request?
33
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,880
About the escort for the convoy with
the fugitive who was secured…
34
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,350
What about it,
that’s hardly a difficult mission.
35
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,550
Well, actually there’s a bit
of a problem.
36
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,260
Please look at this.
37
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,300
I see. This is somewhat of
a nuisance.
38
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,300
All of the Jonin are out
on S-rank missions,
39
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,500
and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin
have been allocated elsewhere.
40
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,540
Who’s left?
41
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,110
Let’s see…well…
42
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,550
Multi-Clone Jutsu!
43
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,800
Let’s go, Bushy Brows!
44
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,810
Here goes, Naruto!
45
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,580
Leaf Hurricane!
46
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,020
You jerk!
47
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,860
Another serving of
Shadow Clones for you!
48
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
You ain’t seen nothing yet!
49
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
You let your guard down!
50
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,480
Pretty good, Bushy Brow…
51
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,390
The same to you, Naruto…
52
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,560
Naruto! Lee!
53
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,880
Hey, are you guys all right?
54
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,850
Hey, stop moving.
55
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,550
Sakura, can’t you be
a little more gentle?
56
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,160
Shut your mouth.
Really, you’re being reckless.
57
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,330
That’s not true, Sakura.
58
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,260
See, the 100-man
Shadow Clone grapples
59
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,560
are excellent training
for enhancing one’s Taijutsu skills.
60
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,540
It’s like killing two birds with
one stone for Naruto, too
61
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
because this kind of friendly training
lets him polish
62
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,470
his Shadow Clone skills
at the same time.
63
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,370
That’s exactly right.
64
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,980
What are you talking about?
All you’re doing is slugging it out.
65
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,350
This is what ends up happening
when two guys get together.
66
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,550
That’s right.
67
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,820
Anyway, this isn’t the time to be
acting carefree like that.
68
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,560
Lady Tsunade is calling for you.
69
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,560
Grandma Tsunade?
70
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,830
What does she want?
71
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Ninja Dropouts?
72
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,500
Yeah. 					Ninja Dropouts are
73
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,670
Rogue Ninja who,
of their own free will,
74
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,610
choose not to be Shinobi and leave
their respective villages to join up.
75
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,010
They’re a gang of thieves who use brutal
and villainous means to steal.
76
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,550
That’s horrible…using their abilities
as Ninja for criminal purposes.
77
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,820
That’s unforgivable.
78
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,320
One of their members was
captured yesterday
79
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,820
in Ogi Pass
in the Land of Forests.
80
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,720
This guy is the only member
81
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,460
whose wanted notice is
circling around the lands.
82
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,930
He was found wandering about
and taken prisoner.
83
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,570
His name is Gantetsu.
84
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,440
For a former Ninja,
that’s pretty lame.
85
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,170
Gantesu is being taken to
the capital city of the Land of Forests
86
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,080
in order to do an exhaustive investigation
into this matter
87
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,610
for the purpose of wiping out
the Ninja Dropouts…
88
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,750
However, there is a possibility
that the Ninja Dropouts will try
89
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,150
to rescue him along the way…
90
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,690
A police escort has been sent
from the capital
91
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
so it is fully prepared for the convoy.
92
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,390
But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,
93
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,060
the idea is that Shinobi would be
the best countermeasure for Shinobi,
94
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,560
so they requested that the Leaf Village
also send out some Ninja.
95
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,560
That’s what this request is all about.
96
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,270
I’m getting excited! I’ll show ‘em
how great Leaf Ninja are!
97
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,970
–Got it!
–Let’s give it a shot!
98
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,440
All right! Naruto Uzumaki,
Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee.
99
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,210
The three of you are assigned
to the mission
100
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,550
of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
101
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,680
–Yes, ma’am! 					–Roger!
102
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,220
Look, the harbor.
103
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,970
Huh… So they’re gonna
transport him in this.
104
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,600
The only way to get to the capital
of the Land of Forests is
105
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,170
to go up this river.
106
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,510
Hey, look over there.
107
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,550
That’s…
108
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,050
The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu.
109
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,690
Are you the Leaf Ninja?
110
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,690
Yes. Uh, and who are you?
111
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,760
I’m Tsuzumi with the police department.
112
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,890
I’m supervising this convoy.
113
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,830
My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
114
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,760
This guy here’s Bushy Brows and
her name is Sakura Haruno.
115
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,640
Hmmm… You guys are still kids…
Are you really Ninja?
116
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,310
We sure are.
117
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,070
Huh, we might not look it,
118
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,040
but we’re all full-fledged Ninja who’ve
been tested by fire numerous times.
119
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,210
We’ll display our skills for you
at some point.
120
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
Just leave it to us.
121
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,550
Well, I have a strong team of
experts handling security,
122
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,160
but if it ever comes to that,
123
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,090
I’m counting on you to use
your specialty, Ninjutsu.
124
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,530
Got it.
125
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,130
Those are the security personnel
guarding the prisoner.
126
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,140
They’re all dressed alike, aren’t they?
127
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,310
Huh, they don’t have much style.
128
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,210
Naruto, that’s rude.
129
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Captain Todoroki!
130
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,750
What is it, Commander Tsuzumi?
131
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
These people came from
132
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,090
the Village Hidden in the Leaves
as reinforcements.
133
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,320
The name’s Naruto Uzumaki.
134
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I’m Sakura Haruno.
135
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,930
My name is Rock Lee.
136
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Commander, I told you already.
137
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,630
We already have enough security on this.
138
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,270
Can’t be helped.
lt’s something the bosses decided.
139
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,610
There won’t be any role for
you guys to play.
140
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,980
We will guard Gantetsu.
141
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,250
I promise that on this sword.
142
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,550
Huh… That sword’s nothing.
143
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,690
Snapping that thing in half would be
as easy as apple pie.
144
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,550
Yeah, with just one finger.
145
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,260
Stop it, you guys!
Please excuse them…
146
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,960
Be careful not to get seasick.
147
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,730
Well, I leave it to you.
148
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,560
Y-Yes, sir. Thanks.
149
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,470
Gantetsu…
150
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,110
All right…
151
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,810
Put the cage into the belly of the ship!
152
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,550
Okay…Okay…
153
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,090
Okay, lower it!
154
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
Wow…
155
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,310
This feels great!
156
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,150
What the heck is this anyway?
157
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,550
They won’t let us even get near him.
158
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,850
They’re totally treating us like nuisances.
159
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,660
If only those Ninja Dropout guys
would launch an attack,
160
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,560
we could show them how awesome
we are.
161
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,760
Don’t say stupid things like that.
162
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,760
The best scenario would be that
the Ninja Dropout won’t show up at all.
163
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,570
Our mission is to transport Gantetsu
safely to the capital, you know.
164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,270
But this is getting too boring…
there’s no thrill to it.
165
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,540
Better just grin and bear it.
166
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,540
There are missions like this too.
167
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,550
Well, I sure understand
how you feel, Naruto.
168
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,720
Yeah… I guess this is getting
a little boring.
169
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,120
Dig in…
170
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,060
Gimme a break…
171
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,360
Who do those guys think we are?
172
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,090
But this stuff is pretty good.
173
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,560
Yeah, very tasty.
174
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,560
It makes me so mad…
175
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,540
I mean, why did we go to all
the trouble of coming all this way?
176
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,840
I’m gonna do my mission.
177
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,540
Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu.
178
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,050
But the captain’s gonna scold you.
179
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,510
I’m doing this out of Ninja pride!
180
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,750
Uh, Naruto!
181
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Naruto!
182
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,910
He does have the face of
a criminal after all.
183
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Todoroki?
184
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,750
What the heck is he doing here?
185
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,390
Akio…!
186
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Damn!
187
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,440
Father! Mother!
188
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,390
Akio…
189
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Akio!
190
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Damn!
191
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,630
Akio…!
192
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,070
I will avenge your death right now!
193
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Oh!
194
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,720
What the heck are you doing?!
195
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,560
Are you in your right mind?
196
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,930
What was it you were about
to do just now?!
197
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,980
Ninja Art: Crimson Mud.
198
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,470
Oh?
199
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,670
What’s the matter, Sakura?
200
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,480
Lee, over there.
201
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,180
That’s strange…
202
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,720
I’ve never knew this river has a tributary.
203
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,720
Why are you in here?
204
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,360
Why does that matter?
205
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,800
What were you about to do to Gantetsu!?
206
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,570
What are you talking about?
207
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,170
It looked to me like
you were going to kill him.
208
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,540
Huh? Me?
That’s a stupid thing to say.
209
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,540
It’s my mission to guard this guy.
Why would I?!
210
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,540
Yeah, I guess.
211
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,110
Even if he is a criminal,
212
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,120
you can’t just kill him off
without interrogating him first.
213
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,550
A brat talking like he knows, huh?
214
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,890
There isn’t any need to interrogate him!
215
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,560
This is the guy who did it!
216
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Huh?
217
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,060
This guy…
218
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,360
These guys…slaughtered a lot of people
without mercy…
219
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,430
Even innocent children.
220
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,710
If things continue like this,
we’ll be sucked into the tributary…
221
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,350
What should we do?!
222
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,360
Ninja Art: Link and Slay.
223
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,980
What the heck?!
224
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,210
Wh-What is this?
225
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,590
Th-The ship’s been sliced in half…
226
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,460
Naruto!
227
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,930
Naruto!
228
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
You jerk!
229
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,340
It’s them! The Ninja Dropouts!
230
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,550
So they showed up after all…
231
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,550
Gantetsu…
232
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Reinforcements, huh?!
233
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,860
Hey, who are you guys anyway!
234
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,570
The head of the Ninja Dropouts,
Shura, on the scene!
235
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,300
Ninja Dropouts…
236
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,540
We’ll take Gantetsu…
237
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,540
I’m not about to let that happen!
238
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,560
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
239
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,770
Will always be smiling right near by
240
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,540
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it
241
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,250
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape
242
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,190
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,
243
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,020
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds
244
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,960
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,
245
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,370
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away
246
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,670
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future
247
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:15,180
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling
248
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,050
The wind is probably testing our hearts
249
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,390
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
250
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,560
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears
251
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,400
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands
252
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,000
The Key to the rusted heart’s door
253
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,170
Will always be smiling right near by
254
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,380
Lee, are you all right?
255
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,890
Yes, somehow.
More importantly, what happened?
256
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,990
I don’t know.
257
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,220
Only thing I know is that after
that huge crash,
258
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,760
suddenly the ship was sliced in two…
259
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,830
I see.
260
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,790
Well then, we need to confirm everyone’s
safety for the moment…
261
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,930
Well…
262
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,500
What’s wrong, Sakura?
263
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,240
I can’t find the prisoner, Gantetsu,
Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.
264
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,110
Next time:
“The Bewildering Forest”
//%
1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,590
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,510
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,050
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,590
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,300
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:46,180
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:55,590
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:06,430
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:15,760
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,930
What were you gazing at?
11
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,760
– Where… 					– Where…
12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,890
– Where…am I? 					– Where…am I?
13
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,510
Remembrance:  The Lost Page
14
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,470
All right! I’m up for it today again,
believe it!
15
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,800
However… There haven’t been
any flashy missions around here lately.
16
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,010
C’mon! It’s unbelievable, right?!
17
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,590
Yeah well…
18
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,760
Lately, I’m dead tired from doing
nothing but training.
19
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,550
Sakura!
20
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,590
Naruto!
21
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,930
There’s someone who got
too much time on his hands!
22
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,180
What’s that?! Speak for yourself.
23
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,470
No matter how I look at it,
you are just helping the shop.
24
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,300
What happened to Shikamaru
and Choji?
25
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,470
On a mission with Asuma Sensei!
26
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,260
Oh, I wanted to go on a mission too!
27
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,260
While Ino was down with a cold,
everyone went on urgent missions.
28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,350
And now I’m completely recovered!
29
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,890
What am I going to do with
all my fighting spirit?
30
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,590
Why don’t you use that fighting spirit
in some training?
31
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,800
That’s what you think!
32
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,220
In my family, if you don’t have
a training partner,
33
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,850
then they make up some reason
for you to help out with the shop!
34
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,590
They must know that if you’re alone
you’ll skip training, eh?
35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,760
H-Hey! Don't say something that
could hurt a person’s reputation!
36
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,140
I do it properly by myself.
37
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,550
Naruto…
38
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,760
Stop it, Shino! Don’t surprise me!
39
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,010
Naruto Uzumaki… Yamanaka Ino…
40
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,430
The Hokage is asking
for both of you.
41
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,590
What? Me too?
42
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,050
By the way, I’ve also been ordered to go,
along with you guys.
43
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,850
– Huh? 					– Huh?
44
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,800
Ino… me and Shino?
45
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,590
Huh?
46
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,800
Demon of Ocean causing disturbance…?
47
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,590
Yes, literally a demon in the ocean.
48
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,470
It seems to be the cause of the disturbance
happening in the remote Land of Sea…
49
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,720
What’s wrong…?
50
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,140
You’ll go for me, won’t you?
51
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,720
Of course.
52
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,430
Shizune…
53
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,590
Y-Yes!
54
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,680
Explain…
55
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,350
Y-Yes!
56
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,010
As you can see,
57
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,590
the Land of Sea is made up of
a group of islands of various sizes.
58
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,800
Recently in that area, their only means
of transportation, ships,
59
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,140
are being attacked and robbed
of money and valuables.
60
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,590
The people on the boat who
were victimized
61
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,720
unanimously claim that the damage
was done by the “Demon of the Ocean.”
62
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,590
And exterminating this Demon
of the Ocean is the mission?
63
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,590
Well… more or less, yes.
But there’s more.
64
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,590
The Land of Sea does not have
a hidden village of its own,
65
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,390
so they’re prepared for contingencies
66
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,930
through military cooperation with
the neighboring country, the Land of Water,
67
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,930
and have been paying them
a retainer every month…
68
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,390
However, the other day,
one of their ships that collects funds
69
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,550
was attacked by
the Demon of the Ocean as well…
70
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,590
I see. To preserve their relationship
with Land of Water,
71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,890
Land of Sea will do anything
to protect the next ship.
72
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,390
Yes… This mission is to guard
the ships collecting funds
73
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,590
and destroy the Demon of the Ocean…
74
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,590
I’ve got a few people to work under you,
so I’m counting on you.
75
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,550
Work under me… ?
76
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,220
Enter!
77
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,930
Huh?
78
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,590
The Chunin Exam’s…
79
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,800
Th-That scary proctor!
80
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,600
Oh, you’re bringing back memories..!
81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,600
A-Anko Mitarashi Sensei?
82
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,220
Why are you here?
83
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,350
– Everyone! 					– Yes!
84
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,430
I’m pronouncing your mission!
85
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,550
Shino Aburame!
lno Yamanaka!
86
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,720
Naruto Uzumaki!
87
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,140
The three of you will work under Anko
and accompany her on a mission!
88
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,140
What?! These members?
89
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,590
The team is pretty disjointed, isn’t it?!
90
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,930
No use talking about it!
91
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,390
Listen... I’ve thought through
the matter and
92
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,430
I believe that this combination is
93
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,180
the most qualified for this mission…
94
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,970
All of you display your own capabilities
to the full extent and execute this mission!
95
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,300
– Yes! 					– Yes!
96
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,800
She just gathered the available Genin…
Really, she is such a…
97
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,720
Still, something doesn’t feel quite right…
98
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,300
Yeah, yeah, no complaints about
a mission that’s settled!
99
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,590
Ouuch… I got it!
100
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,300
Okay, we’ll depart right away!
101
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,220
Everyone prepare and assemble
at the front gate!
102
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,100
– Roger! 					– Roger!
103
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,100
Oh, ouch!
104
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,470
Anko…
105
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,180
Be careful…
106
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,590
Yes…
107
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,800
Characteristics of
the Demon of the Ocean...
108
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,600
It’s like a fish, like a person...
What is this?!
109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,590
Huh, someone’s eyes are playing tricks.
Something like that can’t exist!
110
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,260
Not true, it’s possible that Ex-Ninja
become pirates
111
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,930
and use Transformation and Genjutsu.
112
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,930
Well, whatever, if we don’t gather
information, there will be no solution.
113
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,760
Right…
114
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,180
Mother Island is the biggest island
at the center of Land of Sea…
115
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,640
We’ll go to a nearby fishing port
and cross over by boat!
116
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,390
– I understand!
– I understand!
117
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,430
Yeah! Let’s depart for the Land of Sea!
118
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,760
This guy is always hyper…
119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,590
I'm anxious about what’s going to happen.
120
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,300
Here you are…
121
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,590
Um… Lady Tsunade…
122
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,590
Hmm?
123
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,890
It’s about…Anko Mitarashi just now…
124
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,590
Did, uh…
Did something happen in the past?
125
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,180
Sort of…
126
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,590
Oh? This is…
127
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,260
Her record of missions from about
the age of ten is pretty sporadic.
128
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,600
Because Anko was under Orochimaru...
129
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,470
So the parts that are blacked out
130
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,430
are combined
with Orochimaru’s movements…
131
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,720
and in the confidential file?
132
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,590
Part of them are…
133
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,300
Huh?
134
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,720
There are some parts
that aren’t recorded…
135
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,100
That’s the truth.
136
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,510
No record?! Even though
Anko herself was in the village?
137
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,300
That Orochimaru…
138
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,550
It seems he really didn’t
want to be traced…
139
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,390
When he left the village…
140
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,970
He erased part of Anko’s memories.
141
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,600
The wind is salty…
142
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,590
Coming this far, we can already
see over the Land of Sea.
143
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,010
Then, that must be the Mother Island?
144
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,600
What ? What is this feeling?
145
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,180
Everyone… Sorry but…
146
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,050
Go ahead and take care
of the arrangements for the boat.
147
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,720
What? But, what would you do, Sensei?
148
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,590
I’ll take care of some business
and join you… See you!
149
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,220
Oh! Sensei?!
150
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,590
C’mon, it can’t be helped…
151
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,590
What are you doing, Shino?
152
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,010
We’ll leave you behind!
153
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,180
Yeah…
154
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,590
The Curse Mark aches.
155
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,590
This presence… No question about it.
156
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,800
This way?
157
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,970
I can say their names
without a problem!
158
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,260
Um… That’s Mother Island…
159
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,590
These are Taro Island and Jiro island.
160
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,470
And… That there’s Demon Island!
161
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,390
Seems you prepared before you came…
162
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,430
I want to become a wiser, stronger
Shinobi like you, Master Orochimaru…
163
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,050
Oh…?
164
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,800
Here.
165
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,680
Sorry, but I can’t give you anything
more than this.
166
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,430
What’s up…lno?
167
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,640
Hey, mister!
168
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,260
Aren’t you bringing prices down
way too much?
169
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,220
That’s high-quality fish, isn’t it?
170
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,590
Oh dear…
171
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,590
I’m not price-cutting…
172
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,590
See...
173
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,430
Because of that
"Demon of the Ocean"  uproar,
174
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,390
customers are completely staying away...
175
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,180
This is the market price around here.
176
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,510
Really? That fish is rarely…
Oh!
177
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,890
What’s with her appearance?
ls she injured or something?
178
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,430
No… That girl, she has her reasons.
179
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,930
Well…
180
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,180
She’s a female diver from a small town
on the cape of Mother Island…
181
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,890
What?!
182
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,720
Why would a woman diver on
Mother Island transfer islands on purpose?
183
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,970
That’s because, the island people
didn’t want to do business with her…
184
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,850
That girl…
185
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,100
In the past, she was spirited away…
186
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,550
Spirited away…?
187
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,680
A person suddenly disappears…
is that it?
188
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,220
That’s right!
189
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,470
In the past,
190
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,350
a lot of island people disappeared
from being spirited away.
191
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,590
The story is that out of all those people
192
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,890
that girl was the only one
who suddenly returned one day.
193
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,680
Hey, hey!
194
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,720
It’s a little village…
195
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,010
So everyone felt creepy.
196
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,720
They say that now, she lives alone
outside of the village…
197
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,050
I see… I feel sorry for her.
198
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,220
With her appearance...
And then you hear things, I too...
199
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,720
feel a little bit creepy…
200
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
That's true.
201
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,590
Hey, where’s Naruto?
202
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,590
I don’t know…
203
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,850
Hey! What are you guys doing?!
204
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,390
Oh no!
205
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,680
Hey, are you okay?
206
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes…
207
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,140
You’re uh… You’re from a place called
Mother Island, aren’t you?
208
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,140
Hm?
209
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,510
Uh… Nothing…
210
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,550
Ninja…
211
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,720
Oh, I’ll help!
212
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,590
That’s okay…
213
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,390
Huh…? H-Hey… Wait.
214
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,590
What the…?
215
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,800
It’s too bad but, the last boat from
the port has already left.
216
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,590
But the sun hasn’t even set yet…
217
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,930
Around here, there’s nobody who
will take you across in the early evening...
218
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,850
Sorry, but come back tomorrow.
219
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,590
No way…
220
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,590
Well, is there a way to get to
Mother Island besides the ferry?
221
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,550
Mmm, I can’t really advise it, but…
222
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,220
If it’s necessary,
I’ll let you borrow my little boat.
223
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,890
Hey! I was looking all over for you guys!
224
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,510
C’mon! Where were you?!
225
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,850
Sorry, sorry…
226
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,350
You should at least say something
before you disappear.
227
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,590
You and Sensei are exactly alike,
suddenly going someplace.
228
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,350
Feels like there’ll be
a bumpy road ahead.
229
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,050
What?! That’s rude.
230
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,590
Placing me in the same category together
with that unreasonable sensei--!
231
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,600
Who’s what?
232
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,180
S-Sorry.
233
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,550
This sensei… is dangerous, after all…
234
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,260
Good work procuring the boat!
235
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,430
S-Sensei… Where in the world
have you been all this time?
236
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,970
Oh, something like
gathering information…
237
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,590
Well, let’s go!
238
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,260
The Shinobi of Leaf Village are here…
239
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,640
Land of Sea must have
pleaded with them
240
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,100
to investigate on
the “Demon of the Ocean.”
241
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,390
Well then, we should give them
the best welcome.
242
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,930
It’s getting dark…
243
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,590
We’re almost to Mother Island.
244
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,510
All right, all right!
245
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,850
Full speed advance to Mother Island!
246
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,590
Although the sun has already set ...
247
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,390
Where does all your hyper-energy
come from?!
248
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,220
Times like this,
your state of mind is important!
249
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,680
Sakura sure has her share of trouble…
I feel sorry for her.
250
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,510
What the…!
I ran up against a rock or something!
251
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,680
Hang in there, Naruto!
252
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,100
Hey, all of you look forward, front!
253
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,550
Dodge it, quick!
254
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,760
You say that, but…
255
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,590
It’s no good, the oar won’t move!
256
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,510
I’ll help!
257
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,970
You…!
258
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,590
Striking Shadow Snake!
259
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,350
Naruto! Leave it!
260
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,050
I understand!
261
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,300
To show themself so soon…
262
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,890
That was close…
263
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,590
The two of you be careful!
He’s aiming at us from underwater!
264
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,550
Dammit!
265
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,430
Demon of the Ocean or whatever,
266
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,850
an underwater creature for
an underwater battle!
267
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,510
Summoning Jutsu!
268
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,970
I’m counting on you… Chief Toad!
269
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,590
What?!
270
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,100
Hey! Naruto!
What kind of place did you call me to?!
271
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,180
Why did you come out!
You stupid frog!
272
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,590
Oh! Hey, wait!
273
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,680
Summoning Jutsu.
274
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,720
Please come out, Chief Toad!
275
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,220
Hey, good evening!
276
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,550
It can't be!
I have been calling for Chief Toad!
277
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,300
Stupid! If you summoned
the old man to a place like this,
278
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,640
terrible things would happen.
279
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,800
Huh? Why?
280
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,640
We’re freshwater creatures!
We don’t go with saltwater!
281
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,510
I don’t like salty things either.
282
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,050
You’re no help at all!
283
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,640
Shino! Take care of Ino…
284
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,600
Okay!
285
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,590
All right!
286
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,590
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!
287
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,430
Water Clone?!
288
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,180
You let your guard down!
289
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,760
You did too!
290
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,600
Take that!
291
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,850
There was one more?!
292
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,590
What the…? My body strength is…!
293
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,800
How is it?
My improved skill of Chakra Suction?
294
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,390
What’s happening?!
295
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,140
Where did he go? Damn it!
296
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,600
My visibility is too bad…
297
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,470
Hey, pull yourself together, Naruto!
298
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,970
Big Brother, it itches.
299
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,930
Ah, I’m at my limit, too…
300
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,510
B-Big Brother!
301
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,470
This is not so good.
302
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,640
Naruto!
303
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,590
What happened?
304
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,760
You two are?!
305
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,510
I’ll discharge all the Chakra
I absorbed at once…
306
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,590
Water Style: Furious Current Jutsu!
307
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,590
Shoot! I can’t approach them
so easily with this.
308
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,050
Naruto…
309
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,010
I can’t stand this!
310
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,300
The wind blows, Ah…
311
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,050
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
312
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,590
What should be brought along?
313
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,590
Assemble them into a piece.
314
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,640
There is no second chance, never
315
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,350
How foolish it is to throw away
316
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,590
Acting so innocently, Ah…
317
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,510
The images.
318
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,590
It probably will not end
319
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,850
It probably will not end
320
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,600
Burn that love-filled heart,
321
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,680
Sail across a thousand dreams
322
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,720
Running freely
323
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,510
To take hold of the world in hand
324
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,590
The clouds scatter
325
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,590
The sun sets yet again
326
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,100
The solo parade begins to move.
327
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,430
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
328
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,800
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
329
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,590
To think the departure of
the collection ship
330
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,890
would be moved up
at the time like this.
331
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,970
It can’t be helped.
332
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,430
We’ve got to find Naruto somehow
by tomorrow morning.
333
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,680
I hope we pick up some information about
the Demon of the Ocean along the way.
334
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,350
The search range is quite expansive, huh?
335
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,260
It’d be best to split up.
336
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,430
Then I’ll go from the south,
you guys take the north.
337
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,510
– Roger! 					– Roger!
338
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,800
Think about what happened yesterday.
339
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,600
Each of you, tackle this with care. Scatter!
340
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,010
Next time: “The Closed Door”
//%
1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,660
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:29,490
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,870
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,040
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,200
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:52,750
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,620
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,660
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,910
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:18,580
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:28,540
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,750
Sasuke!
13
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,080
Are you going to
run away from me?!
14
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,080
Yo…loser.
15
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,490
A Cry on Deaf Ears
16
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,870
It’s you this time, huh?
17
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,790
I couldn’t do it.
I was not able to stop Sasuke…
18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,830
I think…
the one who can stop Sasuke…
19
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,490
the one who can save Sasuke is…
20
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,620
Naruto…you are the only one.
21
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,290
Naruto…this is my…
once in a lifetime…favor to ask…
22
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,490
Please… Please bring Sasuke back!
23
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,200
I also told this to Sakura, but…
24
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,490
Don’t mind me anymore.
25
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
What's with that face?
26
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,080
Iruka Sensei, why on the earth
does an outstanding person like me
27
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,490
have to be on the same team with him?
28
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,490
Sasuke graduated with
the highest grade out of all students…
29
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,120
Naruto, you are at the bottom!
30
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,410
When you even out
the team’s strength,
31
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,910
then it naturally becomes like this.
32
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,160
Try your best not to slow me down,
you dunce.
33
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,660
I am fine without eating!
I am absolutely fine.
34
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,950
I’m…fine…
35
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,910
Here.
36
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,660
You asked Sakura for a hint the other day,
what did she tell you?
37
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,620
Shall we go?
38
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,330
Yup.
39
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,700
Wh-What’s with that face…?
40
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,490
You loser…
41
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,620
Why…?
42
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,700
You… I hated you, you know.
43
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,120
It’s none of your business!
44
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,160
Who knows,
my body moved on its own.
45
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,490
You rescue Sakura, no matter what!
46
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,830
Sasuke… You…
47
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,200
I could still distract him for a little while…
48
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,000
I lost everything once.
49
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:06,040
I don’t want to see my precious comrades
die in front of me anymore.
50
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Why…?
51
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,290
Why is it…Sasuke?
52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,950
Why did you become like this?!
53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,700
You!
54
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,450
Whatever happens to me,
what does that have to do with you?
55
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,120
I have my own way.
56
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,580
No matter who it is,
57
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,540
nobody has the right
to tell me what to do.
58
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,160
I will tell you the truth.
59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,490
I’m done fooling around with
you guys of the Leaf.
60
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:56,950
Go home.
61
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,080
I’ll take care of him!
62
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,490
Choji…
63
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,910
Go everyone!
64
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,620
Go, quickly! I’ll catch up with you.
65
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,700
Neji…
66
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,950
Okay!
67
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,750
Hold on!
68
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,290
Kiba…
69
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,870
Kiba! Akamaru!
70
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,500
Now! Naruto!
71
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,490
Shikamaru…
72
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,660
The strategy…a success!
73
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,250
What are you doing?
Please go quickly!
74
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,660
You also promised Sakura
with a Nice-Guy pose, Naruto.
75
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,450
Bushy Brow…
76
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,620
I’ll defeat this person.
77
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,750
It’s a promise.
78
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,490
Everyone…
79
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,950
Everyone risked their lives
to come after you, you know!
80
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,910
Good job for them.
81
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,290
Lastly, I will tell you
the most important thing.
82
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,250
Sasuke is neither a close friend
of mine nor is he someone I like.
83
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,580
But Sasuke is a Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
84
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,410
A comrade.
85
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,500
That’s why we will rescue him
by risking our lives.
86
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,120
This is the Leaf way.
87
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,330
How do you take
your comrades of the Leaf ?!
88
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,000
Comrades, you said…
89
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,950
Did I become stronger staying
with those so-called comrades?
90
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,450
I am going to where Orochimaru is.
91
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
Orochimaru is the person who killed
the Third Hokage
92
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,620
and tried to crush The Leaf Village!
93
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,620
Do you think he will
give you the power freely?
94
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,490
He just wants your body
as a vessel!
95
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,620
You might not be able to come back.
You might get killed.
96
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
You think I’d easily let you
go to such a place?!
97
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
That doesn’t matter to me…
98
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,250
If my goal is accomplished,
then that’s all that matters.
99
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,290
If you intend to get in that way…
100
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,910
Then it can’t be helped…
101
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,290
You’re not gonna be able to!
I’ll take you back even by force!
102
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,410
Why are you laughing?!
103
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,950
You were laughing at that time too.
104
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,790
That time…?
105
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,700
What’s funny?
106
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,160
It’s not funny. I am happy.
107
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,620
Thinking about…
how I can finally defeat you here.
108
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,620
That time you wanted to fight me, right?
109
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,160
You were thrilled weren’t you?
110
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,580
At first!
111
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,950
But, you were different.
112
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,870
That was…
113
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,870
Hurry up and come.
114
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,200
But first, put on your Headband.
I’ll wait.
115
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,490
I don’t need such a thing…
116
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,490
Just put it on!
117
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,540
You won’t be able to
put one scratch on my face.
118
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,160
That’s not it!
119
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,910
I’m saying that this is a sign
that we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.
120
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,040
That is what I call a stuck up!
121
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,500
You think you and I are equal?
122
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,490
Yeah, I think so.
123
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,330
I’ve never thought I was inferior to you.
124
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,410
You’re so obnoxious!
125
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,790
Stop!
126
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,870
That was…
127
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,450
That was not the kind of fight I wanted.
128
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,500
Even now…this is not…
129
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,580
I don’t care about
your circumstances.
130
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,950
What…is this power?
131
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,370
Power is flowing out…
132
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,080
So this is the power that
the guy was talking about.
133
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,200
Furthermore, the power
is growing into my body.
134
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,490
If it is like that now…
if I release this curse mark…
135
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,500
I wonder how much power…
136
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,750
Wh-What power…
137
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,290
He’s not the same as before…
138
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,040
Wake up already!
139
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,290
I awakened long ago…
140
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,490
From my idiotic self who dreams about
a lax peaceful future…
141
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,750
hanging out with comrades.
142
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,410
That’s why I left the village!
143
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,040
That’s why I sought power!
144
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,490
My dream is not in the future.
145
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,490
My dream is in the past…
146
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,040
That’s the only place it exists.
147
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,490
Wow, Brother!
148
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,490
You hit the target right in the middle,
even the one behind the rock!
149
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,500
All right, me too!
150
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,370
Sasuke, let’s go home.
151
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,490
Geez… You said that
you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.
152
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,500
There is an important mission tomorrow
and I need to prepare for that.
153
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,490
Liar…
154
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,490
Forgive me, Sasuke…
Another time.
155
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,500
Brother, watch me!
156
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,950
Hey! If you push yourself…
157
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,490
Why is the one who twisted
his ankle laughing?
158
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,490
Could it be that you are trying
to take the easy way?
159
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,120
That’s not true...
160
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,490
I’m happy thinking about
161
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,200
how I’m finally going to
the Academy starting tomorrow.
162
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,500
I’m going to do my best
when I enter the Academy.
163
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,870
So even that father will approve of me.
164
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,540
He will count on me
like he does on my brother…
165
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,490
Sasuke… You really are…
166
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,950
I told you…
167
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,950
I don’t need a future
with you guys anymore.
168
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,000
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.
169
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,040
For the first time, I spoke to you
170
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,160
And you smiled
171
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,580
For the first time, I was able to speak
172
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,490
In my own words
173
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,120
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?
174
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,540
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage
175
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,370
My clumsy attempts with words
176
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,040
You listened without turning away
177
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,330
No wonder I get carried away by you
178
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:11,410
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
179
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,490
I feel so sad
180
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,490
But…
181
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,950
For the first time, I spoke to you
182
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And you smiled
183
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,660
For the first time, I was able to speak
184
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,750
In my own words
185
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,370
For the first time, I spoke to you
186
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,490
And you smiled
187
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,040
For the first time, I was able to speak
188
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,000
In my own words
189
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,540
For the first time, I spoke to you
190
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,700
I feel power surging
through my body…
191
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,750
It's as though I can't lose.
192
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,490
It's power I'd never have gained
playing comrade with you guys from Leaf.
193
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,580
But it's not enough.
lt's way short of enough, Naruto!
194
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,490
Strength…hatred…and desire!
195
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,450
Next episode:
"Brothers: Distance Among the Uchiha"
//%
1
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,200
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,250
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,990
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,540
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,040
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:45,990
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,370
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:06,160
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:15,750
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,910
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,990
The Dark Creeping Clouds
12
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,540
Come…come…come…
13
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,000
The villagers are welcoming us.
14
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,200
Everyone seems to be safe.
15
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,200
It seems like the Kurosuki Family
ran away in fear.
16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,290
Hey…
17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,200
Here they come!
18
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,290
Naruto! Don’t come…
19
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,990
If you value your life,
be quiet.
20
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,580
Karashi…
21
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,370
I heard that you were deeply sorry
for your actions…!
22
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,540
How could I shamelessly
run back to the curry house?!
23
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,250
Now!
24
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,250
Did you see that?!
25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,990
Although Master Raiga is not around,
the Kurosuki Family is eternal!
26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,540
Hey…what are you looking for?
27
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,910
Isn’t it obvious? The brats!
28
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,990
Are you referring to us?
29
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,750
What?!
30
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,950
What you crushed were our forms
31
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,990
made by the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.
32
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,990
Take formation!
33
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,950
Ninja Art: Black Tornado!
34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,000
Wha--?
35
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,990
Those were also made by
36
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,990
the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu!
37
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,750
We saw through everything!
38
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,990
Here I go.
39
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,910
Leaf Hurricane!
40
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,290
Disperse!
41
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,990
Byakugan!
42
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,990
2 palms! 4 palms!
43
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,950
8 palms!
44
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,990
16 palms!
45
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,750
32 palms!
46
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,950
8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
47
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,290
Here I come!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
48
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,990
Clone Spinning Axe Kick!
49
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,950
Huh?! Oww…
50
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,000
It’s already over…
51
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,990
What?! Not fair!
52
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,500
Man! You could’ve saved
some for me!
53
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,990
Just when I thought
I’d try the new Jutsu!
54
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,500
Gosh, you never learn, do you!
55
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,200
Karashi, are you prepared?
56
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,330
I was just kidding!
57
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,990
How dare you torment us!
58
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,990
You really think
we’ll let this slide as a joke?
59
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,870
I couldn’t help it! If I didn’t listen,
60
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,290
I would have gotten killed
by the Kurosuki family.
61
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,580
In place of the Kurosuki family,
62
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,080
I’ll crack your head
with this hammer!
63
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,990
Yeah! Yeah!
64
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,870
I’m sorry…
65
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,250
Please move, Lee!
66
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,990
Please hit me until
you guys are satisfied.
67
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,370
Why you?
68
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,450
It’s partly my responsibility
69
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,870
that the once kind-hearted Karashi
went and joined a gang.
70
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,000
Yours?
71
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,790
Because of me,
72
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,990
he got the impression
that power is everything.
73
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,080
Right, that’s right!
74
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,750
Though I knew that it’s a bad thing,
I just had to…
75
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,990
You be quiet!
76
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,080
Karashi is still inexperienced.
77
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,700
But he has skills to make curry
that can save people’s lives.
78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,790
Please give Karashi the opportunity
to make amends by making curry.
79
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,990
If Karashi goes astray again,
then I will…!
80
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,990
Punish him with my fists!
81
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,370
Everyone, what do you think
82
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,080
about letting Lee and Grandma Sansho
take care of this situation…
83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,160
After all, he was just
an underling of the Kurosuki family.
84
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,700
It’s not like he directly
attacked us or anything…
85
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,660
Let’s have Lee educate him harshly…
86
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,790
In that case…
87
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,450
Thank you very much!
88
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,580
Th-Thank you…
89
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,660
And with this, our mission is complete.
90
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,330
No, not yet…
91
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,990
Huh?
92
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,290
Are you all right?
93
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,290
What’s the point of being all right?
94
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,080
I can’t live alone.
95
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,580
Don’t say that!
96
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,620
Why don’t we just
leave this weakling!
97
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,160
Everyone has to live alone!
98
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,990
But don’t you need friends
who can help you and stuff…?
99
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,500
I’m talking about some basics!
I hate people who are indecisive!
100
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,120
I was frail
from the time I was born.
101
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,990
That shabby cabin was
the entire world for me.
102
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,990
I have no memory of my parents…
103
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,540
I survived only by
the small amount of food
104
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,450
that the villagers sometimes
brought me…
105
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,990
But even someone like me
had a power that no one else did.
106
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,830
Here you go.
107
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,200
Thank you…
108
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,370
Is your leg okay?
The one you cut with the scythe?
109
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,990
D-Did I tell you that story?!
110
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,830
No…I kind of found out…
111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,950
How? No one else besides me
came today or yesterday, right?
112
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,790
No, I just saw it from here…
113
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,080
Scary!
114
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,700
As time went by everyone began
to fear me since I had the power
115
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,990
to know what was happening outside
even from my room.
116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,160
Did you know?!
117
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,370
I heard that Ranmaru has
the ability to see everything…
118
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,370
Were we being spied on every day?
119
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,750
Get out of the village!
120
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,410
You monster!
121
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,990
And so I had no more visitors…
122
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,990
All I could do was to wait to die.
123
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,580
That’s when Raiga saved me…
124
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,120
I see. What a bitter past.
125
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,080
Yes, it is.
126
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,990
Hmm…
127
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,200
Raiga took me out to
the unknown world.
128
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,000
Ranmaru, try opening your eyes…
129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,580
This is the outside world where
we’ll be living from now on…okay?
130
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:39,990
Okay…
131
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,250
If Raiga isn’t here,
it’s the same as losing my body.
131.01	01:36:52:09	01:36:54:13	Perhaps Raiga became known
132
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,660
as one of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist
133
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,910
because he was able
to borrow your power.
134
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,990
It seems like you two
helped each other to live…
135
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,250
Yes.
136
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,500
That’s not true!
137
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,990
You were being used for
Raiga’s evil deeds!
138
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,200
I might have been…used…
139
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,870
But good or bad doesn’t matter to me.
I’m just a sense organ…
140
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,990
Then that won’t mean
that you’re really living!
141
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,990
Huh?
142
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,500
See, you have to do your best
to live from now on!
143
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,990
Firstly, eat the curry of life
and cheer up!
144
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,580
That’s right!
You will get nourishment.
145
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,540
That will hurt the body instead,
wouldn’t it?
146
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,990
Naruto, you can’t eat it either, right?
147
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,160
Actually, the more I eat it,
148
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,500
the more energized my body feels…
149
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,990
That curry saved my life, you know!
150
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,790
Until the day you’re able
to walk alone,
151
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,790
I will become your body!
152
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,410
Okay?
153
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,620
I have one favor to ask…
154
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,330
Huh…?
155
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,250
Byakugan!
156
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,990
As I expected…
I can no longer see life in Raiga.
157
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,700
Can you see, Ranmaru?
158
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,290
Yes.
159
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,700
Is this okay?
160
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,580
Yes…
161
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,580
Let’s go… Mission is complete.
162
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,990
Hey!
163
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,450
What?
164
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,580
That is--!
165
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,990
One, two, one, two.
166
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,830
Grandma Sansho!
167
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,990
What’s all this ruckus?!
Dust will go into the curry.
168
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,040
L-Lee and the others came back!
169
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,660
K-Karashi is with them!
170
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,830
Is it worth the ruckus?
171
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,540
Grandma, aren’t you happy?
172
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,370
One, two… One, two…
173
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,580
Your snot will go in!
174
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,580
Grandma Sansho! I’m back!
175
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,080
Karashi is here too!
176
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,990
M-Mom, sorry!
Please forgive me!
177
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,450
Please forgive him…
178
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,990
He says he’ll devote himself
from now on,
179
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,910
and train to take over
the Curry of Life Shop, so please…
180
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,750
First you gotta eat…
181
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,540
Huh…
182
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,790
Wow, it looks good!
183
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,500
If you’re not going to eat, I will!
184
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,990
I’ve prepared some for each of you…
185
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,160
Oh my, that’s a very pale child.
186
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,580
Yeah, can you prepare
some for him too?
187
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,080
Especially mild…
188
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,040
I prefer mild too…
189
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,910
Oh my…
190
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,330
Mom…thanks for the food!
191
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,250
It’s a punishment times 300 curry…
192
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,990
It’s spicy, it’s spicy…
193
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,830
But it’s good! It’s good, Mom!
194
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,990
Here, I have some for everybody!
195
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,120
It’s okay, it’s mild.
196
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,990
By the way, you were part of
197
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,200
the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist with Raiga, right?
198
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,410
Do you know a guy
named Zabuza?
199
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,250
Zabuza…you say?
200
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,250
Uh then…
201
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,620
How about a guy with this huge sword
wrapped with something like a bandage
202
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,950
and has fish eyes?
203
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,790
Oh…that’s Kisame…
204
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,790
Yeah Kisame!
205
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,160
So, do you know what
he’s up to right now?
206
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,870
No… I heard that he slipped out
from the Mist Village.
207
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,370
I know his face, but I don’t know
anything beyond that.
208
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,000
I see…
209
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,580
Should I ask Grandma to
make you something else?
210
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,120
No, I don’t need it…
I don’t want to eat anything.
211
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,580
Thank you for your help…
212
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,370
Thank you very much.
213
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,200
Make a good village with everyone!
214
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,830
Um…where is Lee?
215
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,990
His mission still isn’t complete.
216
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,990
Please wait, Lee… I’m gonna die!
217
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay, let’s take a break here!
218
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,200
Let’s do 300 push ups.
219
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,990
What?!
220
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:12,040
One, two…One, two…
221
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,370
300…all right.
222
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,370
It looks like…
there’s going to be a storm.
223
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,410
Even if a real storm comes,
224
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,750
it should be fine if we reinforce it
with these big trees!
225
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,870
Oh my, thanks for doing this.
226
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,250
No, it’s our thanks for the curry.
227
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,660
Uh-uuh.
228
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,540
But compared to you guys,
my Karashi is…
229
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,040
Tenten? I’m worried about
Karashi and Ranmaru
230
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,040
whom we left behind
at the curry shop.
231
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,410
We’re okay,
so could you check on them there?
232
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,290
Karashi?!
233
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,000
Hey…
234
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,910
Is the Boss really still alive?
235
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,990
That Neji person didn’t seem
to sense it then…
236
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,990
But I know.
237
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,330
Raiga…
238
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,370
Oh…
239
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,870
You were everything to me!
240
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,250
I was only waiting to die…
241
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,160
when you told me that
we’ll live on together!
242
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,990
To me, being with you, was living…
243
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,790
I won’t hold a funeral for you either.
244
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,870
Even if it costs me my life,
I won’t let you die!
245
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,990
Ranmaru!
246
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,990
Did you die, Ranmaru?!
247
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,700
Karashi…?
248
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:41,290
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
249
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:52,990
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
250
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:04,200
What dreams did you chase to get here?
251
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:16,410
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
252
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:27,950
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
253
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:39,370
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
254
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,080
I’ll be close to you
255
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,990
What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?!
256
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,540
Then we gotta go save her
right away!
257
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,120
Please calm down! Naruto!
258
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,080
Tenten can’t be that clumsy.
259
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,910
Huh? But that’s what Karashi said.
260
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,580
Unfortunately, this might be
some kind of trap.
261
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,990
What? Trap?
262
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Karashi…
263
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, didn’t they get annihilated?
264
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,160

We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,980
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,600
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,600
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,600
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,270
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,100
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:44,400
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:51,770
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,060
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,650
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,270
– Good-bye, Sensei.
– Yay! School's out!
21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,480
Good-bye, Iruka Sensei!
22
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,890
Good-bye!
23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,480
Make sure you practice what
I taught you today, Transform Jutsu!
24
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,690
And tell your family about tomorrow’s
inauguration for the Fifth Hokage!
25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,400
– Okay! 					– Okay.
26
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Konohamaru!
27
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,940
What is it, Iruka Sensei?
28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,560
Well…it’s all right.
29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,400
See you tomorrow!
30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,940
Okay… Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!
31
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,060
It looks like he got over it.
32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Hey, Lee!
33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,980
On your way back from rehabilitation?
34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,100
Um…yes…
35
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,230
I hope you get better soon.
36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,650
Thank you very much.
37
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,900
To activate each and
every cell all at once…
38
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,980
If it were just one by one,
it’d be a snap,
39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,980
but all of them together
is gonna be tough.
40
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,310
Still…
41
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,440
The Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now,
42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,770
so we must do our best!
43
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,890
I think if you had Lady Tsunade take
a look, you'd get better very quickly.
44
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,890
It's better that you give up being
a Shinobi and look for a different path.
45
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,150
Sensei and Student:
The Bond of the Shinobi
46
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,600
Clone Jutsu!
47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,900
Transformation Jutsu!
48
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,270
Hey, young kid…
49
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,520
The medal of youth is one of passion,
with no looking back!
50
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,440
If you work hard at it,
51
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,310
I’m telling you, son,
you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!
52
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,230
Who is he?
He is pretty overbearing.
53
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,980
Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth…
54
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,940
Well then, adieu.
55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,520
That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.
56
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,100
And then…
57
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,900
Today, you have all become Genin.
58
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,690
I want to hear what
your goals are for the future.
59
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,190
I don’t want to answer.
60
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,810
I-I…!
61
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,190
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja,
62
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,650
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
63
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,230
That would be the ultimate for me!
64
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,810
Those are good serious eyes…
65
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,730
You! What's so funny?!
66
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,150
I'm serious!
67
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,270
I will become a respectable Ninja
even only with Taijutsu!
68
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,060
Don’t you realize that
if you can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,
69
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,890
you’re not a Ninja in the first place?
70
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,060
Don’t you remember being told
that you’re the first person
71
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,440
to graduate from the academy
who’s only able to use Taijutsu ?
72
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,690
It’s not because you’re so good;
it’s just that you’re unusual.
73
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,560
W-Why--!
74
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,400
Listen up! If you have passion,
it’s not necessarily so.
75
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,690
If you act with passion,
76
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,560
compete with good rivals
and lift each other up,
77
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,730
you can all become great Ninja!
78
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,150
But you know,
you have to work hard!
79
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,890
Passion…
80
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,350
I…was inspired by Guy Sensei.
81
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,100
By his words…and his deeds.
82
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,770
You’re late!
17 minutes and 32 seconds late!
83
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,890
Let’s not do it today, all right?
84
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,890
Each of us has 48 wins!
85
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,650
With a win today,
one of us will pull ahead!
86
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,060
I guess you won't give up
even if I say I wouldn’t want to do it.
87
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,890
It’s my turn to choose the event, right?
88
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,900
Right! What’s it gonna be?
89
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,520
A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash?
90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,940
Holding our breath under water?
91
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,020
I don’t care, we could even
have an eating contest…
92
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,850
Please…
93
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,900
Okay, then…
94
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,020
Wh-What?!
95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,690
Rock, paper, scissors!
96
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,690
Rock, paper, scissors?
That’s what you choose?
97
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,190
They say that your luck is
one part of your skill, don’t they?
98
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,890
Plus, it’s a great competition
for testing your observational reflexes…
99
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,060
R-Right.
100
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,690
Do you get the feeling
Kakashi’s just playing around with Guy
101
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,350
‘cuz he can't be bothered?
102
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,900
That’s what it looks like to me.
103
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,600
I accept the battle.
There’s no way I’m gonna lose!
104
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,600
If I do, I’ll walk around the Leaf Village
500 times on my hands!
105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,890
There you go again…
106
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,890
I promise!
107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Here we go…
108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,020
Another one of your special,
self-imposed rules.
109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,060
He can’t do that.
110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,940
That’s ridiculous.
He’s acting like a kid.
111
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,060
Yeah, that’s impossible,
even for Guy Sensei.
112
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,100
Impossible? Reckless, I’d say!
113
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,810
– Rock, paper…!
– Rock, paper…!
114
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,810
Here you are.
115
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,190
Guy Sensei?
116
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,230
How did you know I was here?
117
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,850
I know everything about you.
118
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,230
I heard that you skipped out
on rehabilitation these past two days?
119
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,690
You can’t be doing that!
120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,100
When I first became Genin…
121
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,850
this is where I revealed
my dream, my aspiration.
122
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,890
Neji laughed at me then,
but I meant what I said.
123
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,190
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja
124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,650
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
125
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,400
That would be the ultimate for me!
126
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,020
At that time, you told me…
127
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,810
If you act with passion,
compete with rivals,
128
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,890
you can become a fine Ninja.
129
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,940
And that…
130
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,730
In order to do that, it’d take “effort.”
131
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,980
I was happy to hear that.
132
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,890
– Transform! 					– Transform!
133
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,730
Because while at the academy…
134
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,400
no one, not one friend or teacher,
said that kind of thing to me.
135
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,980
You put me at ease…
136
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,890
You opened up a path
just when I was unsure of myself.
137
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,890
I realized all I had to do
was try my best.
138
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,890
And when I complained that
139
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,020
all my efforts couldn’t match
the others’ natural talents,
140
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,400
you told me that I had
a natural talent for effort.
141
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,940
That was when I learned the importance
of believing in my own strength.
142
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,890
The chance of a successful surgery
is probably 50%, at best.
143
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,810
But…this is one time…
even if I try my best…!
144
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,150
and even if I believe in myself,
there’s nothing in the world I can do!
145
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,600
Guy Sensei… Please tell me…!
146
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,350
Please tell me.
Can I become like you?
147
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,150
Why did this kind of thing
happen only to me?
148
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,890
Because I have my own
Way of Ninja to follow,
149
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,480
my own dreams and aspirations
that I have to protect and
150
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,890
prove to the world even
if it means dying for…
151
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,600
What should I do?!
152
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,890
The Eight Inner Gates…
153
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,900
Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that
will destroy the body of the practitioner?
154
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,270
Please tell me!
155
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,770
I’m prepared for the worst.
156
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,900
Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!
157
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,890
Everything is…for my dream!
158
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,230
That means everything to me!
159
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,940
You tried to become a great Ninja
relying only on Taijutsu…
160
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,230
Until now, that’s all you had.
161
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,890
It must be so painful for you…
162
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,890
Now that it seems that your dreams
163
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,270
and all your wishes
are being cruelly taken away.
164
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,850
It does not matter what his wishes are,
he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.
165
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,650
Lee…
166
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,850
If you want to be free of that pain,
you have to prepare yourself!
167
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,770
Does it mean…
to prepare to give up my dreams?
168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,230
If you lose your dreams,
169
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,810
you will undergo pain even greater
than what you feel now.
170
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,190
Neither you nor I would be able to
go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
171
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,890
What fools we are…
172
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,810
Lee! Have the surgery!
173
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,890
How’s it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?
174
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,060
It’s all about the Chakra, but…
175
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,100
There are so many kinds of cells…
176
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,060
skin cells, internal organ cells,
muscular cells…
177
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,890
You know, it’s just a tad difficult
to activate all of them at once.
178
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,810
What’s that?
“Just a tad,” you say?
179
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,730
Are you testing me?
180
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,890
Oh no!
181
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,890
I’m declaring my trust in you.
182
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,890
I don’t know why,
but just a while ago…
183
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,810
I was remembering the time
when you and Kakashi Sensei
184
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,690
were competing
with rock, paper, scissors.
185
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,060
At that time, Kakashi Sensei said
186
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,020
that your luck is
one part of your skill, right?
187
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,940
This surgery is also fifty-fifty,
live or die…
188
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,890
But…
189
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,270
it’s not a game of
rock, paper, scissors!
190
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,150
Do you remember what happened
after that, Lee?
191
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,100
500 times around…
lt’s a promise! Yay!
192
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,730
What's he doing?!
193
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,730
Shoot!
194
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,440
If I lose, I’ll walk 500 times
around the Leaf Village, on my hands!
195
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,890
It's a promise!
196
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,310
He can’t do that! That’s stupid.
He’s acting like a kid.
197
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,310
Hah! This is nothing!
198
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,980
Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?
199
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,890
Why are you doing this?
200
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,690
Kakashi Sensei is not here.
ln fact, no one is watching.
201
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,230
When a man stands cool with
a Nice-guy pose in front of others,
202
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,350
he should keep his promise,
even if it kills him!
203
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,980
It’s a promise!
204
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,270
What?
205
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,270
Why do you always do that?
206
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,890
Whenever you’re about to start
doing something,
207
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,560
why do you always come up
with some kind of crazy rule.
208
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,890
Good question, Lee.
209
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,730
You really know how
to get to the point.
210
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,060
OK, I’ll tell you.
But remember, you can’t tell anyone else.
211
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,890
What’s the answer?
212
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,890
Making self-rules is nothing less than
a practice which brings me victory!
213
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,400
S-Self-rules…?
214
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,810
Are you ready?
215
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,440
The point of these rules is that,
when you’re going after something,
216
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,440
they push you into a real tough spot…
217
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,730
It’s about chaining yourself down.
218
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,770
For example, on the other side
of the hellish rule that
219
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,520
“If I lose at rock, scissors, paper,
I’ll do 500 laps” is the idea that
220
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,890
“If I do 500 laps,
221
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,900
there’s no way I won’t be able
to beat Kakashi next time.”
222
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,890
They hold power,
the potential of the heavens.
223
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,270
Y-Yes…
224
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,480
By being chained down
to doing 500 laps,
225
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,770
it makes you get serious.
226
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,900
Even about things like
rock, paper, scissors competitions,
227
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,810
which are so trifling otherwise.
228
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,100
And, even if you lose,
walking around the village 500 times
229
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,350
give you the benefit
of extremely intense training.
230
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,890
I see!
231
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,400
OK, I’ve gotta do a little more.
Here we go!
232
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,810
I’m going with you!
I have my own “self-rule” which is--
233
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,890
Hey! Hey! Don’t push yourself, Lee.
234
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,890
If I can’t keep up with you, I'll…
235
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,150
try even harder!
236
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,890
That is, I’ll aim to be like you.
237
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,690
And if I keep trying,
I’ll be able to become a great Ninja!
238
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,810
All right! If that’s the case,
then I have an addition to my rule!
239
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,690
If you can’t keep up with me
all the way to the end…
240
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,100
I’ll put every ounce of
my being into training you!
241
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,190
If I train you with all my being,
you’ll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!
242
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,270
I promise!
243
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,190
Huh, that’s right.
244
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,940
That was the first time you told me about
the "self-rule," wasn’t it?
245
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,600
Your surgery will be a success
246
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,400
because you have worked hard
all the way through.
247
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,270
You have the power to bring
your own future in the heavens.
248
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,440
And in the one in a thousand…
249
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,890
no, one in a million chance
that something goes wrong…
250
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,650
I will die with you!
251
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,900
Ever since I met you,
252
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,810
my Way of Ninja has been to
nurture you into a fine Ninja.
253
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,890
I promise you!
254
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,850
Neither you nor I would be able
to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
255
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,400
What fools we are…
256
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,810
G-Guy Sensei!
257
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,480
OK, let’s go, Lee!
258
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,850
Yes, sir!
259
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,150
Lady Tsunade!
260
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,600
From this day forward,
261
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,690
I am the ruler of the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!
262
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,270
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
263
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,770
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
264
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,890
On your still shoulder
265
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,560
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
266
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:44,060
The city lights are like pieces of stars
267
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,890
That hold us together
268
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:58,690
“Each one of us glows differently,”
269
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,350
you say laughingly
270
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,230
but you look most dazzling
271
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,150
Like a comet,
272
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:18,350
like the rainbow after the storm
273
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,560
You bring light into my heart
274
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:35,890
Being lost can be the answer
275
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:44,850
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
276
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,890
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
277
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,520
Darn! He has no hole
in his defense.
278
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,310
Being impatient won't
do any good, Naruto.
279
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,890
Let's utilize the next mission.
280
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,440
That's right. The next mission
requires an overnight stay.
281
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,890
– Our chance will be at the inn.
– Roger that!
282
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,480
Once we get to the inn,
we'll wait until he's defenseless…
283
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,190
– and then… 					– and then…
284
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,940
– unmask him at once!
– unmask him at once!
285
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,770
Next time: "Gotta See! Gotta Know!
Kakashi Sensei's True Face!"
286
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,890
'Cuz we're really curious!
//%
1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,060
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,270
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,440
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,150
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,890
Shikamaru always believed in me…
13
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,100
More than myself or Neji or
any of us here… He is stronger!
14
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,690
Let’s go, fatso!
15
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,520
Don’t YOU say that!
16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,560
Partial Expansion Jutsu...
17
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,900
Arm!
18
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,770
Partial Expansion Jutsu...
19
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,940
Leg!
20
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,810
Partial Expansion Jutsu...
21
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,350
Arm!
22
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,890
Don’t mess with me! Scum!
23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,190
Eat this!
24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,150
What!
25
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,560
Super Expansion Jutsu!
26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,560
Good-bye Old Friend!
I’ll Always Believe in You!
27
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,650
I did it…Shikamaru…
28
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:17,890
What?!
29
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,060
I can’t believe I had to get to
the second state
30
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,890
for an opponent like this one…
31
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,890
Slamming Palm
32
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,150
What…What is that appearance?!
33
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,310
Now that it’s come to this, it’s over.
34
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,890
In the second state, I can put out ten times
more power than I have thus far.
35
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,400
I’m invincible.
36
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,650
It’s too painful to move…
37
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,020
Who knew that the side effects
of the Curry Pill would be this intense.
38
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,890
This is what happens…
39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,810
to a powerless scum for butting in!
40
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,560
Playing Ninja better suits you!
41
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,230
Raise your hand if you’re playing Ninja.
42
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,190
Wait…
43
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,520
Rock, paper…scissors!
44
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,190
Split!
45
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,980
One, two, three…
46
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,890
W-Wait!
47
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,850
99…100!
48
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,890
Hey! I said, split!
49
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,810
Ouch!
50
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,480
Found you!
51
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,440
Give up quietly, the two of you!
52
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,600
We finally caught ‘em!
53
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,270
I’m sick of this!
The team with Choji always loses!
54
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,850
Sorry…
55
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,310
I need a lot of Chakra
for this "second state."
56
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,520
I’ll take whatever Chakra
you have left!
57
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,890
Well then, I’ll take them now.
58
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,890
There’s not much left…
59
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,730
You’re empty!
60
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,480
I haven’t had nearly enough to eat…
61
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,900
I said I haven’t had enough to eat!
62
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,480
Huh…?
63
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,890
What, just one last piece, huh…
64
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,600
When I said I haven’t had
enough to eat…
65
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,350
Just as I thought, you’re the scum
used as a sacrificial pawn.
66
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,060
Die…you pitiful fatso, the odd man out.
67
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,810
I won’t let you play Ninja with us!
68
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,810
Why?
69
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,020
Because if we let you play,
we’ll lose.
70
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,850
You’re slow.
71
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,350
Yeah, but…then the number
of people won’t be even.
72
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,890
Japanese chess is fun
because the number of pieces are even.
73
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,890
A piece that is useless is
the same as not having that piece!
74
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,350
Yeah, that’s right!
75
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,940
We’re the ones with fewer people
and we’re not complaining.
76
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,270
Hurry up, let’s do it!
77
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,890
if it’s okay with you, then it’s fine…
78
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,890
Okay, it’s settled!
79
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,730
We can win it!
80
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,100
Yes!
81
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,100
Where are we gonna hide this time?
82
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,770
And um, the whole Akimichi Clan
is fat and slow…
83
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,060
That’s what everyone says.
84
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,230
Really...
85
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,690
But Choji, you’re a kindhearted guy…
more than everyone else.
86
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,150
One day, you’ll surely make friends
who’ll see that quality of yours.
87
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,730
And then you should cherish
those friends
88
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,350
and be the kind of friends
who believe in each other…
89
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,890
Can I really make…friends like that…
someone like me…?
90
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,230
Rest in peace…
91
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,770
you’re not the only one
I’m going to get.
92
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,600
After I kill you,
93
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,940
I’m going to get the cruel, sleazy,
mean guys who used you as a sacrifice!
94
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,350
Because he…promised…
95
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,770
You better catch up with us…Choji.
96
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,890
Okay!
97
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,650
He’s definitely going to defeat
the opponent and come after us…!
98
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,730
Yep!
99
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,480
That’s right…he can do it.
100
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,890
Okay! While I’m here…
101
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,890
Me too…
102
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,350
All right, everyone,
103
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,270
we get Sasuke back
before Choji catches up!
104
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,770
Wait!
105
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,190
All right! Here we come!
106
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,810
He’s late…that Jirobo…
107
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,520
He’s greedy and eats so much…
108
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,810
He’s probably squeezing out Chakra
even from the marrow of their bones.
109
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,850
I wish he had switched
with me already…
110
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,440
Here, I’ll give it back!
111
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,850
Well, then…
112
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,520
If I linger,
I won’t be able to catch up.
113
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,890
It’s about time to put an end to this.
114
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,150
The Chili Pepper Pill is left…
115
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,890
But…if I take that…
I’ll die, without a doubt…
116
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,890
Don’t you dare die, Choji…
117
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,890
We’ve been doing things together
since that day…
118
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,890
Oh…! You…
119
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,650
You…were there just now…
120
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,020
What about playing Ninja?
121
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,770
It was a drag,
so I pulled myself out from it.
122
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,310
Huh…?
123
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,350
By the way, that’s my special seat.
124
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,020
Your special seat?
125
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,520
I like to lie on my back and
look at the clouds on a nice day like this.
126
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
You’ve come to look at clouds?
127
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,890
Mind if I sit there?
128
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,890
Oh…sure!
129
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,400
This is a good place.
You can see the clouds well.
130
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,690
Yeah…
131
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,270
Why don’t you…
132
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,020
What…?
133
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,890
watch the clouds with me
and lounge around?
134
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,560
Okay!
135
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,230
You know! I-I brought snacks.
Want some?
136
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,520
Oh, that’d be great!
137
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,730
Thanks.
138
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,810
Eating potato chips
while watching clouds…this is the best.
139
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,730
Yep!
140
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,730
My name is Shikamaru…
from the Nara Clan.
141
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,890
You… What’s your name?
142
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,690
It’s Choji! Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan!
143
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,810
Choji, huh…
I think I’ll get along with you.
144
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,980
Me, too!
145
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,890
We’ll always do things together
from now on, too.
146
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,890
Choji…!
147
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,270
Shikamaru… Sorry…I can’t go…
148
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,850
It’s over…
149
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,060
But, this guy…
150
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,730
I have to beat him…
even if it means death.
151
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,890
No matter what you do now,
it’s too late!
152
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,980
Crushing Palm!
153
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,310
Wh-What’s that…?
154
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,940
But…
155
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,690
Boulder Blow!
156
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,230
It’s no good!
157
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,560
I’m 100 times stronger than before!
158
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,890
They say that food
can be a reason
159
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,890
for people to hold a horrible grudge
against somebody.
160
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,020
The blow just now…
was for eating the last bite of my snack…
161
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,560
No way!
162
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,230
This guy has so much Chakra that
his body has changed physically!
163
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,560
And this is…
164
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,310
for making fun of me by calling me
a sacrificial pawn and fat!
165
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,890
But what I can’t forgive you for
more than anything else …
166
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,650
You sure do suffer when
you have a stupid leader. You underlings!
167
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,900
Well… I’ll kill you losers
168
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,810
before you suffer working
under a glum shadow lover like him!
169
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,310
You should blame your stupid leader
for choosing you!
170
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,690
You insulted my best friend!
171
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:05,060
More than mocking me
by calling me fat,
172
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,020
and poaching the last bite
of a four-star meal…
173
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,190
I can’t forgive you for that!
174
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,900
All of my Chakra…to my left hand!
175
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,900
Uh, uh-oh…!
176
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,060
This blow…is heavier than my life!
177
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,600
W-Wait…! Don’t be hasty…!
178
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,520
I…I won.
179
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,190
Me… I won!
180
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,890
Everyone…
181
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,850
But Choji…
182
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,770
you’re a kindhearted guy,
more than everyone else…
183
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,400
One day, you’ll surely make friends
who’ll see that part of you…
184
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,230
And then you should cherish
those friends
185
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,890
and be the kind of friends
who believe in each other.
186
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,060
“Hurry up and get over here.”
lt’s Naruto.
187
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,890
“Everyone’s waiting.” 					Kiba…
188
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,020
Shikamaru…
189
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,900
Ino-Shika-Cho!
190
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,900
Even if it is just potato chips,
191
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,060
I won't let anybody else have
the last piece, no matter who you are.
192
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,730
Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,
193
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,150
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.
194
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,900
Dad…
195
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,940
I’ve made…a lot of friends…
196
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,890
What happened?
197
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,940
Nothin’…
198
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,650
Once in a long while, once in a while
199
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,230
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
200
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,520
Look like a mountain
201
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:53,890
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
202
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:59,400
The remnants of a person crying
203
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,440
Look like a mountain
204
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,100
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
205
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,940
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
206
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,270
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
207
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,520
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
208
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,850
Look like a mountain
209
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,890
Look like a mountain
210
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,600
Look like a mountain
211
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,890
Look like a mountain
212
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,020
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
213
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Take this!
214
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,150
Fang Over Fang!
215
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,900
Byakugan!
216
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,190
That damn spider bastard!
217
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,480
Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji.
Our careful planning is not working!
218
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,100
If we dawdle Sasuke will be gone!
219
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,650
Hey, what should we do?!
220
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,940
If we want to continue our pursuit,
there’s only one way to do it!
221
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,770
Next time: “Your Opponent is Me!”
//%
1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,850
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,650
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,770
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,060
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,600
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,230
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,850
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,270
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,890
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,890
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,480
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,890
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,940
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:19,890
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,810
So it’s a case of not being able to fight
with the leader
16
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,480
unless I defeat the underlings?
17
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,810
Well then!
18
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,900
Hot-Blooded Confrontation:
Student vs. Sensei
19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,890
So you think you’ve blackened the path
to this Might Guy’s tomorrow with this?
20
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,690
Youth is breaking through
the walls that close you in…
21
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,890
If you have both passion and effort,
then nothing is impossible!
22
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,520
With our sights trained on tomorrow…!
23
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,190
Is there no tomorrow for us…?
24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,890
So this wood retains
its incredible strength
25
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,100
because it is reinforced and
connected by Chakra, I see.
26
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,230
Guy Sensei…
27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,770
Yagura?
28
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,060
Are you all right?!
29
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,060
I’m not Yagura…
30
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,480
Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers,
Gensho!
31
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,850
Second son of the same, Rokkaku!
32
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,270
Third son, Jako!
33
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,270
Ryudouin?
34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,850
Hmm… I think I’ve heard
of that somewhere…
35
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,600
Don’t tell me that you don’t remember!
36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,900
Our father, Agira Ryudouin,
was deeply injured
37
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,480
by the cowardly strategies of you
Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
38
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,480
And unable to execute his missions,
he passed away in despair.
39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,890
Our father resented you to the very end,
40
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,890
even muttering your name
on his deathbed…
41
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,890
telling us to fight with
Might Guy of Hidden Leaf Village.
42
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,230
From that day forth,
43
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,230
our objective
has been to avenge his death!
44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,890
Yes! We have been lying in wait for
the time when we could get even with you!
45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,350
Oh! Do you mean that Agira?!
46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,440
There’s no way I could forget that battle.
47
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,850
Although we were enemies
on our missions, Agira was a fine man…
48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,850
That will remain in my memory as
a splendid contest, even within
49
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,850
the annals of
the complete eight-volume
50
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,350
“Might Guy’s History of Famous Battles.”
51
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,310
It was a man-to-man fight.
52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,230
Nothing happened that dishonored
my Way of Ninja!
53
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,890
You three must be mistaken.
54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,890
I won’t be angry at you,
so let me out of here!
55
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,900
Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon
you to settle my father’s score…
56
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,650
I’ll finish you off!
57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Sakura…
58
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,270
I noticed you were there some time ago.
59
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,400
My master told me to
make sure you don’t overdo it.
60
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,600
You’re hiding something, aren’t you?!
61
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,310
N-No… Nothing!
62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Sakura, you’re not very good at lying…
63
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,850
What?
64
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,940
Die, Might Guy!
Enemy of our father!
65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,850
Wait, I tell you!
66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,890
Hey, you Yagura imposter.
lnfiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves,
67
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,730
what are you scheming?!
68
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,890
Byakugan!
69
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,940
Guy is in that building!
The building is controlled by their Chakra!
70
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,770
Why you--!
71
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,690
Intense Brow Sensei,
I’m coming to your rescue!
72
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,940
Wh-What is this?!
73
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,940
Do you intend to shut us in
with these pieces of wood?
74
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,270
Don’t underestimate us!
75
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,060
Stop it, Naruto!
76
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,890
Wooden Dummies for training?
77
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,560
Are these also controlled by those three?
78
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,400
However strong they are,
79
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,230
they couldn’t move all of
these Wooden Dummies at once.
80
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,190
It’s hard to believe those three would
have that much power.
81
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,150
Byakugan!
82
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,400
I see.
83
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,150
They have a simple mechanism,
84
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,480
and their movements are controlled by
the labels stuck to the back of their heads.
85
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,890
So, they’re not moved with Puppet Jutsu?
86
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,890
No, they’re only designed for
repeated punches and kicks,
87
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,980
so they probably cannot respond
to our movements!
88
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,890
Does this mean their movements
can be halted by removing the labels?
89
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,770
So that’s what it’s all about!
90
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,400
If that’s the case,
then I’ll return that blow!
91
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,810
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
92
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,230
Here goes!
93
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,350
Once I know the weak spot,
you’re all mine!
94
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,150
– Gotcha! 					– Gotcha!
95
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,980
Hah! This is easy!
96
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,890
These Wooden Dummies are
just one small part of our Jutsu!
97
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,890
Ninja Art:
Wooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu!
98
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,650
Damn you!
99
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,900
Keep your wits about you!
100
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,890
There’s one that moves differently
from the others!
101
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,850
Neji!
102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,900
U-zu-ma-ki…
103
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,890
Naruto Barra--!
104
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,100
Stay back!
105
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,650
Some of these Wooden Dummies seem
to be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu.
106
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,890
Be careful!
107
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,480
– Lee! 					– Bushy Brow!
108
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,480
Leaf Hurricane!
109
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,890
Lee?!
110
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,100
How did you know we were here?!
111
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,890
From what Sakura told us,
112
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,100
I felt certain that Guy Sensei
would take this route
113
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,810
if he were headed for
the Land of Mountain Streams.
114
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,190
And where is Guy Sensei?
115
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,850
Inside there.
116
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,890
What?
117
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,270
A-Are they running away?
118
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,890
What’s happening?!
119
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,270
It’s just like a castle!
120
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,020
Leave this to me!
121
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,100
Guy Sensei is my master!
I would risk my life to save him!
122
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,980
But, Bushy Brow,
your leg injury hasn’t healed yet.
123
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,890
I’m going in!
124
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,440
It’s reckless!
125
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,230
Do you intend to interfere?
126
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,890
Today, I am just
a bit different from usual--!
127
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,310
Bushy Brow, we’ll cover you.
128
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,400
There is a weak point in
the Chakra at the center of the castle.
129
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,850
If you hit there, then…
130
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,890
But it may be a trap!
131
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,650
Everyone… If it is a trap,
let’s try falling into it intentionally.
132
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,690
Over there!
133
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,770
Dynamic Entry!
134
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,770
As we suspected,
it was a trap to lure me in.
135
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,100
Anyway, let’s follow it through.
136
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,890
Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me.
137
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,310
All right.
138
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,940
Take revenge on that coward
by a suitable method.
139
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,600
Leave it to me…
140
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,980
Wooden Dummy: Possess:
Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
141
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,400
A Wooden Dummy here too?
142
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,650
Your teacher is an incredible liar, Lee…
143
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,020
Is that Yagura’s voice I hear?
144
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,980
I’ll teach you both,
master and student,
145
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,310
that sometimes passion and
effort alone come to naught.
146
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,890
I won’t allow you to
speak ill of my teacher.
147
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,980
If you’ve got something to say,
148
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,850
then why don’t you come out here
and say it?
149
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,400
There is no need.
150
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,940
I can amply prove it with
the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation.
151
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,520
I have come to rescue my teacher!
152
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,440
There’s no way
I’m going to let myself lose to you!
153
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,730
You make me laugh…
154
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,730
What’s this? The Leaf Hurricane…?
155
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,270
Does this mean that the technique
I deployed that time
156
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,940
has been completely imitated
and mastered by Yagura?!
157
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,890
In that case…
158
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,150
Leaf's Severe Hurricane!
159
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,900
Can this really be Yagura?
160
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,890
If he’s mastered not
only offensive moves,
161
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,480
but also learned to guard with
such perfection
162
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,400
then he truly must be a genius!
163
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,890
What an incredibly
powerful spinning kick…
164
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,400
The Gensho I faced off with
in the practice hall
165
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,890
did not have this much power.
166
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,810
To my knowledge,
167
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,310
there is only one person who
could let loose this powerful a kick.
168
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,270
They are student and teacher
who respect each other.
169
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,230
Dying in fighting each other must
be a wish come true.
170
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,730
We’ll have them crush each other
171
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,890
with Wooden Dummies mimicking
each other’s movements.
172
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,270
Even if each were to discover
the true identity of his opponent…
173
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,190
They can’t escape from the confrontation
174
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,770
without defeating
the Wooden Dummies before their eyes.
175
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,890
That is the secret of
176
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,520
Wooden Dummy: Possess:
Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
177
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Looks like my legs
can’t last for very long…
178
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,100
If it comes to this,
there’s only one move left.
179
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,270
Guy Sensei, it’s okay right?
180
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,890
If I use it for your sake,
you’ll probably forgive me.
181
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,060
The Lotus?
182
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,730
Could it be that the one who is controlling
this Wooden Dummy is Lee?
183
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,150
Dancing Leaf Shadow!
184
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,020
A combo move from the Lotus Hit Back
to aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
185
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,890
It’s magnificent…
Too magnificent!
186
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,400
Only Guy Sensei could use
such artful techniques!
187
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,940
Splendid! If I had not been his opponent,
188
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,190
I’m 100% certain that he would have
toppled the opponent with that Lotus.
189
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,650
But, at this rate,
I won’t be able to beat this Jutsu…
190
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,400
Wait! There is a way.
191
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,480
That tapping is Morse Code.
“You and I are destroying each other…”
192
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,310
But there’s no way for either
of us to end this fight
193
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,890
without defeating the enemy’s Jutsu…
194
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,690
So, it was Guy Sensei that
I was fighting all along?
195
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,890
We must both create an attack
with speed and power
196
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,230
of a magnitude that cannot be
reproduced by the Wooden Dummies…
197
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,310
“But I cannot show to you
the abyss of death again!”
198
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,730
Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person
who is most important to me…
199
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,890
“You will forgive me for using
that move, won’t you?
200
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,890
"To me…" 					"To me…"
201
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,940
“To me, there is no one more important
than Guy Sensei,” you say?
202
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,890
Lee! What do you mean by
making me cry at a time like this?
203
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,890
Lee! I haven’t forgotten the promise
I made to you back then!
204
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,980
“If you die…I shall die with you.”
205
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,980
Thank you, Guy Sensei!
206
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,650
Now is the very time when…
207
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
one’s own Way of Ninja…
208
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,270
– must be followed to the very end!
– must be followed to the very end!
209
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,690
Third Gate: Gate of Life… Open!
210
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,060
Fourth Gate: Gate of Pain… Open!
211
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,850
Guy Sensei!
212
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,890
We’re far from finished!
213
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,520
What’s wrong, Elder Brother?
214
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,730
They’re fast. They’re both too fast…
215
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,890
At this rate,
the Wooden Dummies will…break.
216
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,230
Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing!
217
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,100
Open!
218
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,890
I can’t see them.
They’re faster even than sound!
219
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,150
There you go, Lee!
220
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,810
Bring the Chakra of your passions
to bear upon your opponent!
221
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,890
Right!
222
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,350
– The castle is…
– …crumbling?
223
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,900
If this was revenge,
224
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,770
then why did you not come at me
with the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin?
225
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,650
That day, though he was
the only man left,
226
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,890
your father refused to surrender,
227
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,890
but fairly and sportingly confronted me
with Kung Fu.
228
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,890
Out of respect to your father,
I faced him one to one.
229
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,310
When the fight was finished,
your father smiled slightly,
230
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,890
as if satisfied, and said he would like
to fight again…
231
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,520
Whether or not you believe me,
this is all there was to it.
232
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,520
Could it be that
what Father wanted to say
233
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,440
was not that he wanted us
to defeat Master Guy,
234
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,890
but that he wanted to fight again,
fairly and squarely?
235
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,230
Have we had the wrong idea all along?
236
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,520
I learned something important from
your father in that fight.
237
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,940
It is not the people born with
natural gifts who are the lucky ones;
238
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,890
the truly fortunate are they who,
believing in themselves to the very end,
239
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,980
can go on striving and keep the flame
of their passions alive because of it.
240
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,400
Uh-huh.
That’s a good teacher-student relationship.
241
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,900
Naruto!
242
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,560
Say, Sakura! Hurry up and get
Bushy Brow to Grandma’s place, will you?
243
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,310
Got it! Get him to the stretcher.
244
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,020
No, don’t worry about me.
I’m okay. See to Yagura first.
245
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,890
Speaking of which,
I still haven’t asked of Yagura’s real name.
246
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,600
Lee, there’ll be plenty of tim
for that later.
247
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,190
Administering first-aid
should take priority.
248
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,650
Yes! Guy Sensei!
249
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,350
Yup, yup… That is really one
super teacher-student relationship.
250
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,890
I wish mine was as good…
251
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,190
On a checkerboard night
252
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,810
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
253
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,190
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
254
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,350
Suggestively
255
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,100
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
256
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,890
The Trombone gradually going off-key
257
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:12,400
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
258
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,440
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
259
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,650
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
260
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,100
Yo, Kiba, Neji!
261
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,890
As always, you have
no sense for tension.
262
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,890
– What was that?!
– Be quiet, you guys.
263
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,020
That’s right. They are about to
give us important instructions.
264
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,350
– Okay…
– Choji too! Can't you eat a little later?
265
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,850
– I don’t mind.
– That’s not the point at all!
266
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,890
N-Naruto… Um… I…
267
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,440
Things are heating up in here,
aren't they, Sakura?
268
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,350
You are getting too excited.
269
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,350
Hey. We’re all here.
270
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,890
Then, I’ll explain the next mission.
271
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,890
Next time:
“Crisis: The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather!”
//%
1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,850
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,650
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,770
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,060
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,600
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,230
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,850
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,270
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,890
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,890
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,480
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,890
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,940
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:19,890
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,560
Reunion: The Remaining Time
16
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,600
What’s going to happen?!
17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,890
What’s the deal?!
18
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,350
Sumaru’s mom is being
pressed back!
19
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,980
My star training is
done my own way.
20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,850
It shouldn’t be a match
21
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,890
for one who has completed
proper star training like you.
22
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,350
But what’s with that sorry state…?
23
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,890
I can’t feel even a smidgeon
of the power from before.
24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,890
Sure enough, you’ve also got
side-effects from the star training…
25
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,480
Even if this life should end…
26
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,650
I’ll never forgive you!
27
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,770
Lord Akahoshi!
28
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,020
What?
29
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,890
You be a good boy!
30
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,770
It’s a simple mission.
31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,150
We’ll be able to come back home
right away.
32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,890
Right! Have a safe journey.
33
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,560
Mother!
34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,600
Mother!
35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,890
Mother!
36
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,020
Sumaru…!
37
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,730
Mother!
38
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,940
Sumaru!
39
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,060
Oh, no!
40
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,190
Lord Akahoshi.
Why would you do such a thing?
41
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,890
Is it true then…?
42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,650
Give it back…
43
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,150
Hold it!
44
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,890
Farewell.
45
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,350
Wh-What?
46
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,190
Then it was Lord Akahoshi
47
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,020
who knocked everyone out
and took Sumaru away?
48
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,520
A sensei who does something
like that
49
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,100
to students who believe in him
is unforgivable!
50
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,770
Why in the world…?
Why would you do such a thing?
51
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,650
It’s all for the sake of the village…
52
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,350
It’s for the sake of taking back
the star she stole!
53
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,770
Even if that were the case,
54
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,230
that doesn’t make for a reason
to cause Sumaru pain!
55
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,900
That person is Sumaru’s mom!
56
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,060
M-My…mother…
57
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,480
Exactly!
58
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,810
However, even if she is your mother,
she’s now your enemy!
59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,060
The person before you is
the woman who stole the star
60
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,020
and attempted to bring about
the doom to our village!
61
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,850
That’s wrong!
62
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,480
Sumaru’s mom just hid the star
63
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,600
in order to save everyone from
the pain of the training!
64
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,730
Foolishness! Being able to die
for the sake of the village
65
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,230
is a Shinobi’s long-cherished dream!
66
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,890
Isn’t that right, Sumaru?!
67
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,520
You’re going to become the Hoshikage
and put to shame
68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,850
the Five Great Hidden Villages
that treated us with contempt, right?
69
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Yes… I want to become the Hoshikage
and put them to shame…
70
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,270
Show your foolish mother
your determination!
71
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,350
Yes… I can die if it’s for
the sake of the village.
72
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,350
Sumaru!
73
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,520
Don’t do anything stupid, Sumaru!
74
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,890
His Chakra is in synch with Akahoshi’s.
75
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,020
Sumaru is being controlled!
76
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,100
What?!
77
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,400
Exactly… I have Sumaru’s life
in the palm of my hand.
78
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,100
Lady Natsuhi.
79
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,730
I shall give you the ultimate choice!
80
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,890
Will you take the star?
81
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,850
Or…your son’s life?
82
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,810
Wait!
83
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,890
What’s the matter, Lady Natsuhi?
84
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,890
Have you realized
your own foolishness?
85
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,890
Lady…
86
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,230
You win, Akahoshi.
87
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,770
Sumaru!
88
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,190
You did it!
89
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,890
Excellent. How did you get it?
90
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,850
Simple, Lady Natsuhi returned it
with good grace.
91
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,890
Lady!
92
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,150
That’s dirty!
93
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,850
Sumaru!
94
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,890
Sumaru…
95
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,890
Is that person…really…?
96
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,890
What’re you doing?!
97
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,230
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
98
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,650
– You…! I won’t forgive you!
– You…! I won’t forgive you!
99
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,560
Hidden Leaf Shinobi,
I’m your employer.
100
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,440
– That doesn’t make any difference!
– That doesn’t make any difference!
101
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,810
Wait, Naruto!
102
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,060
Neji!
103
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,810
Why, Neji? I can’t stand this either.
104
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,650
No! From here on is an issue
for the Hidden Star.
105
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,100
It’s none of our concern!
106
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,650
That being said, are we just going
to leave them be?
107
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,980
Anything further would be beyond
the scope of the mission…
108
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,100
The Leaf must not betray the client
of the accepted mission, right?
109
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,020
Damn it!
110
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Oh well.
111
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,190
The star has returned.
I’ll overlook everyone’s actions today.
112
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,650
Those who wish to continue to live
for the sake of the village, come with me…
113
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,270
B-But…Sumaru is…
114
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,770
Forsake the son of the traitor.
115
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,020
Pull out!
116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,100
Yes, my lord!
117
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,020
I’m sorry. I must not leave
Sumaru behind.
118
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,600
Rogue Ninja!
119
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,940
Hokuto! You’ll regret this!
120
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,350
Well, do as you like!
121
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,150
That jerk…!
122
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,890
Hey, look…!
123
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,890
It’s called Natsuboshi.
124
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,560
It’s the other name for
the planet Mars, right?
125
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,890
It seems it’s the same name
as Sumaru’s mom…
126
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,020
Sumaru thinks that star
is protecting him.
127
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,890
I bet Lady Natsuhi was also
looking at that star.
128
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,480
I’m moved.
129
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,900
The hearts of parent and child
are connected!
130
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,940
Yeah…
131
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,020
How’re the two doing?
132
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,020
They’re resting comfortably now…
133
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,060
But Akahoshi attack
the mother took
134
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,770
when her body was weakened
from the effects of the star is a fatal one.
135
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,310
Her Chakra Network is in shreds
and it will mean certain death
136
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,770
if she uses that Jutsu
even one more time…
137
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,890
Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade could…
138
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,770
Who knows…?
139
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,890
Damn it! That Akahoshi jerk
is unforgivable!
140
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,100
I’ll kick his butt!
141
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,310
Naruto…! You still don’t get it?
142
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,890
But he’s a huge scoundrel.
143
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,270
That’s right!
144
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,060
The Leaf would lose credibility
145
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,890
if we do something like betraying a client.
146
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,100
But we can’t leave things be, right?
147
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,060
Well, I also understand what
Neji’s saying.
148
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,980
We must ask the Lady Hokage
for instructions.
149
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,770
That’s right.
150
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,900
Anyway, let’s take those two to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
151
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,980
Yeah… The Hidden Star matter
will come after that.
152
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,890
Sumaru.
153
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,890
Mother!
154
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,600
Mother.
155
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,190
You’re probably angry,
aren’t you, Sumaru…?
156
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,060
Of course, you would resent me…
who abandoned the village
157
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,980
and went so far as to entrust you
to someone else.
158
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,690
How often I attempted to take you
with me…
159
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,400
But I kept telling myself that
160
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I couldn’t make you happy since
I had become a Rogue Ninja…
161
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,770
with this body that could
give out at any time
162
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,890
due to the star training.
163
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,730
Stay away!
164
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,560
I often had the same dream.
165
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,850
A dream where I chase
after you two, crying.
166
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Sumaru.
167
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,600
Mother!
168
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,150
I kept telling myself
169
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,310
that my mother was not
a cold-hearted person
170
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,690
who would leave me behind…
171
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,520
You had died.
172
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,940
Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said.
173
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,520
He said you had been killed by
a Ninja from some other land,
174
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,890
died and turned into a star…
175
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,730
He said you had turned
into the Natsuhiboshi…!
176
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,560
Sumaru…
177
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,890
Mother!
178
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,400
Even so…
179
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,190
Even so…I wanted you to
take me with you.
180
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,890
Sumaru…
181
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,690
I was lonesome… Mother…
182
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,890
Natsuboshi, why are you so red?
183
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,520
Because I had a sad dream last night
184
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,600
My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
185
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,520
Swollen as I cried…
186
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:09,060
Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
187
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm searching for a child
who has gone afar
188
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,770
He can't be found. though I search all day
189
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,730
My sad dreams come once more
190
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,560
Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru!
191
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,730
Where’s the lady? Your mom.
192
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,020
Hey, where’d she go?
193
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,270
What?!
194
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,890
This is bad…
195
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
Mother!
196
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,890
Even if it costs my life,
I can’t let that star be…
197
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,020
There mustn’t be any more
sad mothers and children!
198
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,940
Can’t let it happen.
lf she gets reckless…
199
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,060
and ends up using that Jutsu again…
200
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,060
It became the village’s power
and protected the village.
201
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,400
I didn’t want to have to destroy it…
202
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,350
But star, you have caused
pain and suffering
203
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,890
to one too many of the children…
204
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,810
Forgive me…
205
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,100
Akahoshi…
206
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,600
Ninja Art: Kujaku
207
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,980
Beast!
208
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,890
Sumaru…
209
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,440
So your strength has given out?
How tragic.
210
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,650
Mother…
211
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,890
Hey, what’s the matter?
212
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,890
It couldn’t be! Lady Natsuhi is…
213
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,190
Mother died!
214
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,890
As of this moment,
215
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,690
I, Akahoshi, shall bear the name
of Fourth Hoshikage!
216
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,890
I shall announce the first mission
as Hoshikage.
217
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,810
The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto,
218
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,350
and the Hidden Leaf Shinobi
are enemies who demean us!
219
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,440
If you find them attempting
to enter the village,
220
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,060
bring them down immediately!
221
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,600
Yes, my lord!
222
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,900
I will…
223
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,770
I will get the one who killed
my mother!
224
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,890
Sumaru!
225
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,190
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
226
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,890
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
227
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,520
Yellow Moon.
228
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,350
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
229
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,560
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
230
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,520
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
231
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:18,400
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
232
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,100
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
233
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:31,890
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
234
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,650
A magical chord change, in a restless city
235
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,690
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
236
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,060
Damn that Akahoshi jerk!
I can’t forgive him anymore.
237
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,810
He’s diabolical.
238
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,890
Hey, you two!
239
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,890
I’ll pound him with a good one.
240
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,890
Forget it. Don’t stick your nose
into their internal affairs.
241
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,520
Then, I’ll beat him into shape
with my Lotus.
242
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,150
That’d be the same as Naruto.
243
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,600
Then what’re you saying we do?
244
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,650
Anyway, I’m going, so.
245
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,310
I’ll go with you.
246
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,850
No. Do you guys want to start
a war with the Hidden Star?
247
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,890
Next time: “The Star’s Radiance.”
//%
1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,820
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,860
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,130
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,540
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,480
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,150
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,820
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,590
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,130
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,900
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,400
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,770
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,740
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,210
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,780
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,290
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,820
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,860
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,000
Rockin' my heart
20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,670
Such intensity...
21
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,310
If I take a breath or move my eyes
I will be marked and killed –
22
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,810
that's what I'm feeling..
23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,820
If I'm stuck like this for an hour,
I'll go mad.
24
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,660
Facing a Jonin intent to kill…
25
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,830
This sensation is like having
my life held in limbo...
26
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,270
No way! I'd rather die
to escape this feeling!
27
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,800
Sasuke...
28
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,710
Don't worry. I'll protect
you all with my life.
29
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,180
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed.
30
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,620
I don't know about that...
31
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,700
It's over.
32
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,830
Sensei! Behind you!!
33
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,240
Die!!
34
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,480
The Water Clone Jutsu...?
35
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,820
It can't be.
36
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,420
Don't move!
37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The Oath of Pain
38
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,820
It's over.
39
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,690
W-Wow!!
40
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,200
Did you say it's over?
41
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,800
You don't understand, do you?
42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,740
You won't be able to beat me
just by making like a monkey…
43
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,780
No chance.
44
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,320
But, I must say you're good.
45
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,860
My Water Clone Jutsu was
being copied at that point…
46
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,830
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed.
47
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:25,800
By letting the clone talk as if it were you,
you succeeded in distracting me.
48
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,740
And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu
to hide yourself to see what I was doing…
49
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,310
But…
50
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm not a fool.
51
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,620
That one was a fake too!
52
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,070
Now!
53
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,580
Makibishi spikes…!
54
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,510
How foolish...!
55
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,820
Sensei!
56
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,020
Oh, I can't believe that
Kakashi Sensei got …
57
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,120
kicked away like that….
58
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,130
His Taijutsu skills are also
extremely good.
59
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,430
W-What's with this water...?
lt's awfully heavy.
60
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,800
Humph... Fool!
61
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,910
It's the Water Prison Jutsu!
62
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,270
Darn it.
63
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,450
My temporary escape
into the water…
64
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,510
was a huge mistake!
65
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,820
You're caught…
66
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,790
It's a special prison that makes
it impossible for you to escape!
67
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,460
It makes things harder
having you able to act.
68
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,390
Now…Kakashi.
69
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,400
I'll have to settle things
with you later.
70
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,800
First, I will finish those guys off.
71
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
Water Clone Jutsu…
72
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,210
Didn't expect this level of skill…
73
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,820
You're acting big,
wearing a headband like a Ninja…
74
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,360
But…a real Ninja is one
75
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,060
who has hovered between
life and death numerous times.
76
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,000
In other words,
77
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,500
only those who are worth being listed
in my Bingo Book
78
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,740
deserve to be called Ninja.
79
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,810
Guys like you can't be
called real Ninja.
80
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,810
He's disappeared again!
81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,830
You're just a kid!
82
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,830
Naruto!
83
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,700
You three! Take Tazuna and run!
84
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,530
You have no chance
against this guy!
85
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,700
As long as he has me trapped
in this Water Prison,
86
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,070
he won't be able
to move from here.
87
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,340
And he shouldn't be able to use
the Water Clone Jutsu
88
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,610
if he's far enough away
from his real body.
89
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,780
In any case, just run for now!
90
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,950
Run away?
91
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,880
You've got to be kidding me.
92
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,490
That option was gone
from the moment you got caught.
93
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,920
Even if we ran,
94
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,730
without you, sooner or later
we'd be defeated by Zabuza…
95
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,530
and we'd all be destroyed.
96
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,670
Even if we were to reform
the Manji defense,
97
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,070
it would be impossible
to block his attacks.
98
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
In the end…
99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,270
we'll have...
100
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
no options left.
101
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,750
In order for us to survive,
our only option is to rescue you.
102
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,820
We'll just have to do it!
103
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,900
There…!
104
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,830
Too easy.
105
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,610
Sasuke!
106
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,750
Sasuke…
107
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,820
T-This is the Jonin level…
A real Ninja…
108
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,820
We've got to run…
At this rate…
109
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,360
Seriously…! Seriously…!
110
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,490
We'll be killed!!
111
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,750
I'm going to swear on
the pain of my left hand!
112
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,020
I'll never get into another situation
from which I'll have to be rescued…
113
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,730
I'll never be afraid or
be a coward.
114
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,870
Are you hurt…scaredy cat?
115
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,200
I won't lose to Sasuke.
116
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,450
Can I borrow that
Leaf headband for a while?
117
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:41,950
This?
118
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,330
This is worn only by those who have
graduated from Ninja Academy.
119
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,860
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.
120
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,740
Congratulations on your graduation.
121
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,170
That's because you're
all squirts
122
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,910
who don't have the qualifications
to become Ninjas.
123
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,450
Missions are all risky assignments.
124
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,820
You pass!
125
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm not that little prankster
that you think I am!
126
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm going to surpass the Hokage!
127
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,690
And so I'm going to get
the entire Village
128
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,860
to acknowledge my existence!
129
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,230
That's right…
130
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,240
I am a Ninja now. And...
131
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,840
I decided that I was not going
to run anymore!
132
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,240
That I wouldn't run away…!
133
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,820
Y-You fool! Stop it!
134
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,820
Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!
135
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,090
Humph! Fool...
136
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,070
What are you thinking…
charging off on your own?!
137
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
Even Sasuke is no match for him…
138
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,610
No matter how hard we try,
we Genin are no match for him…
139
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,290
Huh...?!
140
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,660
The headband….?!
141
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,650
Hey! You, with no brows...
142
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,350
Record in your Bingo Book…
143
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,020
about the man who will one day
become the Leaf Village's Hokage.
144
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,830
Leaf-style Ninja…
145
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,570
Naruto Uzumaki!!
146
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,540
Naruto…
147
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,280
When I first saw that little kid,
he seemed so unreliable…
148
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,690
Sasuke! Lend me your ear!
149
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,520
What is it?
150
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,160
I have a plan.
151
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,130
You want to discuss plans
under these circumstances…?
152
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,390
This guy...!
153
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,830
Humph!
You are talking of teamwork?
154
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,570
W-What is this feeling…?
155
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,100
Was Naruto so…?
156
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,740
Now...
157
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,340
Let's get wild…
158
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,980
Now, let's get wild!
159
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,820
Such loud snorting,
but do you have a winning plan?
160
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,530
T-This isn't good…
161
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,460
What are you guys doing!
I told you to run!
162
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,060
It was obvious what was going to happen
once I was caught!
163
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,170
Hurry! Run!
164
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,200
Listen to me!
Our mission is to protect Tazuna!
165
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,070
Have you forgotten that?!
166
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,040
Old man….
167
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,680
Well...
168
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,150
This is a seed that I planted…
169
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,990
I can't say that
I want my life to be spared.
170
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,360
Sorry, you guys…
171
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,830
Fight as much as you want!
172
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,830
You hear that?
173
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,700
Are you ready?
174
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,010
You guys really haven't learned
anything, have you?
175
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,880
W-What?!
176
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,150
You're still playing at being Ninja?
177
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,020
When I was your age,
178
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,830
this hand was already
stained red with blood!
179
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,030
Zabuza, the Demon!
180
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,800
Ohh…? It seems that
you've heard of me.
181
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,380
A long time ago, in the Mist Village,
often called the town of Blood Mist,
182
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,980
Ninja candidates faced
their biggest hurdle.
183
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,820
So you also know about
that graduation exam…
184
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,290
That graduation exam?
185
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,490
What is it...?
186
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,630
This graduation exam
that you're talking about...
187
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,800
The students killed each other.
188
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,800
What….?
189
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,240
Classmates who had shared rice
from the same pot
190
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,750
formed pairs and tried
to kill each other.
191
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,820
It didn't end
until one of them died.
192
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,690
Partners who used to talk about
each other's dreams and aspirations…
193
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,890
How cruel…
194
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,830
Ten years ago,
195
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,800
the Mist Village's graduation exam
was forced to undergo drastic reform.
196
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:11,410
That was because an evil demon
had appeared on the scene the previous year.
197
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,950
Reform?
198
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,150
What about the reform?
199
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,120
What had that evil demon done?
200
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,830
With no scruples or hesitation…
201
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,930
a young boy who didn't even have
the qualifications for being a Ninja,
202
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,400
annihilated over a hundred examinees.
203
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,620
That sure was…fun…
204
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,270
Sasuke!
205
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,120
Die!
206
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,820
Darn!
207
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
208
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,000
Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu,
and there are quite a few of them.
209
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,830
Here I go!
210
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,010
It's impossible, after all…
211
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,820
There is no way that
you can defeat the guy!
212
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,160
There is only one way left
to defeat this guy!
213
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,830
Sasuke!
214
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,000
I see!
215
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
So that's your plan, Naruto!
216
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,900
That's pretty good for you!
217
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,480
Demon Wind Shuriken,
218
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,920
Windmill of Shadows…
219
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,960
A Shuriken won't work on me.
220
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,950
I see. This time
it's aiming for my real body…
221
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,820
But...
222
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,250
It's not so easy!
223
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,460
A Shuriken in
the Shuriken's shadow...!
224
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,830
This is...
The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
225
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,070
A second Shuriken
in his blind spot!
226
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,110
But...
227
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,820
Still too naïve...
228
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,280
He dodged it!!
229
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,330
Here it is!
230
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,670
Yes! The plan worked!!
231
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,570
That Zabuza had no clue
as to what I was thinking,
232
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,840
and I fooled him!
233
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,810
Ninja must be able
to see through the obvious.
234
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,810
Did you see that – the Leaf-style fighting
of Naruto Uzumaki?!
235
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,480
Kakashi Sensei,
the rest is up to you.
236
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,790
Next episode:
"Kakashi, Sharingan Warrior!"
237
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,720
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,660
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,930
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,340
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,010
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,750
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,620
To none does belong,
8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,490
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,760
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,630
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,030
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,400
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,370
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,840
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:10,420
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,920
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,630
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,630
Rockin' my heart
20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,610
Here we go!
21
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm gonna take care of
my duties with gusto again today!
22
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,040
Whoa! Mach 5!
23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,980
A New Chapter Begins:
The Chunin Exam
24
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh!
25
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,040
Good morning, Sakura!
26
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,680
Hmph!
27
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,620
Oh, not again!
28
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,020
These two...
29
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,890
They've been sort of strange since
we got back from the Land of Waves…
30
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,160
Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...
31
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,630
Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!
32
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,030
Cha!
33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,610
Well...
Good morning, everyone...
34
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
Today I got lost.
35
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,950
Hey!
36
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,660
Hey, hey...
Kakashi Sensei!
37
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,390
Our Group Seven always has
the easy missions lately!
38
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,000
Aren't there more exciting
missions where I can be more active,
39
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,570
where I can use my Way of the Ninja
and my soul…you know?
40
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,040
Oh yes yes...
41
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,210
I basically understand what
you're trying to say.
42
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,480
Shoot!
43
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,620
He's always making me
indebted to him
44
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,090
and making himself look good
during our missions!
45
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,590
I won't lose, no way!
46
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,960
You little...!
47
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,830
Today for sure!
48
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,250
Hmm...
You are so much trouble!
49
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,050
That's what I'd like to say!
50
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,790
Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto?
We're going on our mission!
51
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,220
Okay!
52
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,290
You've been so annoying for a while!
53
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,770
I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!
54
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Hey you!
55
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,080
What?
56
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,290
Oh, Mrs.!
57
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,620
I've gotten rid of all the weeds!
58
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,260
What?
59
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,390
What's wrong?
60
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,330
Those... those aren't weeds.
61
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,360
Huh?
62
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,540
Those are herbs
I grew in my garden!
63
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,700
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
64
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,160
Somebody…help…!
65
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,970
No way! Free fall!
66
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,870
Huh?
67
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,410
You idiot.
68
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,550
Hey!
69	01:56:47:23	01:56:50:03
TRAP FIELD
DO NOT ENTER
Don't go over there!
69
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,530
Hey! Please stop!
70
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,460
That fool...
71
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh no! That's because he
stubbornly chose that big dog.
72
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,240
Hey, hey! Wait a minute,
wait a minute!
73
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,180
That's the trap field over there…
74
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,150
Yikes!
75
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,370
Well! It's because you're so reckless!
76
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,610
Geez, you are so much trouble.
77
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,080
Zazuge--!
78
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,620
If you act up any more, I'll finish you!
79
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,130
Mmm…
Teamwork hasn't been good lately.
80
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,200
That's right, that's right!
81
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,830
Sasuke, you're to blame for
the poor teamwork!
82
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,970
You're always attracting attention!
83
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,600
That's you, you idiot.
84
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,340
If you don't want to owe me
big time...
85
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,180
you just need to become
stronger than me!
86
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,090
It seems like they're getting
along worse than before...
87
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,670
Shoot… 					This is frustrating!
88
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,000
There're plenty of guys outside
who are stronger than I am…
89
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,440
Always making me go on
this kind of lame mission.
90
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,780
Well then...
91
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,820
Perhaps we should disperse.
92
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,460
I do need to submit a report
about this mission.
93
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,560
Okay, then I'm going home.
94
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,300
Oh! Hey!
95
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,470
Sasuke, wait for me!
96
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,640
Hey, how about...
Why don't you and…
97
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,610
Why don't we work on improving
our teamwork together?
98
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,920
You're just like Naruto.
100	01:59:31:10	01:59:35:03
JUST LIKE NARUTO
99
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,120
If you have time to spend on me,
why don't you practice a Jutsu!
100
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,700
To tell you frankly,
your abilities are less than Naruto's!
101
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,330
LESS THAN NARUTO... CHA!!
Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
102
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,070
That's right…
103
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,440
It's always that way for me
during every mission.
104
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,210
I'll never be able to really
do anything at all.
105
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,280
Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,
and let's practice together!
106
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,890
Huh?
107
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,190
Sensei disappeared.
108
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,490
Was he being thoughtful?
109
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,570
Huh?
110
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,070
Pretending to be…a rock?
111
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,900
There's no such thing as a perfectly
square rock with perfect holes!
112
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,970
It's totally obvious!
113
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,610
Just what you'd expect from
the man I respect!
114
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,610
You are my rival, aren't you!
115
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,760
Hey! That's too much gunpowder!
116
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,630
With an adult sexiness!
117
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,630
I'm Moegi of the senior class
at Kunoichi Preschool!
118
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,600
I love factoring!
119
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,840
Udon!
120
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,770
The most brilliant Ninja in the village!
Konohamaru!
121
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,280
The three of us together are
the Konohamaru Gang!
122
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,110
Here we are!
123
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,080
I knew it was Konohamaru
and friends.
124
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,920
Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?
125
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,790
We're just copying what
you used to do, bro!
126
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,430
Oh…
127
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,130
What's with the oh!
128
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,230
Your reactions have been
pretty cold these days!
129
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,300
So, did you want something?
130
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,970
See? Cold.
131
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,740
So, leader!
Do you have some free time now?
132
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,610
Nah!
133
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,810
I have to train!
134
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,620
What?! You said you'd
play Ninja with us today!
135
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Oh…? Is that right?
136
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,490
Geez…
137
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,430
If I played with these guys
they would make me hang out all day.
138
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,630
Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja?
139
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,670
W-What is it?
140
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,510
So, abilities less than this guy, huh?
141
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,380
You are making me blush
with those stares…
142
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,150
Naruto, who's she?
143
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,990
She's been staring at him with eyes
like she's gonna kill him!
144
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,630
Oh!
145
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,930
You've been busier
than I thought, bro...
146
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,630
Huh?
147
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,600
Is she your...?
148
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,610
This?
149
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,180
Shucks, you guys are
pretty sharp for kids!
150
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,210
No way!
151
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,620
Bro!
152
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,720
What are you doing?!
153
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,760
No! Leader!
154
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,200
His pulse, his pulse …!
155
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,330
You ugly wench! Ugly wench!
156
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,870
Huh?!
157
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,210
Nooooo!
158
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,630
Hmph!
159
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,630
Are you all right, Konohamaru?
160
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,600
Oweee...
161
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,780
Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench!
ls she a girl for real?
162
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,290
Yikes!
163
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,380
That hurt...
164
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,610
– Huh? 					– Huh?
165
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,750
So, I have formally received
the report from you.
166
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,990
Is Naruto getting along with the others?
167
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,030
Hmm?
168
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,760
Well, he's doing okay.
169
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,330
I've been busy lately.
170
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,540
I haven't had a chance to see him
even once since his return.
171
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,740
I'm a little concerned...
172
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,610
As you know, Iruka Sensei,
Sasuke is also in our squad,
173
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,950
and Naruto sees him as a rival,
which is a little straining.
174
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,890
But, the result is that his abilities
are developing significantly.
175
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,290
Almost to the point that
he might reach yours,
176
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,160
the one he respects!
177
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,490
I see…
178
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
I wonder what it is?
179
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,610
Shoot!
180
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,050
Right now?
181
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,630
These guys…
182
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,560
Konohamaru!
183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,230
That hurt, little punk!
184
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,800
Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!
185
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,040
I'm sorry…
I was fooling around…
186
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,880
What are these two?
187
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,510
Hey stop!
Let go of that hand!
188
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,390
Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...
189
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,720
Let's play with them before
the strict one comes around.
190
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,490
Let go!
191
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,330
You're pretty lively,
you little punk...
192
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,170
You jerk!
193
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,220
Wha--?! 					What was that?
194
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,130
Leaf Village's Genin are
weaker than I thought.
195
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,300
T-These guys are foreign...
196
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,360
Why are they here?
197
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,700
Konohamaru…
198
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,500
Konohamaru!
199
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,140
Konohamaru!
200
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,140
It... It hurts …
201
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,420
Hey! If you don't let go of him,
I won't forgive you! You fool!
202
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,090
You're the fool!
203
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,420
What are you gonna do
by getting him worked up!
204
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,630
You're ticking me off.
205
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,630
I-I don't like little runts anyway.
206
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,000
On top of that,
207
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,170
you're a smart aleck for
someone younger than me.
208
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,370
Makes me want to break him.
209
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,180
It's not on me.
210
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,050
What's with this guy?
He's crazy…
211
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,220
Well, after this little squirt,
it's the little runt that won't shut up!
212
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,030
You!
213
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,630
Huh?
214
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,610
What do you think you're doing
in someone else's Village, you…
215
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,610
Sasuke!
216
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,620
He's pretty cute.
217
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,620
Bro!
218
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,960
Another little punk to tick me off!
219
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,630
Get lost!
220
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,570
Wow! So cool!
221
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,610
Naruto, you're lame!
222
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,310
S-Stupid! I would've quickly
taken down that thug too!
223
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,050
Hmph!
224
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,650
Sasuke, you!
225
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,320
Why're you always,
always meddling like this!
226
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,630
Hey, come down here,
you little punk!
227
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,000
You're the kind of smart aleck
little punk that I despise the most.
228
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,670
Wait! You aren't thinking of
using Crow, are you?!
229
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,320
Kankuro, stop that.
230
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,380
Huh?
231
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,430
You're an embarrassment
to our village.
232
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,800
G-Gaara...
233
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,640
When did he get next to me?
234
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,510
It's stealthy footsteps
on the level of Kakashi...
235
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,260
There is no other reason to
summon you here other than…
236
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,620
As I assume you already understand,
237
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,960
based on the faces
you can see around...
238
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,630
So it's already that time...
239
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,600
The other Lands have already
been notified, right?
240
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,840
I've seen them here and there
in the village.
241
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,610
And, when will it be?
242
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,610
In a week...
243
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,580
That's very sudden.
244
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Now… I will make the
formal announcement.
245
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,990
Seven days from today…
246
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,160
On the first day of July,
the Chunin Exam will begin!
247
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,200
Yes, yes, yes!
248
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,870
It's the Chunin Exam,
it's the Chunin Exam!
249
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,570
If I were to win first place or something,
becoming a Hokage would be closer!
250
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,700
There's no way I can lose!
251
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,670
Konohamaru, you think so too, right?
252
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,070
What?
253
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,610
Who the heck snatched up Moegi,
and what 're you gonna do?
254
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Stop, I won't let you get away!
255
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,550
Next time:
"Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals"
256
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,620
As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!
//%
1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,250
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,260
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,060
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,240
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,270
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,510
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,120
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,470
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,310
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,480
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,820
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,330
Akamaru Trembles:
Gaara’s Cruel Strength!
20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
That guy...?
21
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,480
Everyone hide!
22
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,180
No, lie low quick!
23
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,550
W-Where is that guy?
24
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,180
Naruto...
25
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,550
That fool, he finally woke up.
26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,360
You are quite one of a kind.
27
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,560
Actually, you are getting on my nerves.
28
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,710
Sakura!
29
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,540
– What? 					– Y-Y-Your...!
30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,310
Sakura... your hair!
31
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,550
Oh! This...?
32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,850
I’m changing my image,
changing my image!
33
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,720
I like it better long but,
34
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,560
when I move around in
a forest like this,
35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,460
it gets in the way if it’s long.
36
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,570
By the way...
37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,270
why are you guys here?!
38
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,870
Hah... It’s such a pain
to explain it to you.
39
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,610
Everybody helped out.
40
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,610
Huh?
41
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,620
Sakura’s putting on a show of bravado...
42
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,550
I’ll take care of him from here.
43
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,020
Ah... Okay...
44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,190
Keep it together! Lee!
45
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,600
Oh? Tenten, why are you here?
46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,270
I came to help.
47
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,900
Huh...?
48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,510
Those guys,
where’s the Sound Village Ninjas?
49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,110
A kid named Sasuke
drove them away!
50
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
Really…
51
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,380
Why did you hastily decided
to act on your own?!
52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,520
Besides, you really got beaten up!
53
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,160
S-Sakura was in danger.
So as a man, I...
54
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,360
You’re kidding...!
55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,730
If it were Lee alone,
he wouldn’t have lost to those guys.
56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
You’re really stupid.
57
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,970
I can’t argue with that.
58
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,470
You, Bushy-Brow!
59
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,970
Naruto!
60
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,740
Don’t say rude things to Lee!
61
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,480
What in the world...
62
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,250
happened while I was asleep?
63
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,220
That Naruto,
he’s completely out of the loop.
64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,830
He’s not the type to be
the protagonist of a story, certainly not.
65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,570
Lee...
66
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,600
Thank you.
67
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,540
Because of you,
I was able to wake up.
68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,540
I feel like I’ve gotten a little stronger!
69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,550
Sakura...
70
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,990
It looks like my efforts
weren’t enough!
71
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Sasuke... Just what you’d expect
from the Uchiha clan.
72
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,690
To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,
73
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,100
just as I thought,
you possess amazing strength.
74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,630
I was beaten to a pulp.
75
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,540
What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!
76
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,970
What’s he talking about?
77
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,780
Were those guys really that strong?
78
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,940
Sakura!
79
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,250
The Lotus of Leaf Village
blooms twice.
80
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,980
Huh?
81
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,550
When we meet again,
I will have become a stronger man.
82
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,560
I pledge it.
83
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,260
Okay.
84
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,200
Hey Sakura!
85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,930
Come here, come here!
86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,570
Your hair! I’ll fix it for you!
87
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,640
That'd be great.
88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,980
You are really sneaky.
89
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,980
Hugging him like that,
you little billboard brow.
90
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,520
It’s called first come-first served,
Miss Ino-pig.
91
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,400
Sasuke... Uchiha.
92
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,140
At any rate…he’s a strong opponent.
93
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,070
Are you okay, Akamaru?
94
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,150
Is he still shaking?
95
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,710
It’s already been half a day.
96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,020
Akamaru...
97
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,760
I don’t blame him,
it’s because he saw that thing...
98
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,960
After all, brains are most important
in survival!
99
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,700
Right. Akamaru?
100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,300
Lucky for us,
101
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,900
the guys who got caught in
the trap had an earth scroll!
102
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,010
We’ll be the first to
the tower at this rate!
103
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,110
Don’t get carried away.
That’s dangerous.
104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,650
No matter how small a bug it is,
it has to guard itself at all times.
105
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,680
We have to pay attention to avoid
coming across any enemies...
106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,820
This is safety.
107
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,850
I know that!
108
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,230
As always, you’re speaking in a way
that’s difficult to understand, bug-nerd.
109
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,130
Um... B-But...
What Shino said...
110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,570
He has a point.
111
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,170
I know! C’mon.
112
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,540
Naruto...
113
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,510
I hope nothing’s happened to him...
114
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,540
Hey you two, stop.
115
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,220
We’re being careful not to
come across enemy, right?
116
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,150
Then Hinata!
117
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,550
Can you see 1 kilometer
in that direction?
118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,560
Yep... I’ll have a look.
Byakugan!
119
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,000
T-There’s someone there.
120
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,940
Evidently there are... 6 people…
121
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,540
Okay! Let’s go look!
122
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,610
Huh?
123
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,650
Kiba! What are you saying?
We’re not doing that.
124
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,880
The Proctor told us to bring
125
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,550
one of each “Heaven” and “Earth”
scroll in a pair.
126
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,560
He didn’t say not to
take more than that.
127
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,560
If we take more, that means
some other teams will be left out.
128
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,560
B-But...
129
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,930
We’ll just see what’s going on at first..
130
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,770
If it looks too dangerous,
we won’t battle for no reason.
131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,140
– Let’s go! 					– Oh!
132
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,840
He’s an irritating type, that one.
133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,820
What’s up, Akamaru?
134
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,950
What happened? You stopped suddenly.
135
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,090
Akamaru suddenly got frightened.
136
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,060
W-Why is that?
137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,130
Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy’s
Chakra and tell his strength.
138
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,440
But this is the first time I’ve
seen him this scared.
139
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,340
The people going at it up ahead
aren’t ordinary guys...
140
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,550
Sand Village kids coming
to challenge us forthright.
141
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,550
It’s foolish.
142
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,730
What’s that little guy thinking
to get involved with those guys...?!
143
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,710
W-What is Akamaru saying...?
144
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,240
He’s saying that big guy is dangerous.
145
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,550
T-They certainly look like bad news...
146
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,380
They seem really strong.
147
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,560
Hey, kids, you should
pick your opponents...
148
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,920
You’re all going to die.
149
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,690
That’s enough of you.
150
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,760
Let’s do this quickly...
old chap from Hidden Rain Village.
151
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,800
Which scroll do those guys have...
152
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,640
Hey Gaara!
153
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,110
Doesn’t it make sense to
follow them
154
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,380
and gather information
before hunting them?
155
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,450
If they have the same type of scroll
there’s no need to fight.
156
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,710
Unnecessary battles are….
157
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,150
It doesn’t matter.
158
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,990
If their eyes meet with mine...
I’ll kill them all.
159
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,330
That’s why I don’t want
to be with this guy.
160
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,730
Well, let’s do it. Quickly!
161
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,840
Die, kid!
162
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,410
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
163
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,540
Hidden Senbons!
164
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,020
Up down right left,
there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.
165
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,560
In addition, all the Senbons are
controlled by my Chakra
166
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
and attack on the intended prey!
167
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,570
Too easy.
168
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,180
Is that all?
169
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,710
I-It can’t be...?!
170
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,180
Not even one...?
171
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,850
No wounds...? Ridiculous!
172
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,550
Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?
173
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,530
Well, I’ll make it rain blood.
174
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,780
What a giant Chakra.
175
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
And, that sand...
176
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,520
It smells terrible.
177
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,550
Smell?
178
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,560
A strong smell of blood...
179
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,130
Wall of sand...?
180
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,560
That’s right.
An absolute defense by sand!
181
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,570
He manipulates sand inside
a gourd and
182
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,540
hardens it with magnified Chakra.
183
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,970
It defends the circumference
of Gaara’s body.
184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,470
It’s a Jutsu that only
he can get away with...
185
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,540
Furthermore, it’s somehow always
automatically done
186
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,550
without Gaara’s intentions.
187
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,650
Which means that all attacks
in front of Gaara fade into nothing.
188
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,420
That little...
189
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,860
You guys can’t defeat our Gaara.
190
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Don’t underestimate me!
191
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,300
This guy's a goner…
192
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,800
That’s what you get for rebelling
against Gaara...
193
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,210
Sand Coffin!
194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
I can’t move...
195
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,890
T-This won’t...!
196
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,970
I can cover your loud mouth
and kill you.
197
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,280
But that’s too pathetic.
198
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,270
Sand Burial!
199
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,650
There’s no pain.
200
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,560
I knocked him even harder
than was necessary.
201
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,360
The bloody tears of a corpse merge
with vast sinking sand
202
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,000
and provide more power
to the demon of war.
203
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,500
T-The scroll.
204
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,240
We’ll give it to you!
205
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,270
Please! Let us go!
206
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,150
No-o-o-!
207
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,360
T-This is bad.
208
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,760
Let’s escape quickly!
lf he finds us he’ll kill us!
209
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,170
Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.
210
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,270
Okay! Let’s go to the tower.
211
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,540
Shut up.
212
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
It’s still…not enough for me!
213
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,510
U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!
214
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,650
Let’s quit... Gaara.
215
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,460
Are you scared, coward?
216
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,800
Gaara! It’s certainly no problem for you,
but it’s too dangerous for us!
217
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,400
One set of scrolls is good.
218
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,270
More than this is...
219
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,410
Lame people don’t give directions to me.
220
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,780
That’s enough!
221
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,310
How about if you sometimes listen
to what your big brother has to say?!
222
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,250
I’ve never thought of you as my siblings.
223
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,690
If you get in my way... I’ll kill you.
224
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,460
G-Gaara cut it out! Please.
225
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,000
Don’t say something so cold.
226
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,970
As a favor to your sister... Okay?!
227
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,430
Gaara!
228
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,440
Fine.
229
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,590
That’s why I hate brats.
230
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,000
What? So that’s it Akamaru?
231
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,840
C’mon, you should have
said something sooner.
232
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,210
Nobody’s here...?
233
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,920
Heh heh! We’re the first?!
234
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,850
No, I sensed someone a little while ago.
235
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,190
More importantly, is Akamaru okay?
236
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,060
He’s been scared ever since then.
237
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,000
Now that you mention it,
what did Akamaru say before?
238
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,670
Oh... Akamaru said that it
was dangerous
239
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,800
because that sand squirt
would kill that big guy.
240
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,540
Sheesh! Just like I thought,
there’s no other place to go!
241
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,210
They’ve already made us
wait for half a day!
242
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,540
How much longer do we have to wait?
243
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,800
Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...
244
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,470
I don’t know what he is but,
that guy…
245
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,970
He’s too dangerous.
246
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,550
It’s becoming a real disaster,
but we can’t cancel this test.
247
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,550
What do you mean?
248
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,990
Excuse me!
249
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,560
What is it?!
We’re talking about something important!
250
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,390
Excuse me.
251
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,530
But... Uh...
252
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Please take a look at this!
253
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,230
The video...?
254
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,270
Ready? Here! Look at the time!
255
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,550
T-This is…
256
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,720
It’s a recording inside the tower,
257
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,550
one hour and thirty-seven minutes
after the start of the second test!
258
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,930
Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Village
broke through the second test.
259
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,130
This can’t be...!
260
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,570
In a mere ninety-seven minutes...
261
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,770
This has never happened!
262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,470
This is an anomaly.
263
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,110
Those guys are not Genin level.
264
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,550
They’ve rewritten the
fastest time by four hours…
265
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,650
It’s not just that.
266
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,080
What do you mean?
267
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,560
It’s 10 kilometers
from the test entrances to the tower.
268
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,390
Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,
the rugged forest road...
269
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,800
As if those were not there…
270
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,430
Especially the brown-haired kid
right in front…
271
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,600
What about him?
272
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,240
You don’t notice?
273
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,980
I see. This is quite a surprise.
274
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,980
What about him is so...?
275
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,150
Look closely at his body.
276
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,700
I see.
277
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,130
He doesn’t have a single scratch.
278
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,540
What’s worse, there's not
a smudge of dirt on his clothing.
279
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,910
Even I...
280
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,980
No, any of the other Chunin...
281
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,550
It’s impossible for us to
make it to this tower without a scratch.
282
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,520
It’s likely that it has something
to do with his ability.
283
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,990
After a long time, a dependable
guy has appeared.
284
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,590
Even though he’s got evil eyes.
285
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,570
Hey, can you hear it?
286
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:37,710
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
287
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:47,480
The ocean spans limitlessly
288
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,590
Please keep that smile on your face forever
289
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,600
Or else I’ll cry
290
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,540
You won't have to search around you
291
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,170
It’s all ok now.
292
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:19,020
Everyone is inside
this hand
293
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,550
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
294
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,930
When you forget what happiness is
295
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,730
Just sing.
296
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,230
Light is born, and darkness was born
297
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,540
The two are one
298
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,780
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
299
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,520
Hey, can you hear it?
300
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,260
– Please! 					– No!
301
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,720
– Just a little bit. 					– No!
302
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,960
– Really only a little bit.
– No means no!
303
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,560
I’ll just look a little and put it back.
304
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,160
Remember what the
Proctors said, loser.
305
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,400
When they say don’t look, don’t look,
306
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,540
it just makes me want
to look all the more!
307
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
If you can look when you can,
let’s look!
308
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
Naruto lost it!
309
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,940
Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!
310
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,540
Next episode: “The Scroll’s Secret:
No Peeking Allowed”
311
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,550
I really want to look!
//%
1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,150
Press down hard on the gas
2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,060
That’s right, there’s no compromise
3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,130
We'll slip through the night
4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,930
At the final moment push hard
5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,100
That's right, all the way to zero,
6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Until we wipe away the days
7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,380
Gently open your heart
8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,980
If you pull it close to you
9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,550
It will reach you, without a doubt
10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,560
It will come, closer
11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,560
Now
12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,910
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth
13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,340
Our feet are tied
14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,180
But we still keep going farther
15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,620
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,350
If you’re not the one
17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,690
There will be no meaning
18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,090
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,990
Special technique!
20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,060
Shadow  Clone Jutsu, fishing version!
21
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,260
Thrash about more!
22
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,820
I want to catch some for curing!
23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,430
Three isn't enough!
24
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Three more, you loser!
25
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,000
This is very taxing, you know?!
26
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,940
I mean, let's switch!
27
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Sasuke!
28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,210
The fire's ready to light!
Fireballs please.
29
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,550
I guess three is okay for the time being…
30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,750
Wha--?
31
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,180
Hey, wait a minute!
32
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,060
The Scroll's Secret:
No Peeking Allowed
33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
It's already been four days
since the second exam started.
34
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah.
35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,630
That's right.
36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,840
The start of the second exam
was around three in the afternoon.
37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,970
We only have twenty-five or
twenty-six hours left.
38
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,810
There may already be
some teams that have passed.
39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,440
That means…
40
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,480
I wonder if it'll be broiled soon.
41
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,820
We're soon going to be in a hot spot…
42
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,960
That's the biggest one.
43
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,060
Believe it!
44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,230
Okay…
45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,800
Even if we were to try pursuit,
46
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,570
there's probably hardly anybody left
to become targets.
47
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,800
What do we do?
48
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,840
Almost everyone's surely already passed.
49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,710
Yeah.  It's already been
four days, after all.
50
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,550
Anyway…
51
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,550
It's early afternoon now…
52
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's have a meal.
53
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,390
You two rest a bit and
I'll go find us something to eat.
54
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,570
Say…
55
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,670
Hmm?
56
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,470
As I recall, on the other one…
57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,940
"Heaven" was written here…
58
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,650
and unlike this,
both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?
59
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,250
Umm, when I was shown
the scroll before the exam,
60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,250
I wasn't really looking.
61
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,550
So, what of it all of a sudden?
62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,090
Y-You've got to be kidding…?
63
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,840
For all we know…
64
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,680
there may not be any Heaven scrolls.
65
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,140
What do you mean, Sakura?
66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,550
Well, in this second exam…
67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,750
four of the five-day
time limit have passed already.
68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,660
So that means we've already
used eighty percent of the total exam time.
69
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,430
Seventy-eight participants
and twenty-six teams.
70
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,560
There are only thirteen each
of the Heaven and Earth scrolls.
71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,870
At most there are only
thirteen passing teams.
72
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,540
Moreover, you remember,
don’t you, Sasuke?
73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,550
That the Orochimaru guy burned
the “Heaven scroll” that we had.
74
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,550
Which means…
75
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,690
The teams that will pass had already,
at that point, decreased by one.
76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,550
Hmm?
77
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,560
Also, all of the other scrolls are
not necessarily safe, so…
78
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,070
After parting ways with
the Leaf Village bunch,
79
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,570
we allotted two days for healing…
80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,670
So from here on, we have to increase
the distance of our actions.
81
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,680
At any rate,
the next enemy is our last chance.
82
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,250
I'm going to get some drinking water.
83
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,230
Say! Say!
84
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,770
I have a good way for us not to fight
with an enemy. Believe it!
85
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,900
What?!
86
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,310
Get serious!
87
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,280
I am serious.
88
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,550
I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.
89
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,520
Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual,
for notes….
90
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,750
If we tweak this a little and change it
into exactly like the Heaven scroll…
91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,350
H-Hold it!
92
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,260
Huh?
93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,860
Even if you did such a thing,
you don't know what's written on the inside!
94
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,900
If the Proctor looked inside
you will be discovered right away!
95
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,700
Idiot!
96
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,130
Generally with things like this,
97
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,170
there's a password or
something written
98
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,340
and you can’t get it
unless you have both scrolls.
99
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,540
In other words…
100
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,110
to pass at the tower goal,
we'll surely need a password.
101
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,110
Or something like that.
Believe it!
102
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,550
What difference does it make?
103
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,550
If you don't know the content,
there's no use making a fake!
104
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,390
Man, here I was wondering what
you were going to say, looking all big…
105
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,730
You're an idiot who just can't
think through things.
106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,760
B-But…
107
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,800
What if we could predict the content…?
108
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,540
This Earth scroll…
109
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,940
You wouldn't…
110
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,710
I'm going to…open this scroll!
111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,840
No!
112
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,510
You! Have you forgotten
even the rules, you idiot?
113
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,750
We were told not to look inside the scrolls
until arriving at the tower, right?
114
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,050
But, at this rate,
we’ll be in a hot spot, right?
115
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,020
There might be a trap or something.
116
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,960
Carefully… Be careful.
117
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Yeah.
118
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,560
I know…
119
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,570
Hey, what's wrong?
120
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,970
Hey!
121
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,540
What's wrong?
122
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,610
What happened?!
123
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,550
Hey!
124
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,190
Hey! 					Answer me!
125
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,330
You'd best not do it.
126
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,600
An enemy?
127
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,810
Man, you're beyond saving…
128
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,150
That was close.
129
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,480
W-We're sorry.
130
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,160
Those who ignored the rules are forced
into the situation of having to retire.
131
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,230
In the previous exam, hypnotism
Jutsu Formula was set up to
132
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,460
get into the eyes of those who looked
at the scroll along the way.
133
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,640
A measure to get them to lie
in the forest until the end of the exam.
134
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,010
By the way…
135
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,110
If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?
136
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,140
What're you doing hanging
around here alone?
137
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,850
It's not that I'm after your scroll.
138
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,220
I didn't think so.
139
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,820
If that was your intention…
you could've taken it from Naruto just now.
140
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,860
So you're also after the Heaven scroll?
141
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,060
No.
142
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,490
I already have them both.
143
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
See?
144
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
What?
145
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,870
Things led to things…
146
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,900
I was hurrying over to
the vicinity of the tower
147
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,600
to wait for my estranged companions.
148
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,570
Now, if you'll excuse me…
149
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,080
Wait!
150
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,650
Fight me.
151
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,460
Lucky!
152
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Fight you, you say?
153
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
S-Sasuke.
154
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,690
This idiot-suke.
155
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,400
What are you saying suddenly?
156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,930
Are you serious?
157
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,640
Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.
158
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,410
Hey, Sasuke!
Kabuto saved us!
159
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,140
Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.
160
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,180
Shut up!
161
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,550
Sasu…ke.
162
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,550
It can't be helped.
I said it before, too.
163
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,560
This is all that can be done
to survive through this forest now.
164
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,560
Hmm…That's a lie.
165
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,390
A lie?
166
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,000
Your heart isn't totally in this
as much as you're saying.
167
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,110
If you could really become
serious about this exam…
168
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,010
Why is it necessary to fight me?
169
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,850
You should jump on me
at my unguarded moment,
170
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,620
without going to
the trouble of announcing it.
171
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,250
That's…a Ninja.
172
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,260
Hmm, that's profound.
173
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,560
I don't dislike that side of you.
174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,570
So I shall tell you the way you should go.
175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,670
However…let's talk as we move.
176
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,140
The smell of broiled fish in the fire smoke
had reached a great distance.
177
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,540
At this rate, we'll be marked
by fierce animals…and enemies.
178
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,550
Humph!
179
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Are there really still enemies around?
180
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,630
Yes, no mistake.
181
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,600
If you think about it a little,
you'll understand.
182
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,470
Do you know the cleverest way
of fighting in battles
183
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,070
in jungles and
expansive forests such as this?
184
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,540
No.
185
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,140
The tower located in the center
of this forest,
186
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,350
the common goal for us test-takers.
187
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,320
That means when the last day
of the test is here…
188
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,550
the area near that tower is
the easiest place to gather scrolls.
189
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,560
Oh, I see. 					Ambush, right?
190
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,190
In other words, we go after the scrolls
of the teams
191
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,230
that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls
and are setting out for the tower.
192
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,570
That's one-third of the answer.
193
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,570
What?
194
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,600
I mean that you guys are
not the only ones thinking that!
195
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Near the tower, the same badgers
have probably already set traps, so…
196
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,610
I see!
197
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,880
That means there are lots of enemies
lying in wait to engage us.
198
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,320
Heh, having a handicap
gets me pumped, I say!
199
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,590
I'm looking forward to it!
200
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,260
If we just beat them all and
get the Heaven scroll,
201
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
we'll all survive the second exam!
202
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,260
No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!
203
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,560
What's the remaining
one-third of the answer?
204
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,570
The collectors who are certain
to appear during an exam of this nature.
205
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,400
Collectors?
206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,010
In this exam, with the tower
just a stone's throw away,
207
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,010
you definitely can't rest easy…
208
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,540
Those particular conditions
are what create them.
209
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,810
In other words,
those who gather extra scrolls…
210
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,820
as compensation for sparing them
when coming across an unexpected enemy.
211
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,560
Also, those who get information to
proceed favorably through later exams
212
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,560
by providing the lacking scrolls to
comrades sharing the same village.
213
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,530
And those who are thinking of,
under conditions favorable to them,
214
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,440
annihilating the powerful ones who
will probably get through to the third exam.
215
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,180
It goes without saying,
but these guys are quite the big guns
216
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,950
and the worst enemies who
are definitely not conceited.
217
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,250
I see.
218
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,250
I understand the reason
why you appeared before us.
219
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,560
You're scared, too, right?
220
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,560
That's right.
221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,300
Now then, the tower has finally
come into view.
222
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,170
From here on is the hard part.
223
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,540
All right, let's go!
224
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,140
An enemy already?
225
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,140
There!
226
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh, it's just a centipede.
227
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,430
Yikes! It's huge.
228
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
All those legs are gross.
229
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,000
Naruto.
230
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,000
Huh?
231
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds and
careless actions from here on.
232
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,140
Huh?
233
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Rushing ahead through a dense forest
making noise like an elephant
234
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,980
is the same as serving notice
in a loud voice that we're coming.
235
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,150
We'd definitely receive
an enthusiastic welcome.
236
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,850
O-Oh, I see.
237
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,560
As long as time allows, we should
go slowly while remaining hidden.
238
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,560
– Yeah. 					– Okay.
239
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,390
Sure.
240
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,470
Heh, not bad, everyone.
241
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,150
Oh?
242
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,560
Okay, it's this way.
243
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,120
Is it a trap?
244
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,890
Yeah.  It'll get intense ahead from here on.
245
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,710
Kabuto!
246
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,540
H-Huh?
247
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,450
That was close, Naruto.
248
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,380
Substitution Jutsu!
249
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,320
I told you, it would get intense ahead
from here on.
250
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,160
I've…had it…
251
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,270
Oh! Sakura!
252
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,070
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?
253
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,110
The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.
254
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,640
Here we can see it right
in front of our eyes.
255
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,280
Strange…
256
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,010
No mistake about it.
257
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,750
It seems that we're already
within the enthusiastic welcome.
258
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,550
Take a look at that.
259
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,560
Oh, that can't be!
260
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,360
What on earth is going on?
261
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,000
No way!
262
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,730
Is it Genjutsu…?
263
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,430
So it seems.
264
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,740
We were lured in perfectly.
265
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,470
It appears we were
meticulously careful,
266
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,080
and were made to walk around
the same place in a circle.
267
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,250
We're being watched…
268
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,650
Probably.
269
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,150
They intend to wear down
our physical strength and
270
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,420
catch us unprepared
when we're bone-tired.
271
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,560
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
272
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,360
Then... they'll be coming soon.
273
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,710
They’ve appeared.
274
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,140
Hah!
275
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,310
This is the perfect handicap.
276
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,260
Hey, can you hear it?
277
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:31,500
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
278
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:41,010
The ocean spans limitlessly
279
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:49,390
Please keep that smile on your face forever
280
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,330
Or else I’ll cry
281
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,100
You won't have to search around you
282
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,730
It’s all ok now.
283
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:12,580
Everyone is inside
this hand
284
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:18,150
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
285
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,550
When you forget what happiness is
286
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,520
Just sing.
287
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,760
Light is born, and darkness was born
288
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,100
The two are one
289
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
290
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,080
Hey, can you hear it?
291
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,550
What's with these guys?
292
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,520
Crawling out all of a sudden?
293
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,550
Fighting in numbers isn't necessarily
a good thing, you know?
294
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,950
Since it's come to this,
295
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,860
it'll be a comparison of
the number of Clone Jutsu.
296
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,560
I can get twice of twice of
twice of twice of your...
297
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,400
Anyway, I'll multiply
to an incredible number!
298
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,570
It doesn't matter if it's
your Genjutsu or whatever.
299
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,530
I'll kick all their butts!
300
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,670
Next episode: "Clone vs. Clone:
Mine are Better than Yours!"
//%
1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,720
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,700
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,970
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,370
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,040
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,780
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,580
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,560
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,790
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,600
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,100
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,470
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,440
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,870
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,450
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,950
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,660
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,670
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,590
You're an embarrassment
to our village.
21
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,120
Why do you think we came all
the way here to Leaf Village?
22
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,230
P-Please listen to me, Gaara.
23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,900
T-They lashed out first…
24
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,100
Shut up!
25
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,430
I'll kill you.
26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,000
U-Understood, I was wrong.
27
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,570
I-I'm sorry…
I'm really sorry.
28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,510
I'm sorry about that…
29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,580
This guy…has a nasty look.
30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,550
To think he was able to hit
that Kankuro
31
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,590
with a tiny rock with great ease.
32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,290
This guy's…good.
33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,600
Let's go.
34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,470
We didn't come here
to play around.
35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,970
I know.
36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,570
Hold it!
37
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,870
What is it?
38
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,810
Judging from your headbands,
39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,580
you're Ninjas from the Village
Hidden in the Sand, right?
40
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,280
Without question, the Land of Fire and
the Land of Wind are allied nations.
41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,220
But the arbitrary coming and
going of Shinobi
42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,020
is supposed to
be prohibited by the treaty.
43
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,020
State your purpose!
44
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,590
Depending on circumstances…
45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,990
Hmph! So this is what they mean
46
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,360
by the darkest place being
under the candlestick.
47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,060
Don't you know anything about it?
48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,260
My permit!
49
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,570
As you say, we're Sand Village Genins
from the Land of Wind.
50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,240
We came to this village to
take the Chunin Exam.
51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,310
Chunin Exam…?
52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,580
Identify Yourself:
Powerful New Rivals
53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,450
What is the Chunin Exam anyways?
54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,790
You really don't know
anything, do you?
55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,890
Bro, if you pass the exam,
you can become a Chunin from a Genin!
56
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,260
I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!
57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,100
Heh!
58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,330
Hey! You there…
59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,970
What's your name?
60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,870
Huh?  M-Me?
61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,910
No! The gourd next to you!
62
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,750
I'm Gaara of the desert…
63
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,450
I have an interest in you as well…
64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
What's your name?
65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,590
Sasuke Uchiha.
66
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,430
Say! Say! What about me?
What about me?
67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,330
Not interested.
68
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,640
Heh! Things have gotten interesting.
69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,510
Konohamaru, do I look weak?
70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,210
Compared to Sasuke, yes...
71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,380
Sasuke, I won't lose to you!
72
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,850
What's gotten into you,
all of a sudden?!
73
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,550
What do you think?
74
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,590
I don't think they're anything special.
75
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,590
But the black-haired one from Leaf Village
and the gourd from the Sand Village…
76
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,590
those two need to be checked.
77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,430
Now then, in conjunction
with beginning the Chunin Exam,
78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,640
let us first have those in charge
of the rookie Genin come forward.
79
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,580
Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma…
80
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,480
So?  Are there any Genin from
your squads
81
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,080
you wish to recommend
for these exams?
82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,290
It goes without saying,
83
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,590
but if it's a Genin who has carried out
eight or more formal missions,
84
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,960
you can recommend them
for the exams if you wish.
85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,430
Well, as a general rule,
86
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,570
having carried out more than twice
that amount of missions is appropriate.
87
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,370
There's no need to hear this…
88
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,570
It's too soon for them.
89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,140
Then, you first Kakashi.
90
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,910
The Kakashi-led Group Seven...
91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,150
Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.
Sakura Haruno.
92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,790
I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these
three for the Chunin Exam.
93
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,260
Huh?
94
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,930
The Kurenai-led Group Eight...
95
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,400
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,
Shino Aburame.
96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,570
These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi,
recommend the same.
97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,570
The Asuma-led Group Ten...
98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,580
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,
Choji Akimichi.
99
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,280
These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi,
recommend the same.
100
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,580
All three recommended…
101
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,590
To think rookies will be
in the Chunin Exam…
102
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,590
Hasn't it been five years
since that's happened?
103
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,720
Hmm…
104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,220
Wait a minute!
105
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,860
What is it, Iruka?
106
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,590
Lord Hokage, please let me
say one thing.
107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,600
This may be presumptuous,
108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,900
but as for the nine names
that were given,
109
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,170
I was in charge of them at the Academy.
110
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,570
Admittedly, they were all students
with ability,
111
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,940
but it's too soon…!
112
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,810
They should be tested after
having gained more experience!
113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,380
I became a Chunin when I was
six years younger than Naruto is now.
114
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Naruto is different from you!
115
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,090
Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!
116
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,060
They always do nothing but complain
about important missions…
117
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,060
Teaching them a lesson
once would be fun.
118
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,600
Trying to crush them
would be interesting, too.
119
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,600
W-What did you say?!
120
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,570
Well, joking aside…
121
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,570
Iruka Sensei...
122
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,040
I understand what you want to say.
123
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,740
It's aggravating, I know.
However…
124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,010
Kakashi...
125
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,510
Don't do it.
126
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,420
Stay out of this!
They're not your students anymore!
127
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,420
Now they're my subordinates!
128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Man…troublesome people.
129
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,330
B-But the Chunin Exam
is also known as…
130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,270
Iruka…
131
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,940
I understand your point.
132
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,140
Master Hokage...
133
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,410
Therefore, I have decided to conduct
134
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,280
a special preliminary exam
for these rookie Genins.
135
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,080
P-Preliminary exam…?!
136
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,290
Say! Say! Say!
137
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,530
Why is it that he's the one who
always calls us out,
138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,930
and then makes us wait?!
139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,430
That's right! That's right!
140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,670
What's he going to do about
the feelings of a maiden
141
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,570
who accidentally overslept and resigned
herself to no blow-drying?!
142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,510
I overslept, so I haven't washed my face
and didn't brush my teeth.
143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,680
Y-You…That's dirty.
144
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,920
Why're these guys so hyper
first thing in the morning?!
145
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,190
Hey, good morning, folks!
146
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,590
Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life…
147
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,230
Right! That's a lie!!
148
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,100
Uh, well…
149
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,600
This is sudden, but I recommended
you guys for the Chunin Exam, so…
150
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,570
Here, these are your applications.
151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Chunin Exam…
152
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,740
That being said, the recommendations
are not compulsory.
153
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,580
You guys are free to decide whether
you take the Exam or not.
154
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,580
All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!
155
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,350
Hey, cut it out. Get away already…
156
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,350
Only those who want to take the Exam,
sign that application and
157
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,590
come to Room 301 of the Academy
at 3:00 p.m. five days from now…
158
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,730
That's it!
159
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,530
Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!
160
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,570
Chunin Exams, eh…
161
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,310
I bet lots of strong guys would be there…
162
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,840
For example, that guy!
163
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,210
And this guy!
164
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,920
Okaaay! I won't lose to
anybody no matter what!
165
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,330
If I take the first place, the path to
the Hokage is right there!
166
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Sure enough, it's decided that Naruto
will be the Hokage…
167
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,340
I'll just retire my elderly self at once.
168
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,440
Yaaaay!
169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,580
I might be able to fight him.
170
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,450
I...don't want to…
171
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,550
Here I can't…
172
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,060
keep up with Sasuke,
and not even with Naruto…
173
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,660
The Chunin Exam, no way…
174
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,590
Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!
175
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,860
Sure. I don't have any missions today,
so I'll play with you guys!
176
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,590
Yaaay!
177
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,260
Oh!
178
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,700
Leader! Konohamaru!
179
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,140
What're you going to do with Moegi?!
180
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,240
Hey, you! Let Moegi go!
181
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,010
Darn!
Let's follow them, Konohamaru!
182
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,480
Y-Yeah!
183
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,680
W-Wait!
184
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,030
Chunin Exams, eh…
185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,730
Yo.
186
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,700
S-Sasuke, what's up?
187
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,270
How about we go for a little walk?
188
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,210
No way! For real?!
189
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,350
Well well... So you can keep up
at this speed, eh?
190
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,580
Wait for me! Moegi!
191
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,590
Bro, where'd you go?
192
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,690
I think we are lost.
193
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,630
Nooo! Let me go!
194
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,460
Even the strongly fortified
Village Hidden in the Leaf…
195
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,530
is mine if I slip in the
middle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.
196
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,600
Hmm?
197
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,570
That was fast…
198
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,140
Hey! You fat old man!
199
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
What're you going to do with Moegi?
200
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,380
What am I going to do, you ask?
201
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,080
You want to know?
202
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,150
Wha--?!
203
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,280
Don't move!
204
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,050
If you do,
the brat's dead meat!
205
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,090
Y-You. Why're you doing this?!
206
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,420
I want the first Hokage's
Scroll of Sealing!
207
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,590
If you bring it to me,
I'll return the brat!
208
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,230
Scroll of Sealing…
209
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,430
Umm…
210
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,400
Sasuke…
211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,270
What's up, all of a sudden?
212
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,140
Sakura…
213
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,580
Give up on the Chunin Exam…
lt's too early for you.
214
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Is it…?
215
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:47,710
I thought so…
216
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,350
The Chunin Exam is
a gathering of top dogs…
217
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,590
You might die if you're not careful…
218
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,620
Sasuke…
219
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,220
So you're worried about me, right?
220
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,360
Yeah…kind of…
221
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,030
What a display of affection, eh?
222
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,300
Get lost! If you don't want to die.
223
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,430
Don't talk as if you know everything!
224
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,300
Don't make me angry!
225
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,200
Sasuke!
226
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,540
Don't take me lightly!
227
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,580
Sasuke!
228
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,600
Sasuke?
229
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,600
Sasuke!
230
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,500
Sasuke!!
231
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,570
What're you doing?
232
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,510
Hurry up and bring me
the Scroll of Sealing!
233
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,910
What'll happen…if I say, heck no?
234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,710
You don't care what happens
to this brat?
235
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,220
Heh, I'm fine with whatever happens
to that bunch of straw, I say.
236
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,590
Wha--?!
When did he do that?!
237
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,620
I've taken Moegi back from you,
thank you!
238
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,590
As expected great leader!
Moegi respects you.
239
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,660
Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh…?
240
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,170
You don't know when to give up!
241
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,370
Naruto!
242
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,970
Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!
243
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,680
Konohamaru, I was scared.
244
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,180
Oh, there-there…
245
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,650
Leader, did you catch him?
246
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,590
Yup, as you can see!
247
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,850
Huh?  What?!
248
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,560
Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!
249
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,590
Dang it! When did he switch?!
250
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,490
I see…
251
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,600
If you don't want to turn out
like this,
252
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,500
you'll give up on
the Chunin Exam, too.
253
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,540
Sasuke, don't die…!
254
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,580
Big mistake if you think
I'd say that.
255
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,280
I was aware of this Genjutsu
right from the start!
256
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,350
What?!
257
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,720
The real Sasuke wouldn't do
something like
258
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,050
invite me to go for a walk!
259
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,220
Don't make me say
such frustrating things!
260
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,460
That kind of elementary Genjutsu
won't work on me!
261
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,590
Did you say elementary…?
262
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,760
That's right!
263
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,600
Incidentally, I've seen through that
you're also an illusion
264
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,100
and aren't really here!
265
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know about…
266
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,700
that!
267
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
See?
268
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,580
Just what I'd expect of
Kakashi's subordinate.
269
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,780
However, this will become reality
in the Chunin Exam!
270
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,590
I wonder if you can endure that…?
271
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm not scared!
I'll take them on anytime!
272
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,430
The Chunin Exam isn't...
The Chunin Exam isn't…!
273
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm still not sure if I can do it…
274
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,570
That was a stupid thing to do…
275
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,080
How was it?
276
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,720
We went to the trouble of having
a special preliminary exam,
277
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,490
but all nine of the rookies passed.
278
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,600
As you say, it appears their skills
have definitely improved.
279
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,570
Well, the actual Chunin Exam
won't just end at this, but...
280
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,870
Hey, have you heard?
281
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,670
Rookies are going to be
in the Chunin Exam
282
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,810
for the first time in five years.
283
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,580
No way.
284
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,880
It's probably just a Jonin battle of wills
or something anyway.
285
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
No…
286
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,450
The story is that three among them
are that Kakashi's unit.
287
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,590
That's interesting…
288
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,790
Well, be that as it may…
289
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,960
That's a sad story…
290
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,570
Sakura, you're late!
291
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,340
Yeah…sorry…
292
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Morning, Sasuke.
293
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,450
Yeah…
294
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,350
Something's strange about Sakura.
295
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,590
So, are you sure you're going
to attempt taking
296
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,260
the Chunin Exam with that skill?
297
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,970
May it'd be best if you runts quit.
298
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,570
You're green-assed brats, after all.
299
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,240
Please let us through.
300
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,240
That's…mean…
301
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,750
What did you say?!
302
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,580
Listen!
We're being nice to you!
303
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,720
The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.
304
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,620
Many times have we seen
people quit Shinobi
305
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,930
as well as people who were
disabled for life
306
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,490
just because they took this Exam.
307
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,600
Also, a Chunin is at the level
of a unit leader.
308
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,770
Mission failures,
death of subordinates,
309
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,170
it's all part of the
responsibilities of a leader!
310
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,310
A brat such as this a Chunin?
311
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,740
What's so bad about weeding out
those who won't pass anyway?!
312
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,780
A just argument.
313
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,580
However, you will let me through.
314
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,250
And could you also immediately
undo this barrier created with Genjutsu?
315
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,790
I have business on the third floor.
316
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,960
What's this guy talking about…?
317
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,490
I don't know…
318
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,700
– Well, well…
– So you noticed, eh?
319
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,600
How about it, Sakura?
320
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,140
You should've been
the first one to realize it.
321
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,870
Huh…?
322
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,570
Your analytical strength and
Genjutsu know-how
323
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,640
has improved the most in our squad, so...
324
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,540
Sasuke…
325
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Thank you…
326
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,680
Of course. I realized it ages ago!
327
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,850
You see, this is the second floor!
328
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,850
Yup!
329
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,530
Well, not bad…
But all you've done is to catch on.
330
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,260
Right?!
331
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,840
H-He's fast!
332
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,410
This person…
333
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,250
He's a different person from
when he was getting punched before!
334
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,580
He stopped my kick…
335
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,680
What's with that Chakra in his arm?
336
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,790
Hey, this isn't what you promised.
337
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,590
You were the one who said
338
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,360
you didn't want to carelessly
attract attention and be watched.
339
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,560
But…
340
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,960
Oh boy… 					This again…
341
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,970
This guy…
342
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,940
The marks where he was hit
are disappearing.
343
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,570
Was he faking?
344
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,410
My name's Rock Lee.
Your name's Sakura, right…?
345
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,080
Huh?
346
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,520
Please go out with me!
I'll protect you until I die!
347
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,590
Absolutely…not.
348
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
Huh?
349
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,990
You're... too intense.
350
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
Hey, you there.
351
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,800
Identify yourself.
352
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,540
Dang it! Again?
353
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,170
It's always about Sasuke!
354
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,810
When asking someone his name,
give your own name first.
355
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,580
You're... a rookie, right?
How old are you?
356
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,180
I'm not obliged to answer.
357
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,580
What…?
358
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,220
Cute.
359
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,490
Too intense, huh…
360
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,600
Uninterested, huh…
361
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,970
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
362
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,940
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats.
363
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,010
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.
364
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah…
365
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,150
It appears this year's test-takers
will be amusing…
366
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,580
For us proctors too, eh.
367
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,590
Good grief…
368
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,760
This Chunin Exam…
is full of monsters.
369
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashes
and bushy eyebrows.
370
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,440
Oh! It's you!
371
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,870
You're the overly intense guy
who just got rejected by Sakura.
372
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,140
What's with your bizarre
green jumpsuit?
373
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,610
What? You want to challenge me,
bushy-browed bumpkin?
374
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,580
I'll teach you that it's a million years
too soon to be doing that.
375
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,590
Next episode:
"Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!"
376
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,390
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,820
C'mon!
2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,930
Running like a fugitive,
3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,200
Being chased by something
4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,610
Inside my heart is pounding
5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,580
My throat dry like it's withering
6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,250
For no single one,
7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,920
To none does belong,
8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,660
This time is ours, right now...
9
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,190
Unraveling the pain,
10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,000
Unraveling our hearts,
11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,500
Unraveling shadows
12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,800
Stifling our breath,
13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Reaching for beyond,
14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,270
Tearing through the dark
15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,820
In fighting and in love
16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,350
To the distant light above,
17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Yes, we are on the way
18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,960
I wanna rock...
19
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,070
Rockin' my heart
20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Die.
21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,690
Darn!
22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,590
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,560
Hmm... Shadow Clone Jutsu.
And there are quite a few of them.
24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,420
Here I go!
25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,640
It's impossible, after all...
26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,580
There is no way that
you can beat a guy!
27
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,820
There is only one way left
to defeat this guy.
28
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,520
Sasuke!
29
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,830
I see!
30
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,660
So that's your plan, Naruto!
31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,500
That's pretty good for you!
32
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,080
Demon Wind Shuriken,
33
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,620
Windmill of Shadows...
34
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,690
A Shuriken won't work on me.
35
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,810
I see.
36
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,510
This time it's aiming for my real body…
37
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,650
But...
38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,820
It's not so easy!
39
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,920
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow!
40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,020
This is...
41
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,130
The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
42
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,830
A second Shuriken in his blind spot!
43
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,370
But...
44
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,810
Still too naïve.
45
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,310
He dodged it!
46
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,830
Here it is!
47
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,900
Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior!
48
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,230
You little brat!
49
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,510
Kakashi Sensei!
50
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,490
Naruto...
51
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,120
Your strategy was outstanding.
52
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,830
You've grown up…
Both of you.
53
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,830
The purpose of the Shadow Clones
was not to take down Zabuza,
54
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,770
but to hide my transformation
into Demon Wind Shuriken!
55
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,820
I left one clone behind, then
transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken.
56
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,810
Then a clone threw the real me, who had
transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken,
57
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,810
towards Sasuke!
58
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,780
Sasuke!
59
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,480
When Sasuke got me,
60
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,420
he must have realized
right away who I was.
61
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
Then he took out his own Shuriken...
62
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
63
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,730
Demon Wind Shuriken…
64
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,430
Windmill of Shadows!
65
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,570
Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken,
I aimed for Zabuza.
66
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,910
Of course I didn't think
I would defeat Zabuza!
67
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,810
But I thought I'd destroy
the Water Prison.
68
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,420
And as a bonus
I defeated his water clone, too…
69
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,820
It was a huge success!
70
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,120
That was a fluke…
71
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,660
It was a fluke, huh!
72
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,690
Still, they performed oustandingly
in tandem…
73
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,030
in this desperate situation.
74
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,760
Despite the fact…
75
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,830
that those two always
fight like cats and dogs.
76
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,670
Hmph…
77
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,800
I got distracted and
broke my Water Prison Jutsu…
78
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,240
That's not it!
79
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,610
You didn't break the Jutsu…
80
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,040
They forced you to break it.
81
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,790
I'll tell you now,
the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.
82
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,160
So what will you do?
83
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,340
Sakura! 					Stay alert.
84
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,810
Sharingan!
85
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,910
Ushi, saru, u.
Ne, inoshishi, tori, ushi.
86
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,380
Uma, tori, ne, tora.
lnu, tora, mi, ushi, hitsuji.
87
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,820
Mi, inoshishi, hitsuji ne...
88
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,820
Ushi, saru, u.
Ne, inoshishi, tori, ushi.
89
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,890
Uma, tori, ne, tora.
lnu, tora, mi, ushi, hitsuji.
90
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,790
Mi, inoshishi, hitsuji ne.
91
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,000
Jin, saru, tori, tatsu.
Tori, ushi , uma, hitsuji.
92
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,570
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.
93
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,800
– Ne, ushi, saru, tori. Jin, ne, inoshishi.
– Jin, saru, tori, tatsu. Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.
94
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,270
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.
95
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,540
Ne, ushi, saru, tori.
Jin, ne, inoshishi.
96
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,280
Tori!
97
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,750
Water Style!
Water Dragon Jutsu!
98
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,320
He copied that chant
in seconds...
99
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,020
and so perfectly…!
100
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,660
W-What is this?
101
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,720
Is it Ninjutsu!
102
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,910
Strange…
103
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,780
What is going on…?
104
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,620
Jin, saru, tori, tatsu.
Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.
105
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,480
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.
106
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,690
The Sharingan is the ability to memorize
and copy the enemy's Jutsu...
107
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,460
But...
108
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,920
Tori!
109
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,830
Water Style!
Water Dragon Jutsu!
110
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,530
The Jutsu was set in motion
at the same time!
111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,800
By any chance, is this guy…
112
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,530
This guy…!
113
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,490
The same identical movement!
114
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,420
Furthermore, at exactly
the same time!
115
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,890
What's going on, Sasuke!
116
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
This guy…
117
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,070
My movements…!
118
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,810
He's perfectly…
119
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,640
Reading them.
120
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,210
What?
121
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,920
He's reading my mind?!
122
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,820
Blast him! He's...
123
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,830
giving me
that barren, evil eye… right?
124
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,830
Hah! You're just copying…
You're a pale imitation.
125
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,800
– You won't be able to beat me!
– You won't be able to beat me!
126
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
– You! 					– You!
127
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,910
I'll shut that copycat
monkey-mouth permamently!
128
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,020
W-What's that!
129
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,720
Me?
130
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,330
R-Ridiculous!
131
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,260
Is that his Genjutsu (Illusion Jutsu)?
132
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,800
Water Style!
Giant Vortex Jutsu!
133
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,810
W-Wha--!
134
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,420
No way!
135
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,330
I was just about to
set forth that Jutsu...
136
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,400
I can't keep up with…
137
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,870
his Jutsu!
138
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
It's over…
139
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,270
Why...?
140
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,910
Are you able to see into the future…?
141
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,810
Yeah…
142
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,820
You're going to die!
143
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,710
You were right. He died.
144
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,390
He's definitely dead.
145
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,830
I thank you.
146
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,940
I have been waiting for the chance
to kill Zabuza.
147
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,040
By the looks of that mask...
148
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,310
You're a Tracker Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Mist.
149
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Impressive. You're very knowledgeable.
150
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,290
Tracker Ninja?
151
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,420
You don't know what
a Tracker Ninja is?
152
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,830
We learned it at
the Academy, didn't we?
153
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,830
Tracker Ninja pursue…
154
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,500
guys like Zabuza who turn against
the village where they were born and raised.
155
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,040
And when they break away from
the village,
156
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,200
Tracker Ninja go after these Rogue Ninja
and assassinate them….
157
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,110
in order to avoid having
the secrets of the village being leaked.
158
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,810
That's common knowledge!
159
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,480
You should study more!
160
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,280
That's right.
161
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,950
I'm a member of Hidden Mist Village's
Tracking Unit
162
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,490
whose mission is to
hunt Rogue Ninja.
163
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,360
From his height and voice,
he's not all that different from Naruto…
164
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,830
A Tracker Ninja… ?
165
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,410
He's not just an ordinary kid…
166
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,900
What are you?!
167
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,280
Hey you!
168
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,750
Don't worry, Naruto.
He's not an enemy.
169
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,820
That's not what I'm asking!
170
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,990
I…!
171
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,960
I mean...!
172
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,490
That Zabuza…
That Zabuza was killed!
173
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,830
That guy who was so strong…
174
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,900
He was killed so easily... by a kid
who's no different from me!
175
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,530
We're…
176
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,740
We're pathetic!
177
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,470
I can't accept that!
178
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,240
Well!
179
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,610
I understand your disbelief.
180
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,880
But… this, too, is reality.
181
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,660
In this world, there are kids
who are younger than you…
182
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,590
and stronger than me.
183
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,450
Your battle is over for now.
184
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,220
I must get rid of this corpse…
185
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,830
because it contains many secrets.
186
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,230
Now then, please excuse me.
187
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,400
He's disappeared!
188
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,480
He's not here anymore.
189
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,320
What was all this for?!
190
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,030
What are we anyway?!
191
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,830
Naruto…
192
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,340
Darn it! Darn it! Darn it!
DARN it!
193
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,610
Things like this happen
when you're a Ninja.
194
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,910
If you're frustrated,
apply it next time!
195
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,850
Our mission hasn't ended yet.
196
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,820
We must take Mr.Tazuna home.
197
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,400
So sorry, everyone!
198
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,570
You can rest at my house!
199
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,900
Okay!
200
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,600
Let's perk up and go!
201
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,750
W-What!
202
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,850
What happened!
203
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Kakashi Sensei!
204
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,830
Kakashi Sensei!
205
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,270
What'll we do?!
206
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,740
Kakashi Sensei has collapsed!
207
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,240
Gato's henchmen are probably
gonna come and attack us again!
208
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,810
Guess it means we've gotta
fight by ourselves.
209
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,480
Who knows if this training will
make us stronger but,
210
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,080
it's getting interesting!
211
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,820
I'll definitely get stronger.
212
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Next time:
"The Forest of Chakra."
213
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,790
I'm going to kick butt once again!
//%
1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,590
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,430
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,550
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,850
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,390
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,010
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,590
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,050
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,600
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,640
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,260
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,590
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,720
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,590
Wait, Naruto!
16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,260
I won’t wait.
17
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,430
I told you not to be acting
on your own.
18
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,800
Then you’re saying to
leave Sumaru be?!
19
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,100
Sumaru just now seemed
quite upset…
20
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,590
He’s definitely intending to
get revenge on Akahoshi.
21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,590
Now that he’s been tarred with
the reputation of Rogue Ninja,
22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,430
he’ll have no place to go
throughout his life
23
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,390
if he raises a hand against
the village leader.
24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,590
Hokuto?
25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Mother!
26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,010
I finally…
27
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,600
Here, I finally got to meet you…
28
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,590
Mother.
29
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,590
The Star's Radiance
30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,470
Wh-What’re you doing?
31
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,050
Shh! Don’t be acting on
your own anymore.
32
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,550
But, something’s strange.
33
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,010
This number of Ninja is
indeed something serious.
34
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,180
It seems they’ve mobilized all
of the village Ninja.
35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,350
Anyway, we should see
how things go for a little while.
36
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,100
Byakugan!
37
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,510
Sumaru’s inside the training room…
38
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,590
Hey, what about Sumaru’s mom?
39
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,760
Damn it!
40
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,590
Sumaru…
41
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,550
Do we really have to do away
with him?
42
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,680
He’s still a kid.
Wouldn’t it be okay to let things slide?
43
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,300
At this moment,
he’s a dangerous element.
44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,850
No good would come
of letting him live.
45
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,010
But Sumaru’s been
the most effective Genin in the village.
46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,760
We have more than
enough materials…
47
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,050
We can just train more…
48
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,590
Materials…?!
49
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,590
I won’t stand for it anymore!
Leave it to me!
50
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,510
– Forget about it.
– Let go of me!
51
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,590
I’m going to kick
that Akahoshi jerk’s butt.
52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,550
This is a Star Village issue.
53
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,050
Village issues have to be resolved
by those in the village.
54
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,590
Isn’t there something
we can do for him?
55
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,890
That’s right.
56
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,100
Let’s charge on in and
box Akahoshi’s ears…
57
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,590
What’re you saying?
58
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,550
That’d be the same as Naruto!
59
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,600
Are you saying we must
remain idle spectators
60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,140
even when things have gone this far?!
61
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,140
That’s right!
62
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,100
As long as there’s no commission from
the village to kick Akahoshi’s butt,
63
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,350
there’s nothing we can do.
64
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,590
Archer unit! Forward!
65
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,970
Fire!
66
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,850
Until now, I felt resentment towards you,
Mother, for leaving me behind.
67
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,550
But…I understand clearly now.
68
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,180
I understand why you
had to do that.
69
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,680
Akahoshi… I will never forgive him!
70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
Sumaru…
71
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,600
Wh-What a pitiful mother and son, eh?!
72
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,260
What’re you talking about…?
73
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,220
I buried them both together…
There is no greater happiness.
74
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,590
Incredible Chakra!
75
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,890
Wait!
76
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,590
This jerk’s an enemy...
He suddenly attacked.
77
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,140
You’re Leaf Shinobi, right?
78
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,350
I can tell even if you give me
the runaround…
79
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,760
The people from other lands
are all after the star.
80
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,010
If you have that power,
81
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,720
you can stand above all of
the Hidden Villages.
82
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,510
Is your awesome Chakra also
the power of the star?
83
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,180
If they had that star,
84
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,260
would everyone have
the same Chakra as you?
85
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,350
No! The more tremendous the power,
86
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,350
the more hard work is required
to control it!
87
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,140
I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard!
88
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,510
I’ll become the Hoshikage!
89
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,430
Yeah! I look forward to working
with you at that time!
90
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,930
I’m also going to become
the Hokage someday, believe it!
91
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,970
You’re a strange guy.
92
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,350
Really?
93
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,010
That red star sure is pretty…
94
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,890
Natsuhiboshi…
95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,430
It watches over me all the time…
96
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,350
Are you still gonna say
I should bear it after all this?
97
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,970
Sumaru!
98
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,050
Sumaru…
99
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,590
Listen, everyone.
100
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,470
If you continue the star training,
you’ll all die.
101
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,890
Sumaru’s mother is the one
who took away the star.
102
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,600
She did that in order to
protect everyone’s lives!
103
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,220
Lord Akahoshi?
104
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,590
Is it true that we’ll die?
105
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,970
Are you going to believe
such nonsense?!
106
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,050
Being unable to withstand
the star training
107
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,300
is because the heart that loves
the village is weak!
108
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,430
Those who really love the village
can become true Shinobi
109
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,100
and can also surpass the Hidden Villages
of the Five Great Nations!
110
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,590
Hokuto or Lord Akahoshi…
Who’s telling the truth?
111
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,590
Mizura?!
112
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,890
In that condition…!
lt’s reckless!
113
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,140
Wait, everyone!
114
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,300
There’s… There’s something
I want everyone to see.
115
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,590
Mizura…
116
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,600
What’s that?
117
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,930
What’s going on?
118
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Is that the effect of the training?
119
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,720
How awful.
120
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,350
Lord Akahoshi… I take pride in
the Hidden Star Village.
121
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,590
Even though it was painful,
122
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,390
I endured it and continued
the star training…
123
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,720
Even so, were my feelings for
the village still not enough?
124
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Mizura!
125
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,010
I don’t think there could be lies
in that child’s words…and body.
126
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,390
Yes. So that’s why
the Third Hoshikage prohibited
127
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,510
the star training for a long while.
128
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,470
We adults got carried away with
our feelings for the village
129
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,890
and may have made the wrong choice…
130
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,300
You loser!
131
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,680
Do you intend to mislead everyone
and crush the village?!
132
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,800
What’re you doing, Akahoshi?!
133
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,720
They aren’t traitors.
134
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,800
They’re children of our village!
135
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,590
Protect Hokuto and Mizura.
136
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,800
Are you going to betray the village?!
137
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,800
I can’t go along with your way
of doing things, Lord Akahoshi!
138
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,350
Me, too.
139
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,590
Me, too!
140
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,510
Me, too.
141
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,590
Me, too.
142
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,220
Death to those who betray the village!
143
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,590
Execute them all!
144
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Are you insane, Akahoshi?
145
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,930
If we lost all the children,
there’d be no future for the village!
146
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,970
H-Hey…
You’re taking things too far, Akahoshi.
147
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,350
Take everyone’s feelings into
consideration and yield for now.
148
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,850
Shut up!
What’re you doing talking nice now?
149
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,180
We’ve long since dirtied our hands.
150
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,890
S-Stop! What’re you going to say?
151
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,390
Akahoshi, what do you mean?
152
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,590
There’s a star in this village that
no other villages possess.
153
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,800
I just thought we didn’t need
a foolish village leader
154
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,590
who wouldn’t allow the star to be used.
155
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,140
What?!
156
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,550
Could it be that you are the ones who
killed the Third Hoshikage?!
157
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,970
Indeed, there were suspicious rumors
concerning the Third Hoshikage’s death.
158
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,140
Akahoshi, prepare yourself
and answer!
159
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,590
You’ll pay depending on your answer.
160
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,590
The three of us assassinated
the Third Hoshikage!
161
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,260
It was the quickest way
to save the village.
162
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,470
Say what?!
163
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,970
You guys are the traitors!
164
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,590
– Right! 					– Right! Right!
165
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,590
No, don’t get the wrong idea.
166
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,100
We just helped a little.
167
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,590
Idiot. That’ll be an acknowledgement!
168
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,760
Akahoshi!
169
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,590
We will not acknowledge you
as leader of the village.
170
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,390
Justice is not with you anymore.
171
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,050
It is the children who possess the hearts
that truly care about the village.
172
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,220
Everyone! Let us rise together
with those children
173
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,550
for the sake of the village.
174
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,180
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!
175
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,300
We’re sorry, children.
176
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,600
We were completely taken in
by Akahoshi’s fast-talk.
177
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,220
As of now, we’ll fight with you!
178
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,140
Give it up, Akahoshi.
179
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,720
We’ve lost!
180
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,050
Shut up! I haven’t lost.
181
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,590
Mizura!
182
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,720
Hokuto… Live for me…
183
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,260
Mizura!
184
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,390
Akahoshi, we won’t let you do as
you please anymore!
185
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,390
I won’t let you do something
like go against me!
186
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,970
Have you gone mad?!
187
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,850
Akahoshi, you’ve lost!
188
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,800
Give in to justice with good grace!
189
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,510
I won’t lose!
190
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,100
The star is now…in my hands!
191
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,430
The star?!
192
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,100
I will now become
the Fourth Hoshikage!
193
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,720
Power… I’m starting to brim
with power.
194
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,260
I do not need any training.
195
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,010
I could have become one with
the star if I’d done this from the start..
196
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,640
What…What’s this?
197
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,260
What’s that?!
198
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,510
Byakugan.
199
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,510
Massive Chakra from the star has
poured into his Chakra Network
200
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,260
and is causing it to go out of control.
201
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,640
Hokuto!
202
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,100
I can’t take it anymore!
Neji! Hey, Neji!
203
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
Don’t… Naruto…
204
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,550
No matter what you say,
I’ll kick that Akahoshi jerk’s butt!
205
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,930
You jerk. I won’t be responsible.
206
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,140
Right. Just say that I butt in on my own.
207
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,010
L-Lord Akahoshi.
208
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,510
Akahoshi!
209
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,140
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
210
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,050
Damn it!
211
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,600
You jerk.
212
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,300

237
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,590
Despite having been assigned
a mission to protect the star,
238
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,720
to think you’d smash
the all-important star…
239
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,640
You didn’t just fail to complete
the mission!
240
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,300
The compensation fee
will be massive.
241
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,050
But Grandma, I had no other choice!
242
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,600
It’s my fault as the leader for
not being able to stop him.
243
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,720
I’m responsible as well!
244
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,800
Right. I also…
245
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,180
Well, that’d be a matter
under normal circumstances.
246
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
We haven’t received complaints
from the Star Village
247
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,930
with regard to the incident of
the star being smashed.
248
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,470
In fact, the culprit of this incident
249
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,590
was the client Akahoshi,
the deputy Hoshikage.
250
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,220
So the mission itself is forgotten!
251
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,970
Come to think of it,
what happened to him?
252
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,800
It seems the three,
253
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,970
the main culprit Akahoshi and
accomplices Yotaka and Shisou,
254
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,590
will be punished severely
by Hidden Star Village!
255
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,590
That’s good! Now the Star Village
will be peaceful.
256
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,800
Come in.
257
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,930
Lady Tsunade, all the Genin from
the Star Village have been examined.
258
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,010
And…?
259
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,590
If they all receive proper treatment,
they will return to good health.
260
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,430
Hey, what about Mizura?
261
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,470
Yes. That boy will also be fine.
262
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,590
Yes! So, where’s everyone?
263
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,970
They’ve completed their examinations
and are heading for their quarters.
264
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,590
Hey, Naruto! The lecture isn’t…
265
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,930
He never changes.
266
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,260
Hey, guys.
267
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,640
That’s great! Get better, Mizura.
268
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,760
Right!
269
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,050
I won’t lose to you.
270
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,300
Huh, what?!
271
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,890
I’ll become Hoshikage before you!
272
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,390
Even without the power of the star,
273
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,430
I’ll make the Village Hidden in the Stars
into a most powerful Ninja village!
274
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,220
Say what?
275
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,850
No way will I lose!
I’ll become Hokage before you!
276
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,680
Shut up. I’ll be first.
277
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,550
I’ll be first, believe it!
278
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,640
Yesterday’s Call Sign,
was all from my cell phone.
279
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,470
In a strange park,
I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
280
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,970
Yellow Moon.
281
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,800
Even now, counting to three,
I open my eyes
282
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,010
Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
283
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,970
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,
as we face one another’s back
284
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:17,850
Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
285
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,590
EveryDay EveryNight
With every word I can think of
286
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,510
Right away, my messy feelings as is,
287
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,100
A magical chord change, in a restless city
288
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,140
A daily JAZZ Guitar played
in a soft minor key
289
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,430
Kiba Inuzuka escaped with Akamaru!
290
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,390
Kiba did?!
291
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,350
Then, have a Special Pursuit Corps
stand by in preparation for the worst.
292
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,590
Yes, ma'am.
293
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,800
Hey, just a minute. Then they’ll…
294
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,850
We have no choice.
295
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,010
The safety of the residents
must take precedence.
296
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,510
But Akamaru is Kiba’s partner.
297
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,590
I’m aware of that.
298
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,180
Then…
299
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Shut up, Naruto! I have an obligation
to protect this village.
300
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,680
Next time: “Kiba's Long Day.”
//%
1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,590
Rock away your existence,
2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,470
Shouting that you are here…
3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,590
A new journey begins now.
4
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,890
As we survived through
the changing seasons,
5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,430
we gained knowledge and strength,
(just looks like a survival game)
6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,050
But the forgotten memories,
7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,590
of the feelings abandoned within
the flows of time,
8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,100
have also been lost.
9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,640
When sinking down,
we learned loneliness.
10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,680
But now we’ve met each other,
we are no longer alone.
11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,300
Unveil your feelings,
Those high emotions
12
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,590
Those tears will change your fate.
13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,760
Pound your heartbeat
against the darkness,
14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,590
We’re sure to meet,
Under the same flag of pain
15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,850
Wow. There’s a lot of new houses
being built around here.
16
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,550
I hear it’s been a bit of
a construction boom recently.
17
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,760
Seems like a lot of the construction sites
are short-handed
18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,430
and they’re hiring carpenters
from people outside of the country, too.
19
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,590
Even I know that.
20
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,260
Oh, Old Man Genno!
21
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,140
Oh… Naruto.
22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Who is he?
23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,140
He’s a carpenter from the Land of Sand.
24
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,640
He likes ramen, and we bump
into each other at Ichiraku.
25
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,470
How about we go there after this?
26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Yeah!
27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,010
Here you go,
thanks for waiting!
28
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,470
Thank you for this meal!
29
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,640
Thank you.
30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,470
Ichiraku’s ramen is the best, after all!
31
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,220
Isn’t it so? Isn’t it so?
32
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,510
I’m sorry, but can I have some water…?
33
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,970
Sure!
34
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,010
Thank you for this meal!
35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
That was fast!
36
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,010
Are you full already?
37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,680
No… Not really…
38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,970
Then, I’ll give you mine.
39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,260
Lucky!
40
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,050
Hey, Naruto!
41
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,590
The two of them are always like this.
42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,590
They act as if they’re really
grandfather and grandson.
43
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,680
Oh come on, Sakura,
stop being so harsh.
44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,050
There’re lots of other people
who complain. Like Grandma Tsunade.
45
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,590
And there’s Shino, Ino, Kiba,
and Kakashi Sensei…
46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,510
But I guess you're the harshest, Sakura.
47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,590
Come on, Naruto!
48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,600
That’s only because
you’re always at fault!
49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,180
Now, now, Sakura calm down.
You hair will turn gray… Ouch!
50
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,930
– Looks like it’s time
– Just leave it and eat up already!
51
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,300
– I got to business…
– But I got nothing left!
52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,590
– Hey, hey.
– Help me, Old Man Genno!
53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,430
Crisis The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather
54
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,590
Damn!
55
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,720
What is it? Fog?
56
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,350
Well, I guess it doesn’t matter…
57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Lady Tsunade.
58
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,140
I’m sorry to bother you
during your sleep,
59
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,590
but the man that the Anbu Black Ops
have had marked…
60
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Has made his move?
61
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,720
He is currently on the run.
62
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
On the run?
63
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,100
Are you telling me even with
the array of the Anbu Black Ops,
64
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,590
we still can’t catch him?
65
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,800
Who is he?
66
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,590
You must know his identity by now.
67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,390
There was nobody in
the recent Bingo Book
68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,890
that fit his description,
69
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,390
but when we checked
an older Bingo Book…
70
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,850
Genno?
71
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,260
Genno the Trapper?
72
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,590
You do know of him?
73
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,590
He should be quite old by now.
74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,890
I hadn’t heard his name in a while,
75
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,470
so I thought that
he had already retired, but…
76
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,390
I never would have thought that
he was infiltrating the Leaf Village.
77
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,390
I guess I can’t fight against old age.
78
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,970
No… I guess I should say this is just
what I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops.
79
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,970
We want you to hand over the thing
you took from the master carpenter’ house.
80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,590
You think I would still be holding
onto that thing?
81
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,050
I've had a long life as a Shinobi…
82
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,010
I guess it wouldn’t be so bad to
close the curtain at this time.
83
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,100
Though I regret that
I won’t be able to see
84
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,600
the end of the Leaf Village
with my own eyes!
85
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,590
Paper Bombs!
86
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,590
Retreat!
87
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,180
Are you saying that someone
88
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,590
is planning a huge attack
against the Leaf Village?!
89
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,590
That would be the only reason
anyone would want those plans
90
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,590
besides carpentry purposes.
91
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,010
Genno’s last words suggest that as well.
92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,970
It’s going to take some time
to decipher those plans,
93
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,260
but it’s too dangerous to depend on that.
94
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,010
The enemy may
attack us any minute.
95
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,470
Activate the S-Level Emergency
Security Alert!
96
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,180
Leave the least amount of
men necessary here,
97
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,590
and all other men are to secure
the border!
98
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,300
Attack anyone who tries to cross
the border!
99
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,180
Don’t allow them to attack the village,
no matter what!
100
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,850
Such great weather!
101
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,050
Naruto!
102
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,100
Oh! Sakura!
103
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,180
That sound like a big pain in the ass.
104
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,800
I think you’ll be able to do it.
That is why we left you in the village.
105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,680
At the very least, is there any way
that we can get more people?
106
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,850
Under these circumstances,
we can’t turn over more people to you.
107
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,760
They’re the greatest line-up for you,
aren’t they?
108
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,640
The greatest…huh?
109
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Fog? Last night’s weather didn’t seem
like it was going to be foggy.
110
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,850
How strange…
Was it all a dream?
111
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,850
Doesn’t it seem like
we’re really low on people?
112
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,760
That’s what I was thinking, too.
113
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,760
From the looks of it,
114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,260
the village must be
under special security alert.
115
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,640
What?! For real?!
I didn’t notice it!
116
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,590
You should notice these kinds of things.
You’re a Ninja.
117
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,970
But if we’re in a state of emergency,
118
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,390
it’s a huge deal for the village,
isn’t it?
119
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,350
Why haven’t they told us anything?
120
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,430
That’s why Lady Tsunade is calling us.
121
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,430
Come in.
122
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,590
Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto.
123
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Shikamaru…
124
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,510
So you must’ve been left out, too.
125
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,350
Huh? What are you taking about?
126
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,220
Nothing…
127
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,010
Oh, hey Shikamaru.
About last night’s weird fog…
128
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,590
Did you see it?
129
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,010
Stop it.
You were just dreaming.
130
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,890
There was no fog.
131
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,760
See. I told you…
132
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,600
That was a smoke screen.
133
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,350
Smoke screen?
134
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,760
I’ll explain once
everyone gets here.
135
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,510
– Huh? 					– Naruto, Sakura…
136
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,590
The reason why we left you out of
137
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,890
the S-Level Emergency
Security Alert unit
138
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,930
is because we wanted you
to work under Shikamaru
139
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,970
for a special mission.
140
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,390
What?
141
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,760
Well, that’s the case.
142
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,590
First, I want you to gather
the people I’m about to name.
143
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,430
Hey, calm down, Naruto!
144
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,800
But it’s already past the time
we were supposed to gather!
145
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,220
Not quite. To be accurate,
we still have twenty more seconds.
146
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,850
Seems like he’s here.
147
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,890
Oh? Everyone’s already here?
148
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,180
No matter how you look at it,
you’re the last one!
149
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,850
Everyone’s here now.
Then let’s begin.
150
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,510
I’m sure that
you all have already noticed.
151
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,260
The village is currently under
the S-Level Emergency Security Alert.
152
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,510
It all started when…
153
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,050
The smoke screen last night, right?
154
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,590
You guys noticed it?
155
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,590
Of course.
156
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,050
The bugs were being noisy…
157
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,300
Huh? I didn’t notice it.
158
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,300
You’re always so out of it!
159
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,430
SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI!
I didn’t notice it either…
160
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,970
WORSE THAN NARUTO!!
Could it be then that
I’m worse than Naruto?
161
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,590
Worse than Naruto… Worse than
Naruto… Worse than Naruto…
162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,180
So what was that?
163
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,970
It seemed like something involving
the Anbu Black Ops.
164
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,140
So I stayed put…
165
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,590
Yeah, that’s correct.
The Anbu Black Ops were involved.
166
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,260
Just as I thought…
167
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,260
It was late last night.
168
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,800
A man that the Anbu Black Ops had
been marking for the past two weeks
169
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,550
had snuck into the home of
Leaf Village’s top carpenter boss…
170
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,550
And he stole the plans of our village’s
important facilities from the secret safe.
171
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,350
Plans…?
172
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,590
So what’s so bad about that?
173
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,010
He just stole the plans
for the facilities, right?
174
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,590
Just stole? You’re so…
175
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,590
Naruto…
176
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,590
For example, let’s say the plans for
the fort that surrounds the village
177
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,720
fell into enemy hands…
178
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,890
By analyzing those plans in detail,
179
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,760
the enemy could figure out
the most efficient way
180
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,550
to break into the village.
181
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,600
Now let’s say that there were
plans for Lady Tsunade’s mansion.
182
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,390
If you were to examine those plans,
183
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,100
you could find out how
to get the Lady Tsunade’s room.
184
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,590
And if the plans were to get
into the hands of an assassin…
185
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,390
That’s really, really bad.
186
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,390
Last night’s smoke screen was…
187
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,050
something that suspect spread
as he was running away.
188
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,850
I see…
189
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,590
In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered him
in the Western Forest…
190
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,590
He killed himself before
they could get him to talk.
191
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,590
Unfortunately,
when he committed suicide,
192
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
he wasn't in possession
of the plans he had stolen.
193
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,850
If the plans have already fallen
into the hands of the enemy…
194
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,390
it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare of
the Destruction of Leaf Village.
195
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,590
In order to prevent that from happening
196
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,300
The S-Level Emergency Security Alert
was deployed this morning.
197
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,760
So, what is the mission for those
of us who were left behind?
198
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,550
Find out the location of
the stolen plans and bring them back.
199
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,590
That's our mission.
200
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,590
It’s like finding a needle in
a haystack.
201
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,430
We just need to investigate
the path he took
202
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,260
and people he was acquainted with.
203
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,260
It turns out that the guy was famous
for being a top-level trap technician.
204
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,590
It’s a huge possibility that
he left traps where the plans are.
205
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,260
It’s definitely plausible.
206
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,930
I understand.
We’ll follow your instructions.
207
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,720
I’ll do it.
208
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,760
Then let’s start the investigation.
209
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,140
Turns out that the man
had snuck into the village
210
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,970
a few months ago and worked
as a carpenter.
211
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,050
Th-This guy…
212
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,430
His name is…Genno
213
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
You’re kidding me.
214
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,470
There’s no way! Old Man Genno loved
the ramen at Ichiraku!
215
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,050
He would never do anything that
would destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!
216
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,010
Listen… There’s no way that a guy
who’s sneaking in to an enemy village
217
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,550
would show his bad side.
218
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,220
He played the part of a good guy
to let people’s guard down.
219
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
There is no way that anyone
who loves ramen could be a bad person!
220
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,390
No. That’s not true Naruto.
221
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,180
Choji… You tell him.
Put some sense into this guy.
222
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,760
Anyone who loves Ichiraku’s ramen
can't be a bad person!
223
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,350
Choji!
224
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,590
Gosh, I can’t depend on anybody…
225
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,590
This is a list of the stolen plans.
226
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,430
I'm so embarrassed
we lost our important plans…
227
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,010
I can’t show my face to Lady Tsunade.
228
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,550
Which construction jobs
were Genno involved with?
229
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,890
None of them.
230
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,850
But wasn’t he working under you?
231
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,430
I don’t allow outsiders to work
on any construction
232
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,010
that involves the safety of the village.
233
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,850
That old man only worked
on residential construction.
234
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,800
Which means…
235
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,140
There’s little possibility that he
snuck some traps into the construction.
236
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,470
I think it’s impossible.
237
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,600
We should check everything,
just in case…
238
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,390
I’m counting on you.
239
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,590
Lady Hinata, please take care of these.
240
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Y-Yes!
241
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,180
I’ll go too.
242
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,510
Me too.
243
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,100
I’ve mentioned it earlier,
but there is a possibility
244
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,720
the the plans haven't fallen into
the enemy's hands yet.
245
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,300
It’s possible that he could have hidden it
while he was running away.
246
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,140
And it’s our mission to find that.
247
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,970
Understood.
248
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,600
It’s the start of a treasure hunt.
I’m depending on you Akamaru.
249
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Go!
250
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,430
Ino and Sakura, you guys go
check the old man's body.
251
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,590
There might be some clues.
252
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,140
What?! Us?
253
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
I got it.
254
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,590
All right! You just want me to go right?!
I’ll go!
255
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,300
Sakura, are you really okay with this?
256
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,590
I have to be. I’m training to become
a Medical Ninja.
257
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,590
I can’t be afraid of something like this.
258
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,350
That might be the case for you, but…
259
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,720
Now…master carpenter.
260
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,590
Can you tell us everything you know
about Old Man Genno?
261
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,890
The old man came to Leaf Village
about three months ago…
262
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,590
He came to my place with
a recommendation letter
263
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,800
from a famous master carpenter
from the Land of Sand.
264
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,390
As you may already know,
265
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,550
there’s a bit of a construction boom
in Leaf Village.
266
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,970
Every place is in need of more people.
267
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,590
And we needed more hands ourselves,
268
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,260
so we decided to hire him right away.
269
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,760
His carpeting skills…
were all right, just average.
270
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,220
I didn’t feel the urge to
hire him permanently,
271
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,390
nor did I feel like I wanted to
fire him right away.
272
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,390
He took his job seriously.
273
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,890
He was perfect to hire
when we were short on people.
274
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,300
But after a while,
275
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,390
I found out that the recommendation letter
he brought was a fake.
276
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,350
This is the recommendation letter
he brought.
277
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,220
And how is this a fake?
278
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,640
There was a guy who brought
a recommendation letter
279
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,300
from the same master carpenter
more than ten years ago.
280
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,850
I just happen to find that
recommendation letter,
281
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,010
so I compared it and I noticed
that the handwriting was different…
282
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,590
And that recommendation letter?
283
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,930
It’s over there in that cabinet…
284
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,590
Oh? Where did I put it?
I know I put it here…
285
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,550
It’s okay if you don’t have it.
286
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
I’m sorry.
287
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,470
For us, we really didn’t care if
his recommendation letter was a fake
288
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,720
as long as he didn’t do anything bad.
289
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,180
I just thought that I should let things
like this be known to Lady Tsunade…
290
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,140
I didn’t think that
the old man was
291
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,590
a Shinobi from another country
and that he would steal our plans…
292
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,800
I still can’t believe it.
293
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,050
Hey, is it really that
old man’s doing?
294
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,890
I can’t believe it either.
295
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,300
There're no signs of traps…
296
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,510
All right.
297
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,590
This is where the old man lived, huh?
298
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,600
He always paid the rent on time.
299
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,590
He really was quite proper…
300
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,590
Once in a while he’d come home
after drinking with his carpenter friends,
301
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,180
but he would never cause trouble.
302
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,260
Well, I did predict it,
but there are no clues…
303
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,590
I found it!
304
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
What did you find?
305
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,890
A special bonito broth, refreshing udon
and light broth super thin udon!
306
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,850
We’re not looking for food!
307
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,260
But usually if somebody
is living by himself,
308
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,590
he’d probably stack up
on a bit more food…
309
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,590
There’s only instant cup-udon.
310
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,430
Didn’t he eat out a lot?
I hear that he went to Ichiraku a lot…
311
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,010
Right, Naruto?
312
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,590
Oh… Yeah.
313
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,590
If he cooked himself, he could have
eaten more and saved money…
314
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,010
Choji, we’re not talking about you.
315
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,890
That old man
barely talked about himself…
316
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,590
Just as I expected.
317
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,220
Oh, but he did happily talk about
318
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,350
how he became friends
with one of the kids in the village.
319
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,350
He might have heard something
from the old man.
320
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,180
Oh, I wonder about that.
321
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,970
What you mean you wonder about that?
322
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,430
We won’t know until we find the kid
and question him, won’t we?
323
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,600
But it seems like there’s no need for us
to look for him or question him.
324
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,970
What?! Then, where is this guy!
325
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,300
Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto!
326
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,970
What?! Me?!
327
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,180
Yeah, there’s no mistake about that.
328
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,890
You’re Naruto Uzumaki?
329
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,470
Huh?
330
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,010
We want you to
talk with us for a bit.
331
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,720
On a checkerboard night
332
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,350
when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
333
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,720
I just can’t come out and say,
“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
334
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,890
Suggestively
335
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,640
Spat at that beloved face!!
Mister Cricket
336
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,470
The Trombone gradually going off-key
337
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,930
While on the sweaty center stage
does bug me.
338
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,970
But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel
in my undeveloped chest,
339
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,180
I wonder if it’s from
that coke I just drank?
340
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,850
I wonder what kind of interrogation
Naruto is undergoing?
341
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,550
I guess they would use
Regressive Hypnosis or something.
342
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,680
What’s Regressive Hypnosis?
343
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,590
It’s a Jutsu to draw out
subconscious memories.
344
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,510
Then Naruto might know something
even with his bad memory.
345
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Hmm. I wonder about that.
346
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,140
Well, this Old Man Genno sounds
like he was pretty tricky…
347
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,220
Wait, why are you here anyway?
348
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,470
Next time: “The Anbu Gives Up?
Naruto's Recollection”
//%
1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,080
Connecting old words
that have been used up
2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,990
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts
3
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,290
That day's faint wind blows away
4
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,450
at the castle ruins of yesterday
5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,620
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment
6
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,160
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?
7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,040
That's why it must be good-bye
8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left
9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,330
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything
10
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:19,000
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears
11
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:28,990
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away
12
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,410
It’s close.
13
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,910
That’s strange.
14
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,160
There hasn’t been even
one trap set for a while…
15
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,200
Shikamaru, what do you think?
16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,790
We’re being underestimated.
17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,410
Those guys think the only one
following them is that big guy.
18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,990
They don’t need to set
a trap on their man.
19
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,040
How dare they underestimate us!
20
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,870
It seems you’re right.
21
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,620
We are being
completely  underestimated.
22
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,990
However, this is our chance.
23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,990
Yeah… We’ll take them by surprise.
24
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,080
Your Opponent is Me!
25
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,790
That Jirobo is late.
26
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,990
No, he’s already here.
27
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,990
Aw, c’mon, what took you so long?
28
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,990
Sorry.
29
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,160
It took time to eat the scums’ Chakra.
30
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,750
Hey fatso, don’t you dare drag!
31
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,700
Hurry up and carry that coffin…
32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,830
That’s your job, you vulgar swine.
33
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
I know.
34
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,120
What, Jirobo…
You’re awfully easygoing today.
35
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,540
What do you mean?
36
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,750
I’m just saying I’m not handing you
the coffin.
37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,120
Because you’re not Jirobo!
38
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,790
This time let me do it.
39
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,990
Sakon, Tayuya, you guys go ahead!
40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,540
Jirobo always corrects
Tayuya’s choice of words.
41
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,370
Heh, I see.
42
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,950
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net.
43
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,990
You!
44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,870
Ninja Art: Spiral Spider Web
45
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,450
Naruto!
46
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,910
Now Kiba, Akamaru!
47
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,410
He shouldn’t be able to
move in mid-air.
48
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,200
Fang Over Fang!
49
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,790
I won’t let you get away!
50
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,990
That’s my line.
51
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,330
Look at your feet.
52
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,660
You!
53
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,990
It’s too soon for you to think
you captured us with a thing like this!
54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,830
Shut up!
55
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,160
C’mon, what the hell is
that fatso doing, dammit!
56
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,660
It was a mistake to leave
behind the weakest of us, after all.
57
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,540
Got it.
58
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,540
– Neji! 					– What?!
59
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,250
Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji…
60
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,950
Even though we’ve followed the plan,
it’s no good.
61
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,540
I’m going to cocoon you.
62
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,620
Damn!
63
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,040
Damn it! Damn it!
64
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,540
What’s with this thread?! It won’t cut.
65
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,410
It’s useless.
66
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,990
My thread is so strong that
even if two elephants pulled away,
67
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,990
it wouldn’t break.
68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,410
Shadow Clone… Interesting.
69
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,500
The thread is sticking…
70
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,750
This stickiness is probably made
71
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,370
by mixing Chakra with
his special body fluid.
72
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,990
Moreover, this strength. Even after
it’s been released from his hands…
73
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,620
Chakra’s continuously flowing
in the thread.
74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,790
It’s impossible…
The level of the Jutsu is unrealistic.
75
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,750
Calm down… Just calm down…
76
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,540
my Chakra.
77
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,290
Ninja Art:
Gum Style Spider Thread.
78
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,830
It’s a different color than
the thread from before.
79
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,790
What’s he gonna do?
80
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,830
It’s quickly solidifying, huh…
81
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,790
You are the first one,
so it’s like a little entertainment.
82
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,000
Now I’ll play a game to see
which of you is the real one.
83
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,660
What did you say?!
84
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,250
First is…you at the end.
85
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,950
Naruto!
86
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,450
It was a clone, huh.
Well, this one next!
87
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,330
What a lucky guy.
88
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,080
Next, I’ll do two at a time.
The odds are 2 to 1.
89
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,040
This guy has a great luck,
but it's either one or the other now!
90
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,700
Turns out he made it to the last.
91
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,790
Well, it was fun as a game,
but now the game’s over.
92
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,990
Die!
93
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,330
The first one is done.
94
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,910
What?!
95
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,080
I see, the real body made
its shadow clones get caught,
96
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,540
and hid himself and
waited for a chance, huh.
97
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,750
For a small fish like that to make
such a plan in those circumstances...
98
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,750
You're not too bad…but …
99
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,370
You’re at the end of the line. Die!
100
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,990
What?!
101
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,160
Naruto, your stall was helpful.
102
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,370
Neji!
103
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,990
You… How…?!
104
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,990
Substance with Chakra base…
105
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,990
It’s meaningless in front
of Gentle Fist
106
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,410
that destroys by pouring
Chakra through.
107
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,250
That guy’s Jutsu…
108
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,950
Evidently I’m the only one
who can fight it.
109
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,990
Go!
110
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,000
I’ll take care of this.
111
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,620
What’s wrong? Hey, Akamaru.
112
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,540
Apparently, this guy’s stronger
than the fatso before.
113
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,410
Quite a bit stronger.
114
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,200
If we’re not prepared for
“one person, one kill,”
115
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,790
then it’s not going to work out.
116
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,160
That’s what you said earlier.
117
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,080
Yeah, that’s right.
118
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,830
Plus, we won’t be able to catch up
with Sasuke if we stall here.
119
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,990
Choji hasn’t come back either.
120
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,870
The reason we’re doing this
121
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,160
is because of the mission
to bring back Sasuke.
122
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,990
But that’s not all.
123
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,120
What we are after and trying
to protect is the bond
124
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,990
of the Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
125
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,160
Do you remember Iruka’s words
at the Third Hokage’s funeral?
126
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:21,450
Iruka Sensei, why do people risk
their lives for others?
127
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,620
When someone dies,
128
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,080
they depart with their past,
present and future.
129
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,370
Many people die on missions
or at war.
130
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,990
And their death is surprisingly
unceremonious…they simply die.
131
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,990
Hayate was one of those people.
132
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,910
Those who die have dreams
and goals, too…
133
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,160
But everyone has things that
are equally important.
134
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,200
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers,
the people of their village,
135
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,250
the people important to you.
136
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,200
The connection to the people
you trust and help mutually,
137
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,790
the people important to you
from the day you were born.
138
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,410
And the thread that
connects you and your people
139
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,580
gets stronger through time.
140
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,830
It’s not a theory.
141
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,120
That’s what a person does
as the thread is established
142
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,700
because they’re important to you…
143
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,250
Look, Sasuke is heading
towards Orochimaru.
144
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,990
We can’t let Orochimaru get
a hold of someone from our village.
145
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,660
Absolutely not.
146
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,990
And…
147
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,080
Naruto…
148
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,160
Your eyes are better than mine.
149
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,870
Right now, Sasuke is…
150
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,990
in the darkness.
151
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,540
Hurry up and go!
I’ll catch up with you all!
152
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,950
Gotcha!
153
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,410
Okay! Let’s go!
154
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,990
You along with Choji,
be sure to catch up!
155
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,700
Yeah…
156
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,250
Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up!
157
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,580
Heh…think I’ll let them get away?!
158
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,830
Byakugan!
159
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,990
Here it comes!
160
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,540
This guy’s pretty good…
161
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,410
Neji!
162
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,990
That’s Neji all right!
163
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,250
Not yet…
I won’t let you escape that easily!
164
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,700
I won’t let you go any further from here!
165
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,290
It’s useless.
166
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,790
Well, that’s fine.
167
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,450
It seems you’re the strongest
out of the lot.
168
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,200
Aw man, now I wanna play…
169
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,870
It’s such a waste if
a game isn't played little by little.
170
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,620
For starters,
I’ll play and kill you in three minutes.
171
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,200
I got you.
172
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,990
You’re pretty good at handling Chakra
and you’ve got sharp eyes.
173
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,830
You release Chakra from
the Chakra points in your hands
174
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,540
like a sharp needle.
175
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,580
You see the thin part of the thread
with Chakra running through it, and attack.
176
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,410
I see, I’ve heard from Lord Orochimaru…
177
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,990
This is what’s called Gentle Fist, isn’t it?
178
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,830
But if you can’t use
those annoying hands,
179
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,120
they can’t cut my threads either.
180
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,990
Man, games. The instant you know
the rules of engagement,
181
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,450
they’re no longer interesting.
182
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,660
It’s only been a minute,
but I’m already tired of you.
183
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,660
Die!
184
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,870
Ninja Art:
Gum Style Spider Thread
185
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,120
What?!
186
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,990
How did he…?!
187
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,660
I’ll explain, specially to you.
188
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,000
It’s not just my hands
189
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,200
I can release Chakra from
all of the Chakra points on my body.
190
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,700
And it’s game over.
191
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,990
Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.
192
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:32,660
Once in a long while, once in a while
193
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,250
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams
194
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,540
Look like a mountain
195
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,910
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha
196
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,410
The remnants of a person crying
197
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,450
Look like a mountain
198
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,120
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
199
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,990
This is my victory pose, round and around
(round around)
200
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,290
Shake shake shake
Let’s look
201
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,540
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
202
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,870
Look like a mountain
203
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,990
Look like a mountain
204
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,620
Look like a mountain
205
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,950
Look like a mountain
206
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,830
The attack on his Chakra points
is ineffective.
207
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,700
On top of that,
208
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,200
he switched to a long-distance attack
to avoid Gentle Fist.
209
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,950
This guy blocks my every move
and he quickly reads my hands.
210
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,990
This is bad. I’m at a disadvantage
if the fight drags on.
211
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,250
And if he noticed that, then…
212
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,990
Next time: “360 Degrees of Vision:
The Byakugan’s Blind Spot!”
//%
1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,460
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,960
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,590
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,170
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,590
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,590
Right here right now (Burn)
7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,250
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles
8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,090
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?
9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:44,380
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map
10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,750
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,050
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!
12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,630
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,210
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them
14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,710
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe
15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,340
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way
16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,920
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,630
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!
18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,050
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!
19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,420
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
20
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,090
Hey…don’t you want to see it?
21
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,790
It’s about time.
22
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,920
What?
23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,130
You know what I’m talking about.
24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,880
Kakashi Sensei’s…real face!
25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,590
What are you doing?!
26
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,710
That’s stupid!
27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,420
I’m not interested.
28
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,250
Today’s mission is over,
so I’m going home…
29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,210
Yeah, I agree…
30
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,090
Aw geez… It sounds like fun.
31
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,500
Maybe he has…
32
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,130
lips like cod roe?
33
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,000
Lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,
34
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,170
lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,
lips like cod roe…
35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,710
Take one more push!
36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,750
Or maybe a buckteeth?!
37
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,250
Buckteeth?!
38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,000
Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?!
Buckteeth?!
39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,630
Gotta See! Gotta Know!
Kakashi Sensei's True Face!
40
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,670
But this is rare…
41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,250
Here you go! Thanks for waiting!
42
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,050
All three of you treating me…
43
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,130
Snow might fall--
44
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,630
– Great success!
– Great success!
45
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,880
You know what I mean?
46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,960
Here! Thanks for waiting!
47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,790
All three of you treating me…
48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,340
Snow might fall today?
49
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,790
Or if it’s not that…
50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,250
– Great success!
– Great success!
51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,670
Maybe it’s that…
52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,670
Here! Thanks for waiting!
53
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,460
All three of you treating me…
54
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,840
Snow might fall today?
55
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,790
Or if it’s not that…
56
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,960
are you guys up to something…
or not?
57
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,340
– Great success!
– Great success!
58
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,420
…like that.
59
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,380
Or if it’s not that,
are you guys up to something?
60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,090
Wh-Wh-What are you saying?!
61
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,800
K-Kakashi Sensei, we’re celebrating
your release from the hospital!
62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,960
N-Now! P-P-P-lease eat, eat!
63
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,790
All right…
Then I’ll eat it without hesitation.
64
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,840
Thank you for waiting.
65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,500
The pork slices are our treat.
66
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,790
Thanks for the treat.
67
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,090
Oh! Sasuke…
What a coincidence!
68
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,460
Get away! Ino Pig!
69
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Wha--?!
70
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,790
Aw man! I can’t see at all!
71
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,340
I’m finished! That was good…
72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,340
– So fast! 					– So fast!
73
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,670
Huh? Something wrong?
74
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,590
N-Nothing’s wrong.
75
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,300
Hey!
76
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,920
– Huh? 					– Huh?
77
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,250
– Wow! I'm really curious!
– Wow! I'm really curious!
78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,340
Now, I will not allow myself
to be denied a glimpse of him!
79
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,790
But how are you
going to see it?
80
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,130
That’s…
81
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,500
We’ll see it somehow…
82
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,590
I’m asking you how! You idiot!
83
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,630
Then, then, do you have
a good plan, Sakura?
84
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,790
That’s…
85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,960
We’ll follow by completely marking him.
86
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,300
If we do that, he’ll eventually
take his mask off.
87
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,630
Sasuke, you are really bright.
88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,590
What’s that big deal?
That was so average!
89
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,790
Did you say something?
90
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,790
Well, that's fine.
91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,670
What's Kakashi Sensei doing?
92
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,630
I’m disappointed in him.
93
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,790
He noticed us!
94
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,790
Stupid Naruto!
We were found because of you!
95
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,710
I tell you it’s not my fault!
96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,710
What?!
97
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,130
I-It’s being made into a movie?!
98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I’m going to go buy
an advance ticket.
99
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,840
Hey, he’s begun to move!
100
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,250
We’ll follow his track!
101
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,670
Yeah!
102
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,960
What? He's gone!
103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,840
Darn, he got away…
104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,790
Darn it, where did he go…?
105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,790
What are you guys doing?
106
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,130
Do you guys have
some business with me?
107
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,000
– N-Not really…
– N-Not really…
108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,790
Hey, how did he find us out?
109
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,840
Isn’t it because there
are too many of us?
110
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,000
If the presence is erased,
the number of people shouldn’t matter!
111
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,790
Or…have you forgotten the Jutsu?
Sakura…
112
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,590
That’s you!
113
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,050
It will be good training to shadow him.
114
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,590
From now on,
we’ll go about it individually.
115
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,130
Y-Yeah, let’s just leave Naruto here!
116
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,790
What?!
117
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,790
And Junko then says…
“Oh, I am losing you.”
118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,750
What? What?
119
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,340
He got away…
120
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,420
Clumsy as usual…
121
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,920
You idiot…
122
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,630
Sorry.
123
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,960
Gosh, what is Kakashi Sensei doing?
124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,630
He hasn’t moved for
such a long time…
125
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,380
No way!
126
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,790
Sasuke! How did it go?!
127
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,210
No more shadowing.
128
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,670
Off we go!
129
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,670
Today’s mission is to help at a farm.
130
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,090
The mission itself is not a big deal.
131
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,050
We’re definitely going to look at it…
132
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,630
– Kakashi Sensei’s real face!
– Kakashi Sensei’s real face!
133
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,790
What’s the matter?
134
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,790
You guys seem to have
lots of energy today.
135
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
– I have lots of energy!
– I'm ready to go!
136
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,130
Oh, that’s excellent.
137
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,090
I’ve finally found you…
138
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,050
Kakashi Hatake!
139
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,550
Kakashi…
140
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,340
It has been a long while,
141
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,920
but I will settle
my long-standing grudge!
142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,050
Boss, what is your grudge?
143
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,550
Fool! Have you forgotten?!
144
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,800
I cannot forget.
145
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,920
It happened in the spring
of three years ago…
146
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,250
No!
147
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,750
You don’t need to be that scared.
148
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,210
No!
149
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,550
Our boss says he has something
to talk to you about…
150
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,790
Your boss?!
151
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,710
I love you… Please marry me!
152
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,790
– Boss is so cool!
– Boss is so cool!
153
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,790
No…
154
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,790
There’s no need to be embarrassed.
155
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,630
You can be honest and
fly into my arms.
156
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,550
No…
157
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,920
Don’t worry.
Even though I look like this,
158
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,130
I have a tidy sum of money!
159
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,000
I am telling you, no!
160
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,960
What? You’re turning me down
in these surroundings?
161
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,790
When I say no, I mean no!
162
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,590
I made it such a romantic setting,
but why?
163
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,550
I don’t like what I don’t like!
164
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,670
Why don’t you stop it around there?
165
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,790
– Huh? 					– Huh?
166
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,800
Hey, the girl doesn’t like it
and no matter how you look at it,
167
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,050
you’re being rejected, buddy.
168
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,670
Yeah, yeah.
169
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,630
You're pretty gutsy.
170
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,340
Do you understand who we are?!
171
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,880
Are you challenging us, knowing that
we are the Moya Ninja Threesome…
172
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,790
fearsome enough to silence
a crying child?!
173
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,090
Moya Ninja? Never heard of it.
174
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,590
You don’t know Moya Ninja?!
175
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,790
How dare you make fools of us!
176
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,380
Who the hell are you?
177
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,800
It’s not worth enough to introduce, but…
178
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,250
Well, my name is Kakashi Hatake.
179
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,790
– You’re introducing yourself!
– You’re introducing yourself!
180
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,090
Hey you…
181
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,790
You’re going to regret it.
182
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,000
For getting in the way of
someone's romance!
183
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,550
Romance?
184
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,300
Isn’t it just an annoying,
one-sided love?
185
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,800
Enough!
186
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,300
Men! We’re going to attack!
187
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,090
– Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
188
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,550
4…3…2…1…
189
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,590
– Hustle! Hustle!
– Hustle! Hustle!
190
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,420
Please! Somebody help me!
191
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,790
Hey! I can't stand heights!
192
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,840
I’ll take you back to the village.
193
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Stop talking! Hey!
194
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,960
Hey, quit sighing!
What, are you just leaving us here?!
195
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,340
That's how it went…
196
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,340
– Don’t be so proud!
– Don't be so proud!
197
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,590
– You lost! 					– You lost!
198
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,750
So it means revenge from
three years ago!
199
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,800
Boss has become stronger
in the last three years,
200
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,710
and he’s going to beat him up
in a face-to-face match!
201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,380
That’s so dramatic!
202
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,590
Fool! Who would take such risk?!
203
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,380
Huh?
204
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,550
If we’re going to do it,
205
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,550
we’ll do it stealthily from
the shadows! Stealthily.
206
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,210
– D-Dirty! 					– D-Dirty!
207
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,880
Welcome!
208
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,790
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
209
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,050
Welcome!
210
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,420
Incredible!
211
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,340
Looks delicious!
212
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,750
How extravagant.
213
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,790
Please take your time…
214
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,300
Kakashi…
215
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,000
Now eat, this will be
your last dinner party.
216
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,750
That meal contains
a tasteless and odorless medicine
217
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,050
that causes uncontrollable hiccups.
218
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,750
Just keep on having
the ceaseless hiccups and die suffering!
219
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,750
It’s a fitting end for you!
220
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,000
Something wrong?
221
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,000
Not one of you has
even laid chopsticks on the food.
222
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,380
Not really, but why don’t you,
Kakashi Sensei, hurry up and eat?
223
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,380
Well, I'm on a diet.
224
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,920
Figured he'd say something like that.
225
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,960
Then I’ll strip off that mask
if it kills me!
226
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,800
My hands slipped…
227
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,460
How could you!
228
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,790
Oh, sorry, sorry, I unintentionally…
229
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,790
– What do you mean "unintentionally"?!
– What do you mean "unintentionally"?!
230
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,960
What a pity! The meal…
231
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,590
– How could he do such a thing?!
– How could he do such a thing?!
232
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,800
Hey, what’s the next move?
233
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,790
Don’t worry. I have an idea.
234
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,630
– An idea? 					– An idea?
235
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
I see, this is pretty good thinking
for Sasuke.
236
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,550
A person would normally
take off the mask here.
237
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,050
Never mind that.
Just be quiet, you idiot!
238
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,000
Kakashi, you will die here!
239
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,790
From this needle on the blowpipe arrow,
240
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,920
coated with medicine I prepared
that will make you laugh uncontrollably…
241
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,790
You’ll die laughing…
242
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,550
That is the fitting way for you…
243
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,460
Darn…
244
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,790
I wanted to see it too,
but this is a hot spring…
245
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,710
But I want to see!
246
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,000
Kakashi Sensei!
Aren’t you ready yet?
247
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,340
All right, I’m coming in now.
248
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,920
I do want to see it!
249
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,090
Here he comes!
250
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,050
Great!
251
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,800
Oh, I can’t see at all!
252
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,670
Thanks for waiting.
I'll just soak for a little while.
253
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,340
– Why is it like this?!
– Why is it like this?!
254
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,090
Now!
255
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,790
Huh? Something wrong?
256
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,340
And slowly, I sink in.
257
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,630
What the--?!
258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,790
What happened?
I want to know!
259
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,670
What in the world is
Kakashi Sensei thinking? Huh?
260
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,790
Darn, I’m completely flushed… Huh?
261
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,250
– Our clothes are gone!
– Our clothes are gone!
262
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,380
Please come again!
Please come again!
263
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Thank you for coming!
264
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,210
Please come again!
Please come again!
265
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,750
Crap…I’m going to
definitely defeat you, Kakashi Hatake.
266
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,710
But it was great that
we brought spare clothes.
267
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,210
I wonder who took them away…?
Our clothes!
268
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,790
All right,
each of you work at your own posts.
269
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,590
Now, break up.
270
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,130
I can't stand it anymore…
271
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,420
I have too much stress stored inside.
272
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,380
I’m almost at the end of
my patience as well…
273
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,630
Sasuke…actually, me too…
274
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,130
Then, it’s the last resort!
275
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,050
– Last resort?
– Last resort?
276
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,210
What is this?
277
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,550
Can’t you see? It’s Shinobi outfit.
278
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,710
When did you get this ready?
279
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,250
Well, well, never mind that,
never mind that.
280
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,670
What do you do with this?
281
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,670
We’ll strip away the mask.
Even if we have to use force!
282
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,380
Darn Kakashi…
283
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,710
Boss! Look at that!
284
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,090
Hey, Kakashi Hatake!
285
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,340
Hey, what are you guys up to?
286
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,790
W-What are you talking about?
We are simply Ninja.
287
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,130
It is not that we want to see
what is behind your mask--!
288
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,340
Fool! Don’t say unnecessary things!
289
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,420
That’s…!
290
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,050
Boss! There’s somebody else besides you
who holds a grudge on Kakashi!
291
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,630
Now is the chance!
292
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,000
Right! Let’s go!
293
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,790
– Right! 					– Right!
294
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,880
Stop right there!
295
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,880
Kakashi! It’s time for you
to pay for your crime!
296
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,880
You shall die!
297
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,210
With this medicine I prepared
that will make you cry… What?!
298
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,380
Oh, just when I thought how long
you guys were going to sneak around…
299
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,090
you finally come out.
300
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,050
Ah, well, you know…
301
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,380
But before that,
Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!
302
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,380
Why are you guys dressed like that?
303
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,960
Huh?! Well, yeah, so…
304
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,750
Oh no…
305
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,790
We have to make up an explanation,
whatever it is!
306
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,790
Caught you!
307
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,590
We were well aware that
you three were targeting Kakashi Sensei!
308
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,170
What?! Then our plot was exposed
from the beginning!
309
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,300
Of course!
This was a trap to lure you guys out!
310
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,960
We caught you off guard!
311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,710
So we were completely caught
in the trap.
312
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,790
Darn! We underestimated you,
thinking it was kids!
313
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,920
I never heard that story!
314
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,790
Nice, Sakura!
315
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,750
I don’t quite get what’s happening,
but oh well…
316
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,420
– Please forgive us!
– Please forgive us!
317
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,790
There’s no use talking…
318
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,130
– O-Oh no! 					– S-Stop!
319
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,790
It’s the same as three years ago!
320
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,710
This time, we're hung by just one rope,
combined with the same movement.
321
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,380
By the way, who are you guys?
322
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,000
– And he doesn’t even remember us!
– And he doesn’t even remember us!
323
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,840
Hey, Kakashi Sensei.
324
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,380
Yeah?
325
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,880
What is behind that mask?
326
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,790
What? You wanted to see
what’s behind this mask?
327
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,590
Yeah!
328
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,630
Then you should have said
that from the beginning…
329
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,880
Well, can you show us?
330
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,630
I don’t mind…
331
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,460
What the--?!
332
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,050
Sure thing.
333
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,790
All right…
334
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,590
Is it like cod roe?
335
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,130
Buckteeth?
336
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,000
Or a tiny mouth?
337
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,250
Behind this mask…
338
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,170
– Behind that mask…
– Behind that mask…
339
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,460
There happens to be another mask!
340
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,000
– What?! 					– What?!
341
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,800
What--?!
342
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,800
What in the world is that ?!
343
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,750
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage
344
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,000
Always I feel it
the precious time with you
345
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,170
On your still shoulder
346
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,800
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow
347
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,550
The city lights are like pieces of stars
348
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,300
That hold us together
349
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:57,920
“Each one of us glows differently,”
350
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,750
you say laughingly
351
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:06,710
but you look most dazzling
352
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,630
Like a comet,
353
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:17,790
like the rainbow after the storm
354
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:24,800
You bring light into my heart
355
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:35,250
Being lost can be the answer
356
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:44,090
Let’s promise we won’t cheat
357
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,170
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.
358
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,250
Begging your pardon!
Begging your pardon!
359
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,250
I was born and raised in the Leaf Village
in the Land of Fire.
360
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,500
My given name is Naruto,
and the surname is Uzumaki.
361
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,170
People call me--
362
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,420
"The No. 1 Hyperactive
Knucklehead Ninja"!
363
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm not "the No. 1 Hyperactive
Knucklehead Ninja"!
364
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,790
What's this
you've been practicing?
365
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,500
We're going to meet with
Boss Wasabi.
366
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,420
A proper first greeting's important!
367
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,800
Next time: "Mission:
Help an Old Friend in the Land of Tea!"
//%
1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,810
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,560
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,350
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,850
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,390
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,390
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:55,690
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:06,480
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:16,060
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,230
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,230
The Enemy of the Byakugan
12
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,390
They blew up…
They blew up and died!
13
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,810
As I expected, I’m not sad.
14
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,810
You really can’t hold funerals
feeling like this, huh…
15
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,850
Four of them are still alive.
16
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,940
Can’t be! After being hit
by my Lightning Fang…
17
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,600
No…
18
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,810
If you say so, it has to be true.
19
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,270
One…is troublesome…
20
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,150
The enemy was nearby…
But I couldn’t see anything.
21
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,020
It’s strange…
22
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,270
Even if it’s the Hidden Mist Jutsu,
23
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,440
my Byakugan should be able
to see through it.
24
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,900
Byakugan!
25
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,400
For sure this time…
26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,390
I can see it!
27
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,230
Southwest 52 degrees 2!
28
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,060
Southeast 12 degrees 3!
29
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,390
Southeast 8 degrees 1!
30
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,350
Northwest 24 degrees 11!
31
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,190
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
32
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,390
Let’s go!
33
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,600
Leaf Hurricane!
34
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,440
No way!
35
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,810
Why?!
36
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,690
U-zu-ma-ki Barrage!
37
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,690
I missed!
38
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,480
H-Help me!
39
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,520
Bushy Brow…?
40
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,270
Th-The enemy disappeared!
41
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,190
It can’t be…
The false images with Chakra Networks?
42
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,020
One at the middle of the cliff,
one at the bottom of the cliff,
43
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,900
one on the right, one on the left.
44
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
We can’t hold funerals,
45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,900
but I’ll take care of them
without leaving any trace.
46
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,350
Thunder Funeral: Feast of Lightning!
47
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,440
The corpses are warm.
48
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,150
We’re strong…you and I.
49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,020
No, it’s you.
50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,190
Ranmaru, you’re strong.
With you I’m also strong.
51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,190
Wait… They aren’t dead yet.
They’re just unconscious.
52
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,730
They’re stubborn.
53
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,980
Okay, if grilling doesn’t work,
then let’s chop them.
54
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,230
Flesh and even bone…
I’ll crush them nicely.
55
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,770
Ranmaru…! Are you all right?!
56
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,390
Hang in there, Ranmaru!
57
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,600
Ranmaru…!
58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I’m okay.
59
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,690
Raiga…
60
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,310
This person…is still unconscious.
61
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,900
What did you say?
62
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,600
It’s amazing…
63
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,480
He is fighting
only with muscle memory.
64
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,390
It’s a nice face.
lt burns into my heart.
65
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,150
Let’s hold a funeral for him…
66
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,020
I am sure it will be one
that will make me cry!
67
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,900
From the right!
68
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
What’s with this guy…?
69
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,190
He’s hard to read. The moves…
70
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,390
But for your sake, Raiga,
I’ll do my best.
71
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,940
Together, okay!
72
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,730
Left!
73
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,390
Right!
74
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,190
From the front! Jump! Now!
75
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,650
You…you…you!
76
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,690
What?
77
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,270
How can this guy…
get to this point?
78
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,600
B-Bushy Brows…
79
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,730
Lee…
Could he have lost consciousness…?
80
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,850
Tenten! Neji!
81
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,270
Raiga! Turn around!
82
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,390
What…? That voice right now…?
83
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,390
Wha–?!
84
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,770
Raiga!
85
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,230
Ranmaru!
86
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,650
This is…
87
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,440
Neji…
88
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,020
Ranmaru!
89
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,690
Move!
90
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,020
Huh? Somehow…it felt like
I was fighting in my dreams…
91
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,440
Ranmaru…
92
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,190
You!
93
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,730
Heh! Naruto Uzumaki arrives!
94
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Naruto…
95
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,940
Just die already…
96
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,270
Hey! I have something
I want to ask you!
97
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,100
You… I heard you’re one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
98
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,850
So what if I was?!
99
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,150
You know Zabuza, right?!
100
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,150
You also know…
one called Kisame, right?!
101
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,020
I…hate them!
Who wants to remember them?!
102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,020
I hate you too!
103
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,690
Then!
104
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,770
I’ll make you tell me by force!
105
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,390
A clone?!
106
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,020
You… You’re weaker
than a moment ago.
107
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,020
Wh-What…?
108
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,520
Lightning Ball!
109
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,520
Damn…
110
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,150
Huh, you are tough…
111
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,940
Lightning Ball!
112
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,390
Seconds, please…
113
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,150
Grandma Sansho?
114
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,560
What’s wrong?
115
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,560
Oh my. That’s bad lightning.
116
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,190
It was flashing like that too when
Karashi went to the village.
117
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,270
Oh my…that light is like poison…
118
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,940
Naruto!
119
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,480
It’s not…working at all.
120
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,940
I’m not going to
remember your smile!
121
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,770
Die!
122
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,350
Ranmaru…where are you?
123
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,400
What is in this bag…?
124
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,060
Byakugan!
125
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,310
There’s…in here…
126
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,850
Could it be?
127
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,020
This powder was…
hiding the Chakra Networks?
128
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,150
It’s even creating the Chakra Network!
129
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,440
Naruto!
Do the Shadow Clone Jutsu!
130
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,520
But he saw all the shadow clones…
131
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,020
Don’t worry.
His eyes are right here!
132
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,390
Ranmaru! I’m gonna come save you
after I defeat this guy!
133
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,390
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
134
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,100
Come bring it on!
135
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,600
Lightning Ball!
136
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,770
What? Was the one before a lucky hit?
137
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,190
Stop messing around.
All I have to do is defeat you all, right?!
138
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,270
Let’s go!
139
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,270
We’re not done yet!
140
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,440
You…
141
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,390
At this rate…my Chakra will…
142
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,020
The mist…
The Hidden Mist Jutsu is fading away…
143
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,390
Damn! I’ll finish them off at once!
144
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,650
Damn!
145
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,850
I am not going to let you get away!
146
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,520
Wait!
147
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,390
Ninja Art: Boulder Avalanche.
148
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,060
Naruto!
149
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,270
Naruto…
150
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,650
Did you see that…?!
151
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,900
Yeah, I saw it!
152
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,480
Prepare yourself!
153
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,060
Stop it!
154
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,730
I can’t stop!
155
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,310
I…did it.
156
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,480
This is…Raiga’s eye…?
157
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,270
Such a big eye ball!
158
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,230
Huh?
159
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,100
You’re wrong…
lt’s a human being!
160
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,560
Huh…?!
161
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,940
In my dream…
162
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,270
I guess you were the one
I was fighting against.
163
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,520
It wasn’t me…
lt was Raiga and me together…
164
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,020
Together…?
165
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,650
Always…since that time…
166
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,560
Don’t act like you’re asleep.
You are going to die…
167
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,150
Don’t move!
168
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,020
There is a spy in this village
who snuck into the Hidden Mist Village…
169
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,150
We came to kill those guys, but…
170
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:41,310
I got confused about who I had to kill.
That’s why I am doing it randomly…
171
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,310
Wh-What are you saying?
172
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,980
It’s fine…
lf I am going to be killed by you.
173
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Huh…?
Why is it fine for me to kill you…?
174
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,390
You were…always crying…
175
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,390
Huh? Me…cry?
176
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,100
In your heart…
seeking the meaning of living.
177
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,560
I was always watching…you.
178
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
What…are you?
179
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,390
I am the same as you…
living is painful.
180
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,020
I don’t understand
the meaning of living.
181
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,390
Because of my sickness,
I couldn’t go outside…
182
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,600
Shunned by everyone,
183
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,520
all I could do was to take
a peek of the world from this blanket…
184
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,770
But …if with my death,
185
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,980
if you are able to feel
the meaning of life even a little…
186
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,810
My life was not needed
from the beginning.
187
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,150
Please…
188
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,020
Are you…alone?
189
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,310
Come with me.
190
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,650
From now on,
you and I are two as one.
191
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,230
From that day on,
I became Raiga’s eyes and ears.
192
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,850
Raiga became my hands and feet.
193
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,230
The outside world that I dashed
into for the very first time…
194
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,400
it was filled with things
I had never seen or heard before.
195
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,230
It was fun.
196
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,980
Whenever and wherever,
I was with Raiga.
197
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,600
No matter when it was,
198
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,390
there wasn’t a time
that we were separated.
199
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,390
We were trying to find the meaning of life
by living for each other.
200
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,810
We were convinced that
was the meaning to living.
201
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,270
That’s why…
202
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,850
If Raiga is not around,
203
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,060
I no longer have the power
to live by myself.
204
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,390
I’ve lost the purpose to live…
205
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,980
Do you have someone
precious to you?
206
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,650
I want to protect
someone important to me…
207
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,350
I want to make his dream come true,
and that’s my dream.
208
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,310
Often people have it wrong…
209
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,560
mistakenly believing that showing mercy
to an enemy is kindness.
210
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,350
They spare the foe
whose life is in their hands.
211
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,020
It’s not mercy to me at all…
212
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:43,390
Do you know the agony of just living
without dreams and being unwanted?
213
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,900
What are you saying?
214
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:54,560
Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.
You’ve taken away my reason for living.
215
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,390
I no longer need to live.
216
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,980
Don’t say such stupid things.
217
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,900
Naruto… Please kill me!
218
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,600
Huh?
219
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,400
What are you doing?
220
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,900
Now, quickly.
221
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,310
Why are you hesitating…?
222
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,150
With my arms and legs torn apart,
I have no means to resist, you know.
223
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,560
You should carry out your mission….
224
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,230
Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.
225
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,770
Our mission is to force out
the Kurosuki Family from this village…
226
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,980
Without Raiga, he cannot be
of any threat to this village.
227
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,390
The problem right now is that
228
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,310
the Kurosuki Family members
have lost their leadership.
229
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,390
Once the hoop comes off,
we don’t know what they will do.
230
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,390
For this mission…
this is the finishing touch.
231
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,940
Yeah, but what are we
going to do with him?
232
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,650
Is he a villain worth tying up?
233
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,440
No, he is not.
234
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,390
He might kill himself, right?
235
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,020
Once the mission is over,
we will come save you right away…
236
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,560
A Chakra Sealing tag?
237
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,390
We can’t help it.
He is an enemy, after all…
238
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,230
We should assume he has other Jutsu.
Just in case!
239
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:41,390
So many things happen
on this endless road, huh?
240
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:52,900
Although you’re strong-willed,
your voice wavered on the phone today
241
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:04,350
What dreams did you chase to get here?
242
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:16,390
Even I have times when
I just don’t understand, baby
243
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:27,850
When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
244
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:39,390
Even on nights when we’re apart,
I’ll be close to you
245
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,230
I’ll be close to you
246
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,940
Rokusuke and the others
went back to the village,
247
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,390
so I say the mission is complete.
248
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,390
Except Lee.
249
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh, oh yeah.
250
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,060
Bushy Brow said he was
going to straighten Karashi’s spirit.
251
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,270
I wonder if it’s going to be
that easy.
252
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,440
It seems like
there will be some trouble.
253
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,390
Hey, why are you saying that?!
254
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,060
No, not Karashi, but this weather.
255
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,940
Next episode:
“The Dark Creeping Clouds”
256
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,690
I see. There’s going to be a storm.
//%
1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,620
Hey boys, listen up!
2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,370
Humans aren’t such a big deal
3
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,160
Who needs tomorrow anyway,
4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,490
so don’t hide your fists
5
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,500
You’re not old enough
6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,950
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
7
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,410
Hey boys, you’re the only ones
8
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,910
who can pull the trigger in your heart
9
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,370
All the kids said
10
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,370
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,580
awesome world right at this moment,
12
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,250
All the kids said
13
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,080
Don’t forget every truth or lie
14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,700
All the kids said
15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,160
We’re way too young to die
16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,000
In this empty town lined with empty faces
17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,330
All the kids took off
18
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,750
into this windless night
19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,290
Because they want to change something
20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,540
Sasuke!
21
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,410
You punk!
22
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,120
What’s with…this guy?
23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
Why…?
24
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,500
Damn it…
25
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,950
Is this the best you’ve got…?
26
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,950
If this is all you’ve got,
I still don’t need to use that…
27
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,490
What?
28
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,750
You haven’t realized it?
I…haven’t used my Sharingan.
29
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,290
Don’t mock me!
30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,950
You don’t have enough strength
or desire…
31
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,870
You are weak.
32
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,490
Why you are weak?
Because you don’t have enough…hatred.
33
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,580
If I kept playing comrade with you guys…
34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,790
I wouldn’t have…been able to get…
35
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,580
…this much power!
36
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,870
That’s right…I need …
37
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,700
Both power…and hatred…
in order to catch up with him.
38
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,490
Brothers:
Distance Among the Uchiha
39
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,410
Big Brother…I’ll get off.
40
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,490
Don’t push it…
41
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,250
Okay…
42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,660
Oh…
43
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
What’s up?
44
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,660
This is the place…
where Father works, right?
45
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,870
Yeah…The headquarters
of the Leaf Police Force.
46
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,580
I was curious about it from before,
47
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,450
but why’s the Uchiha Clan crest
on the Police Force mark?
48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,290
Oh… so you noticed, huh?
49
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,250
Of course…
50
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,490
Yeah…Let me see…
To put it simply…
51
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,080
it seems the previous generations
of the Uchiha Clan
52
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,040
set up and established the Police Force.
53
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,580
So they used their own crest for
the symbol mark of this organization.
54
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,620
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has always been
55
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,540
in charge of protecting
the public and the peace of this village.
56
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,830
The Uchiha crest is
a testament to the proud clan.
57
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,290
The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.
58
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,870
But even now, nearly all members
belong to this first force here.
59
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,490
and contribute to maintaining
peace in the village.
60
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Only even more exceptional Shinobi
can crack down on the crimes
61
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,410
committed by Shinobi, so…
62
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,750
Sure enough, father’s awesome!
63
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,580
Leaf Police Force
Are you going to enter
the Police Force, too?
64
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,410
Well…I’m not sure…
65
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,540
Why not?!
66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,490
When I grow up, I’m also going
to enter the Police Force, so!
67
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,490
Father’s also coming to
tomorrow’s entrance ceremony.
68
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,490
It’s the first step to my dream.
69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,790
That’s right.
70
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,490
You’re late…What were you doing?
71
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,410
Father…
72
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,490
I have something to talk to you about.
Come quickly.
73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,750
That's my boy.
74
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,660
You’ve come this far just half a year
after being promoted to Chunin.
75
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,410
About tomorrow’s special mission…
76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,500
I’ve decided to go with you, too.
77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,580
Tomorrow?
78
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,540
If you complete this mission, Itachi…
79
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,250
your entrance into
the Anbu Black Ops is almost assured!
80
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,490
You understand, right?
81
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,500
You don’t have to be so worried.
More importantly…
82
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,830
Umm… Father…
83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,370
Tomorrow’s my…
84
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,700
Tomorrow’s mission will be
a very important mission not just for you,
85
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,500
but for the Uchiha Clan!
86
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,120
I’m quitting tomorrow’s mission, after all.
87
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,160
What’re you doing talking insanity?!
88
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,490
You should know how important
a day tomorrow is!
89
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,450
I’m going to Sasuke’s Academy
entrance ceremony tomorrow…
90
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,580
The general rule is for relatives
to attend the Academy entrance ceremony.
91
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,120
There was the notice, right… Father?
92
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,490
I get it already.
93
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,450
I’ll go to the Academy…
94
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,910
Your left leg…
95
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,580
Be sure to ice it.
96
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,410
Right…
97
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,660
Big Brother… He’s so distant…
98
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,120
Entrance Ceremony
99
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,290
Everyone! Congratulations
on your entrance!
100
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,620
From here on, please work very hard
towards striving for the Shinobi path.
101
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,830
And I’d like you to bring further prosperity
to the Hidden Village in the Leaf.
102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,250
Gee… I remember
the time when Itachi entered.
103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Just what I’d expect from his brother.
104
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,790
Thank you for your help with both boys.
105
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
Oh, it’s nothing like that.
106
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,490
The first prodigy since the beginning
of the Academy…
107
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,660
There were no students
as exceptional as that boy.
108
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,490
That’s a bit too much praise.
109
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,660
Not at all…
110
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,450
I’m hopeful for you, too.
111
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,540
Become a fine Shinobi
like your big brother.
112
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,790
Yes.
113
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,620
Hey…That’s Uchiha, right?
114
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,290
Yeah.
115
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
I wonder…if he’s awesome, too.
116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,370
Hmm…Must be.
117
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,660
Recess at last! What a drag.
I’m still not used to this place…
118
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,490
You want some too, Shikamaru?
119
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,790
I mean, all of your recesses
have become meal times.
120
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,160
That’s my boy…
121
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,490
I’ve great confidence
you’ll make it great in Anbu.
122
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,660
This won’t do!
123
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,450
Won’t do!
124
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,790
I’ve got a long way…to go…
125
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,500
Really…
126
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,490
You should rest your body
on your days off at least.
127
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,490
You don’t have to push it.
128
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,700
I heard…that Big Brother graduated
from the Academy in just one year.
129
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,910
The times are different, then and now.
130
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,660
Besides, that kid is a bit special, so…
131
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,490
That’s my boy…
132
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,450
Now, I’m going to hand out
the report cards for the first half.
133
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,550
Taijutsu: 1st in class and academy
Ninjutsu: 1st in class and academy
lndividual rank: 1st in class and academy
Team rank: 1st in class and academy
134
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,790
Do a fine job in this vein like
your big brother.
135
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,870
Father… I wanted you to say,
“That’s my boy,” to me…
136
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,330
What did you say?
137
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,120
What do you mean you can’t participate
in the assembly tomorrow?!
138
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,490
You don’t understand your own position!
139
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,830
I’m setting out on a mission tomorrow.
140
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,750
What’re they doing this late
at night with the lights off?
141
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,500
What mission?!
142
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,410
I can’t say…
lt’s a top secret mission.
143
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,370
Itachi…You also have the role
of the pipe which connects the clan
144
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,200
with the keystone of the village.
145
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,250
You know that, don’t you?
146
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,790
Yeah…
147
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,580
Keep that well in mind!
And come to tomorrow’s assembly!
148
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,700
Sasuke…
149
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,450
Get to bed after
you’ve gone to the bathroom.
150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,540
Right…
151
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,750
What’re you doing hanging around
this late at night?
152
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,370
Get to bed!
153
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,620
Okay.
154
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,490
Report Card
155
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,580
Father only thinks about you, Big Brother…
156
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,580
Am I loathsome to you?
157
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,910
It’s okay.
158
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,910
It’s logical for Shinobi to be
ill-thought of by people, so…
159
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,910
That's not how I feel…
160
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,160
Brother's right.
I really do…think ill of him…
161
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,080
Excellence is not easy at all.
162
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,490
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant.
163
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,370
Even if you’re coveted
and sought after at first.
164
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,410
But, we only have each other
for siblings.
165
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,000
I will continue to exist with you
as a wall you must get over…
166
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,080
Even if I’m ill-thought of…
That’s what a big brother is.
167
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,200
Is Itachi home?!
168
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,200
I have something to
talk to you about. Come out!
169
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,490
Why’s everyone gathered here?
170
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,080
There are two people who didn’t come
to yesterday’s assembly.
171
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,490
Why didn’t you come?!
172
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,910
He didn’t go to the assembly Father
was talking about last night, after all.
173
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,120
I understand that when you enter Anbu,
174
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,490
you get roped into various
troublesome things.
175
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,660
Your father also said something
like that in your defense.
176
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,410
But for us, we don’t intend
to treat you special.
177
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,620
Understood. I shall be careful next time.
178
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,370
Now I’m going to have
to ask you to leave.
179
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,370
Right… But before that,
there’s a little more I want to ask you…
180
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:28,160
It’s about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself
into the Nakano River to kill himself.
181
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,830
Threw himself?!
182
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,790
The other person who didn’t come
to the assembly is that Shisui.
183
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,290
As I recall, you adored him
like a real older brother.
184
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,490
I see… I hadn’t seen him at all recently.
185
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,870
That’s too bad.
186
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,660
And we the Police Force have decided
to launch an all-out investigation.
187
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,330
Investigation?!
188
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,490
This is the will Shisui wrote.
189
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,870
The analysis of the handwriting
has been completed.
190
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,540
No mistake, he did indeed write it.
191
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,490
If there are no murder leads,
then what’s the investigation?
192
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,790
It’d be easy for a person who can use
Sharingan to copy handwriting, you see…
193
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,490
The most adept Uchiha.
194
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,490
The man feared as Shisui,
“the Instantaneous Man.”
195
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,830
He was a man who would take
the lead no matter what the mission
196
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,490
if it was for the sake of the clan.
197
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,290
It’s tough to think that
198
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,580
such a man would leave something
like this and kill himself.
199
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,410
You shouldn’t judge people…
only on looks and speculation.
200
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,040
For the time being,
I leave the will with you.
201
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,450
Take that and you request cooperation
in the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.
202
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Understood…
203
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,490
I hope we get a lead.
204
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,660
Also, we have a different route
to Anbu Black Ops.
205
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,410
We’ll know right away if you do something
like crushing the investigation request.
206
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,870
Why don’t you just come right out
and say it?
207
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,250
You suspect me, right?
208
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,370
Yeah. That’s right, you little punk…
209
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,870
Listen up, Itachi.
210
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,950
Just try doing something
like betraying the clan and…
211
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,870
it’ll cost you!
212
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,750
I told you before.
213
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,490
You shouldn’t judge people…
only on looks and speculation.
214
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,490
It’s because you take the liberty to
judge me as patient and take me lightly.
215
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,870
Clan…Clan…
216
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,410
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own vessels
217
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,620
and don’t know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there…
218
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,490
I’ve never seen him like this…
219
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,490
Shisui…was monitoring you recently…
220
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,120
Half a year after entering Anbu…
221
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,330
the strangeness of your behavior
couldn’t be overlooked.
222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,700
What the hell are you thinking?
223
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,660
Fixated on the organization,
224
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,870
fixated on the clan,
fixated on the name.
225
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,450
It’s a dreadful thing that constrains oneself
and labels one’s own vessel.
226
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,000
And it’s a foolish thing…
227
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,790
that fear and hate…
what one has never seen or known…
228
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,200
Stop, Itachi!
229
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,250
What the hell’s the matter
with you?!
230
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,750
Itachi…
You’ve been a little strange lately.
231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,580
I’m not strange at all.
232
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,830
I’m carrying out my own role…
That’s it.
233
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,830
Then why didn’t you come last night?
234
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,490
In order to elevate myself higher…
235
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,540
What’re you talking about…?
236
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,830
My vessel is dismayed
at this foolish clan!
237
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,160
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has all along
238
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,950
been in charge protecting
the peace of this village.
239
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,490
The Uchiha crest is a testament
to the proud clan.
240
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,200
That’s my boy…
241
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,830
I’ve great confidence
you’ll do great in Anbu Black Ops.
242
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,160
Because you're fixated
on insignificant things like clans…
243
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,750
you lose sight of what’s truly important.
244
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,120
True change cannot be made if stuck
within the restrictions of regulations,
245
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,490
and constrained predictions
and imagination…
246
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,870
Saying such arrogant things!
247
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,450
Enough! You’ll be imprisoned
if you say any more foolish nonsense.
248
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,540
Excellence is not easy at all.
249
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,910
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant…
250
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,000
even if you’re coveted
and sought after at first…
251
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,490
Why… Big Brother…?
252
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,200
What do you say?!
253
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,950
I can’t tolerate it anymore…
Captain, order imprisonment!
254
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,700
Big Brother! Stop it already!
255
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,540
I’m not the one who killed Shisui.
256
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,410
But I apologize for
my numerous slips of the tongue.
257
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,490
I’m very sorry…
258
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,490
Recently, it seems he’s been up
to his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions
259
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,410
and was a little tired…
260
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,500
Captain!
261
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,950
The Anbu Black Ops is a force
under the direct control of Lord Hokage…
262
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,750
Even we the Police Force can’t arrest him,
if we don’t have an arrest warrant.
263
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,660
And as for Itachi…
264
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,000
I will take the responsibility
and monitor him.
265
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,250
Please…
266
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,660
Understood…
267
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,750
With this, you’ve woken up, right?
268
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,500
We had a hindrance back at that time…
269
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,120
But it won’t be like that this time.
270
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,040
I’ll show you…
the true power of Sharingan.
271
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,700
When I recalled the parts one by one,
272
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,160
I felt as though
I had understood everything
273
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:45,620
Faded words which I kept so close to me
274
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:55,490
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
275
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,330
and this distant yearning for you
276
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:11,490
I live, simply repeating this cycle
277
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:23,330
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time
278
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:33,620
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
279
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,490
I’ll keep these thoughts…
280
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,000
Give me all you've got,
Naruto.
281
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,040
Or is this all you've got?
282
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,870
You were talking impudently
about your Way of Ninja
283
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,500
and this is all you've got?
284
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,490
You've gotta be kidding! Right now,
you're not even worth beating!
285
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,160
Next episode:
“Father and Son, the Broken Crest”
//%
1
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,990
I want to try and gather
the unrestrained winds
2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,830
I’ll run toward the horizon,
alongside the wave crests
3
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,370
I’ve made my decision,
4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,990
even if there’s a long way to go
on that road.
5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,620
I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:46,500
Time rushes us
The heartbeat speeds up
7
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:55,950
When I woke in the middle of a dream
I kept searching for that same light
8
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:06,750
Under the shining star-lit sky with
countless constellations and shadows
9
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:16,080
There was something beyond that…
What were you gazing at?
10
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,250
What were you gazing at?
11
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,290
It’s been a while since
I’ve eaten Ichiraku ramen!
12
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,990
Lately I’ve been away
from home on missions.
13
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,000
The bowl of ramen after
a mission…
14
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,200
it spreads to every muscle of the body
and becomes energy for tomorrow.
15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,080
If you eat ramen
it drives fatigue away.
16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,580
Ramen!
17
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,200
Ramen!
18
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,040
Ramen!
19
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,990
Ramen!
20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,290
Temporarily closed…?
21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,450
No, it can’t be…
22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:26,000
I endured all the tough missions,
looking forward to Ichiraku ramen…
23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,450
I can smell ramen!
24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,000
What?
25
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,620
You're right!
26
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,990
Without a doubt…
Ramen is being made in there!
27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,750
Ramen!
28
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,990
Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up!
Burn Copper Pot Burn!
29
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,250
This smell…
30
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,990
It’s the smell of a soup
31
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,450
that’s never been on
the Ichiraku menu before.
32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,000
Then… It's temporarily closed
to develop a new menu?
33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,990
Who’s there?!
34
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,990
A large helping of miso char siu ramen!
With an egg please.
35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,580
I see…
36
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,990
You were looking forward to
my ramen that much.
37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,990
Sorry about that.
38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,910
It’s okay to develop a new menu,
39
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,250
but I wish you’d do it
after the shop is closed.
40
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,540
Since you came all this way.
Give this a taste.
41
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Could this be…
42
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,660
Ichiraku’s new menu?!
43
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,990
Let’s eat!
44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,410
Wait a minute!
45
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,870
There are rules when you’re eating
a new ramen for the first time…
46
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,990
Rule ♪1!
47
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,700
Before you do anything,
48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,370
you must first have
a sip to taste the soup.
49
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,990
– Delicious! 					– Delicious!
50
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,660
Next, you have to coat the noodles
in soup and eat.
51
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,410
Huh? It seems like something
is missing…
52
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,950
Let’s get to the point.
53
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,910
The noodles are outdone
by the soup!
54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,290
This well-seasoned, rich soup
greatly surpasses
55
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,950
any of Ichiraku’s previous soups!
56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,990
But! The noodles are
the same as always!
57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,540
The balance is very bad.
58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,990
I cannot give it a passing score!
59
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,500
That’s what I thought…
60
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,330
Oh… Don’t get so depressed…
61
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,790
Ayame, water! Water please!
62
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,790
Huh? Where’s Ayame?
63
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,330
With ramen like this…
64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,290
I’ll never be able to get Ayame
back from the Ryonin.
65
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,580
Teuchi!
66
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,500
He’s just overtired.
67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,160
I had him drink an energy drink,
so after a little rest he'll recover.
68
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,080
But… I think he should take a break
from the shop for a while.
69
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,990
He’s been using his arms
too much…
70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,040
Look how swollen this is.
71
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,990
Come to think of it,
before he fell,
72
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,160
he said something about Ryonin
or whatever
73
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,000
did something to Ayame, I think…
74
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,000
Ayame is his daughter, right?
75
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,700
What’s Ryonin?
76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,330
I don’t know…
77
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,040
Ryonin…
He’s referring to the Ninja Chef.
78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,990
Ninja Chef?
79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,500
Do you know about them, Choji?
80
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,990
I’ve heard rumors about them…
81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,660
One of the problems Shinobi’s confront
on missions is the problem of meals!
82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,290
Normally Food Pills were brought
with them,
83
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,040
but the main role of those
are to supply nutrients.
84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,290
They have no taste.
85
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,990
If they could eat delicious food
while on missions,
86
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,120
would the success rate
of missions rise?
87
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,040
Based on that theory,
was born…
88
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,990
The Ninja Chef… Ryonin!
89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,370
But what those Ninja Chef
have to do with Ayame?
90
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,700
They snatched her away…
91
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,290
What?!
92
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,410
What are you talking about?!
93
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,990
Give us the details!
94
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,990
It was two weeks ago…
95
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,290
Ichiraku Ramen
96
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,990
Welcome!
97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,580
The large serving,
here’s your order!
98
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,250
A good job as always, Teuchi!
99
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,750
Hakkaku!
100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
His name is Hakkaku,
101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,290
long ago we trained at
the same ramen shop…
102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,500
He told me he is a Ninja Chef,
a Ryonin, these days.
103
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,540
Actually… I have a favor to ask you.
104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,160
What is it? If it’s something I can do,
I'll cooperate.
105
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,990
The phantom recipe that
I heard you developed…
106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,000
Please turn it over to me!
107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,290
Ph-Phantom recipe?
What are you talking about?
108
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,990
To a chef, a recipe is
more precious than life!
109
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,290
I understand why
you want to hide it!
110
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,450
But… please! Give it to me!
111
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,910
I really had no clue.
112
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,000
But Hakkaku didn’t believe me…
113
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,910
Ayame. Let’s get to work
opening the shop…
114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,040
What the… What’s this tray?
115
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,910
Ayame!
116
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,290
I have your daughter.
117
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,750
If you want her back,
hand over the “phantom recipe!”
118
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,500
Damn that Hakkaku!
119
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Why didn’t you contact
the Hokage right away!
120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
The Hokage could…
121
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,990
If I did that, I don’t know what
would happen to Ayame.
122
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,990
And he also wrote this
in the letter…
123
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,990
That if I can serve them
something impressive,
124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,700
he’ll give up on the phantom recipe
and return my daughter safe.
125
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,660
But, you've got a way to win?
126
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,950
I don’t know.
127
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,620
But a chef’s challenged me
to a cooking match.
128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,370
I have no choice but to do it.
129
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,580
So that’s why you’re developing
new ramen.
130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,910
I was able to make the soup
exactly how I wanted to.
131
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,200
But…I just can't get the firm noodles
that go with the soup…
132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,250
I can’t get Ayame back like this!
133
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,990
The cooking match is tomorrow…
What am I going to do?
134
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,660
I can’t imagine an Ichiraku
without Ayame.
135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,160
Okay! Teuchi! We’ll help you.
136
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,040
We’ll make the best ramen…
137
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,370
And get Ayame back…
138
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,870
From the Ryonin!
139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,910
You guys…
140
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,870
I'll teach you the basics
of making noodles.
141
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,540
Quickly mix the ingredients evenly.
142
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,700
If there are discrepancies,
143
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,450
there will be variations in
the taste of the noodles.
144
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,080
Next… Knead it.
145
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,000
If you don’t put this properly
the noodles won’t be firm.
146
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,250
Are you okay?
147
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,040
It's nothing. Don’t worry about me.
148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,120
And…stretch the noodles!
149
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,410
It’s important for them to be
of a uniform thickness!
150
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,620
So there will be no differences
after boiling…
151
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
Try it.
152
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,410
It’s easy to say it…
153
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,410
but to actually make the noodles
is not so easy.
154
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,580
It takes five years to become
an accomplished chef in his own right.
155
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,580
To do it by the match tomorrow
is completely…
156
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,330
When it comes down to it,
157
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,700
I’ll have to give up this decrepit body
of mine to them.
158
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,990
Teuchi…
159
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,290
You’re not thinking about
when you lose, are you?
160
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,330
Th-That’s…
161
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,990
Because if we are doing this,
162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
we’re doing it with the intention
of winning, believe it!
163
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,370
I absolutely don't forgive people
who hold a girl captive!
164
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,540
Cooking comes from the heart.
165
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,540
Technique and experience
aren’t everything!
166
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,990
No problem…
167
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,370
We’ll show them the real strength
of the Shinobi of Leaf Village!
168
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,790
Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku!
169
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,370
The phantom recipe?
170
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,250
You can’t tell by looking at me?
171
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,990
I see. How foolish…
172
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,700
Let me tell you,
173
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,990
ramen like the stuff I ate at
your shop the other day can't win.
174
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,620
Is Ayame okay?
175
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,450
Father!
176
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,160
Ayame!
177
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,870
The emotional reunion comes
after the match.
178
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,450
I have a favor to ask.
Let me have some helpers.
179
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,120
I don’t think those kids are up
to the task, but…
180
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,120
Well… That’s okay.
181
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,870
Well, let’s start the cooking match!
182
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,830
Let’s see if you can satisfy
all of us Ninja Chef!
183
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,870
There are so many of them…
184
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,120
We don’t have time to stand around…
Let’s begin!
185
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,990
The preparation for the soup
is done!
186
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,750
I’ll prepare the ingredients
for the rest!
187
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,370
I’m leaving the noodles to you!
188
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,450
– Okay! 					– Okay!
189
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,790
Listen. Our noodles determine
whether Ayame will return or not!
190
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,790
We cannot fail!
191
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,410
Seems like he’s done a good job
with the soup…
192
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,990
The delicious aroma is
wafting over here.
193
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,000
Indeed, it’s whetting my appetite.
194
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,910
The noodles are the problem!
195
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,990
Can those kids really make noodles that
will go with that soup?
196
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,790
First, mix the ingredients!
197
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,990
They’re amateurs,
I thought so!
198
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,870
You can’t make decent noodles
with that hand movement!
199
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,370
We practiced making noodles
all night!
200
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,040
But, we didn’t make the noodles
we wanted to by morning…
201
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,750
Even so, we have to
make perfect noodles!
202
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,990
Hey hey. At least make us
something edible!
203
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,370
Quickly…
204
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,410
Uniformly…
205
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,990
Without discrepancies!
206
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,120
Next, knead it!
207
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,080
Hey, Sakura!
208
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,450
Look, it’s Kakashi Sensei.
209
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,790
Don’t play!
210
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,580
Oh…
211
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,990
Sakura…
212
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,080
Oww! Sakura, you just can’t control
your own crazy strength!
213
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,750
It’s your fault for playing around
at a time like this!
214
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,990
This is…
215
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,080
This is…
the last of the ingredients.
216
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,990
No problem. This time, let us
show you we’ll succeed!
217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,870
Okay, I’m mixing.
218
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,660
Wait Choji! Leave this to me!
219
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,870
Naruto…
220
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,330
Hey, Sakura…
221
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,990
Huh?
222
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,120
We are Shinobi, right?
223
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,040
So then… Let’s show them
the Ninja way to make noodles!
224
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,080
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
225
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,990
Rasengen! “Ichiraku” version!
226
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,200
Wh-What?! Mixing ingredients
with Chakra?!
227
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,790
No, that way he’ll surely be able
to mix the ingredients uniformly!
228
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,370
And in micro units!
229
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,120
Sakura!
230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,950
What?
231
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,990
Pervy Sage.
232
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,080
Naruto!
233
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Cha!
234
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,790
Wh-What’s this crazy strength…?!
235
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,580
If she does that,
the noodles will become super firm!
236
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay, Sakura!
237
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Choji!
238
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,790
I, too…am a Shinobi of Leaf Village!
239
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,700
Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands!
240
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,540
What?!
241
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,040
What outstanding noodles!
242
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,990
If those noodles are added to
Teuchi’s soup, this match would…
243
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,870
W-We cannot lose!
244
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,790
It’s for the future of the Ninja Chef!
245
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,700
Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi!
246
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,990
Okay! Leave it to me!
247
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,700
Wait a minute!
248
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,830
When the ramen is done…
249
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,000
Who will you serve it to first?
250
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,990
Huh? Who…?
251
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,990
Th-That’s right…
That’s how it is!
252
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,500
That’s how what is?
253
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,540
Among the chefs…
254
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,000
there’s a cardinal rule
not to be forgotten.
255
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,540
The first guest to arrive is
the first guest served!
256
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,790
No matter how delicious
the food you make is…
257
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,990
if you break this cardinal rule,
you’re disqualified as a chef!
258
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,990
True, if a guy who came later
were eating before me,
259
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,450
then it would seriously pisses me off.
260
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,500
There are 100 Ninja Chefs here…
261
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,160
They all showed up at about
the same time!
262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,040
So you have to serve ramen
to 100 people at the same time!
263
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,910
You’re four people…
264
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,410
Can you really serve at
the same time?
265
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,990
I said we’re Ninja, didn’t I?
266
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,080
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
267
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,250
What?!
268
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,750
Now! Lift them!
269
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,750
– Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
– Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
270
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,080
– Oh… 					– Oh…
271
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,250
Th-The taste is the issue!
lf you don’t satisfy us, you lose!
272
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,910
Delicious!
273
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,990
– Delicious! 					– Delicious!
274
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,910
I’ve never had ramen this delicious.
275
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,410
So then…
276
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,990
We win!
277
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,200
– We did it! 					– We did it!
278
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,700
The truth is…
279
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,000
We Ninja Chefs are at
the end of our rope…
280
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,870
End of your rope?
281
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,000
What do you mean by that?
282
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,790
We endeavored to make
delicious meals to eat during missions…
283
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,990
We thought to make delicious food,
to fill your stomach…
284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
that can be eaten anywhere…
285
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,620
But we pursued taste too far.
286
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,120
It was too delicious, people were
compelled to overeat.
287
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,660
And as a result…
288
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,330
Ninja gained weight,
and it interfered with their missions.
289
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,950
And some people are now saying,
290
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,700
“we don’t need
the Ninja Chefs anymore.”
291
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,330
– Oh… 					– Oh…
292
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,540
For us Ninja Chefs
to continue,
293
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,580
we had to get our hands on
the “phantom” recipe out there
294
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,200
in the cooking world!
295
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,750
Recipe?
296
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,990
If we use this recipe,
297
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,790
we can improve the performance
of Shinobi without causing a burden.
298
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,990
There’s such recipe…?
299
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,450
I hear, it’s called
“the scum recipe.”
300
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,580
– The scum recipe?!
– The scum recipe?!
301
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,700
We've gathered information
from everywhere…
302
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,990
As a result,
303
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,040
we learned that the scum recipe
was at "Ichiraku" which Teuchi run.
304
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,290
– What?! 					– What?!
305
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,990
I-I don’t know!
306
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,830
There’s no reason something like that
should be at my shop!
307
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,370
There’s someone who heard it!
308
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,000
I've got "the scum recipe"
at my shop, so…
309
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,120
Oh… Teuchi…?
310
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,500
Oh. I might have that.
311
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,620
Are you serious?!
312
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,040
I thought so!
313
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,370
To be precise…
lt’s the “scum removal recipe.”
314
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,700
– Scum removal?
– Scum removal?
315
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,990
The trick to making delicious soup…
316
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,910
is how well you
remove the scum.
317
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,990
So I, too, studied a lot.
318
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,990
Eventually, I worked out a recipe
that can remove the scum effectively.
319
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,700
Usually it's called
“the scum recipe” for short…
320
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,990
I never thought that
this misunderstanding would arise.
321
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,290
That’s a pretty big omission.
322
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,830
Geez. That’s a stupid punch line…
323
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,990
We won the cooking match,
324
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,120
so keep your promise
and return Ayame!
325
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,040
That’s right! Where is she?!
326
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,750
Father!
327
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,200
Aya…me?
328
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,450
Ayame…is that you?
329
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,000
Can’t you tell by looking?
330
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,080
B-But Ayame is like…
331
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,990
The food they make is
so delicious, I overeat…
332
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,580
Did I gain that much weight?
333
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,990
Ayame!
334
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,990
Ichiraku’s new menu?
335
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,990
The thing we made
at the cooking challenge?
336
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,620
No, a diet ramen
that’s popular among girls.
337
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,200
Diet Ramen?
338
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,000
It’s super popular!
339
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,290
Oh, come on in, Naruto.
340
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,910
You’ve regained
your former shape…
341
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,040
It’s thanks to my father’s
diet ramen!
342
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,040
Huh? Where's your father?
343
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,620
Well… While he was joining me
in eating the diet ramen…
344
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,580
Hey… Naruto.
345
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,660
That’s a little too thin, believe it.
346
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,200
The wind blows, Ah…
347
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,990
The pain,
The memories won’t disappear
348
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,700
What should be brought along?
349
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,700
Assemble them into a piece.
350
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,790
There is no second chance, never
351
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,250
How foolish it is to throw away
352
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,580
Acting so innocently, Ah…
353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,410
The images.
354
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,500
It probably will not end
355
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,990
It probably will not end
356
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,750
Burn that love-filled heart,
357
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,830
Sail across a thousand dreams
358
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,870
Running freely
359
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,410
To take hold of the world in hand
360
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,540
The clouds scatter
361
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,500
The sun sets yet again
362
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:36,000
The solo parade begins to move.
363
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,330
Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
364
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,950
Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
365
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,040
Does anyone have anything
to ask about this mission?
366
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,990
I’ve got a question!
367
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,870
Why should I have to go on
a mission with this group?
368
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,990
Okay, let’s move on.
Everyone ready?
369
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,080
Hey, I’ve got a question, believe it!
370
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,290
As for the mission details,
371
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,990
we’re to eliminate the Demon of the Ocean
in the Land of Oceans.
372
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,540
You guys are going to get
fired up for me
373
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,990
since you came to serve under me!
374
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,540
Just a minute.
Hey, listen to me!
375
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,990
Now, let’s get going!
376
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,370
Stop complaining and
just come with me!
377
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,450
Listen to me, I say.
Listen! Listen! Listen!
378
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,120
Next time:
“Remembrance: The Lost Page”
